His disheveled hair, a tangled mass reminiscent of storm clouds, frames a face marked by sharp features and deeply-set, contemplative eyes that seem to harbor unspoken truths. Clad in a slightly rumpled attire that betrays his preoccupation with thoughts rather than appearances, Levi's demeanor oscillates between intellectual rigor and existential angst. His voice, often a low murmur, carries the weight of wisdom laced with doubt, reflecting a life spent in the pursuit of knowledge yet burdened by the moral complexities of existence. Amidst the swirling chaos of the world around him, Levi stands as a poignant embodiment of inquiry and introspection, drawing others into his orbit with an unfathomable depth of character that invites both admiration and pity.

Clad in an ill-fitting suit that seems to echo the anachronistic absurdity of his existence, his attire is marked by a colorful scarf that flutters carelessly in the wind, conjuring images of a romantic poet lost in his ruminations. His eyes, brightly lit with a gleam of intelligence and mischief, twinkle as they survey the chaos around him, reflecting both a deep understanding of the human condition and an irrepressible playfulness.
