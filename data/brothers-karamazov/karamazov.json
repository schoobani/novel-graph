            "0": "Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch\nKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and\nstill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which\nhappened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper\nplace. For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so we\nused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own\nestate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a\ntype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one\nof those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after\ntheir worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor\nPavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of\nthe smallest; he ran to dine at other men’s tables, and fastened on\nthem as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred\nthousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life\none of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I\nrepeat, it was not stupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows\nare shrewd and intelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a\npeculiar national form of it.",
            "1": "He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his\nfirst wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich\nand distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the\nMiüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty,\nand moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in\nthis generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have\nmarried such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won’t\nattempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the last “romantic”\ngeneration who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a\ngentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment,\ninvented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing\nherself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high\nbank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own\ncaprice, and to be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, if this\nprecipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less\npicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most\nlikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and\nprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or\nthree generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s action was similarly, no\ndoubt, an echo of other people’s ideas, and was due to the irritation\ncaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her\nfeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism\nof her family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must\nsuppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his\nparasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that\nprogressive epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill‐natured buffoon and\nnothing more. What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded\nby an elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy.\nFyodor Pavlovitch’s position at the time made him specially eager for\nany such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career\nin one way or another. To attach himself to a good family and obtain a\ndowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love it did not exist\napparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of Adelaïda\nIvanovna’s beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the\nlife of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a voluptuous temper, and\nready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement. She\nseems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his\nsenses.",
            "2": "Immediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flash\nthat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage\naccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary\nrapidity. Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and\napportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to\nlead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between\nthem. It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more\ngenerosity and dignity than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known,\ngot hold of all her money up to twenty‐five thousand roubles as soon as\nshe received it, so that those thousands were lost to her for ever. The\nlittle village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her\ndowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by\nmeans of some deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded,\nmerely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from\nthe contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless\nimportunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna’s family intervened\nand circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact that frequent\nfights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that\nFyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was beaten by her, for she\nwas a hot‐tempered, bold, dark‐browed, impatient woman, possessed of\nremarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the house and ran away\nfrom Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student, leaving\nMitya, a child of three years old, in her husband’s hands. Immediately\nFyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house, and\nabandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he used to\ndrive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all of\nAdelaïda Ivanovna’s having left him, going into details too disgraceful\nfor a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed\nto gratify him and flatter his self‐love most was to play the\nridiculous part of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with\nembellishments.",
            "3": "“One would think that you’d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you\nseem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,” scoffers said to him. Many\neven added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the\nbuffoon, and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to\nbe unaware of his ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been\nsimplicity. At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway\nwife. The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone\nwith her divinity student, and where she had thrown herself into a life\nof complete emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling\nabout, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he\ncould not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but\nhaving determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself\nfor the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just at that\ntime his wife’s family received the news of her death in Petersburg.\nShe had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of\ntyphus, or as another version had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch\nwas drunk when he heard of his wife’s death, and the story is that he\nran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands\nto Heaven: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,” but\nothers say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so\nthat people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired.\nIt is quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at\nhis release, and at the same time wept for her who released him. As a\ngeneral rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naïve and\nsimple‐hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too."

            "0": "You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he\nwould bring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what\nmight be expected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage\nwith Adelaïda Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial\ngrievances, but simply because he forgot him. While he was wearying\nevery one with his tears and complaints, and turning his house into a\nsink of debauchery, a faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the\nthree‐year‐old Mitya into his care. If he hadn’t looked after him there\nwould have been no one even to change the baby’s little shirt.",
            "1": "It happened moreover that the child’s relations on his mother’s side\nforgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his\nwidow, Mitya’s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill,\nwhile his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a\nwhole year in old Grigory’s charge and lived with him in the servant’s\ncottage. But if his father had remembered him (he could not, indeed,\nhave been altogether unaware of his existence) he would have sent him\nback to the cottage, as the child would only have been in the way of\nhis debaucheries. But a cousin of Mitya’s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch\nMiüsov, happened to return from Paris. He lived for many years\nafterwards abroad, but was at that time quite a young man, and\ndistinguished among the Miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of\nEuropean culture, who had been in the capitals and abroad. Towards the\nend of his life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties\nand fifties. In the course of his career he had come into contact with\nmany of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and abroad.\nHe had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in his declining\nyears was very fond of describing the three days of the Paris\nRevolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost taken\npart in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most\ngrateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of\nabout a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate\nlay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of\nour famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless\nlawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the\nrights of fishing in the river or wood‐cutting in the forest, I don’t\nknow exactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man\nof culture to open an attack upon the “clericals.” Hearing all about\nAdelaïda Ivanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had\nat one time been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he\nintervened, in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for\nFyodor Pavlovitch. He made the latter’s acquaintance for the first\ntime, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child’s\neducation. He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch,\nthat when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some\ntime as though he did not understand what child he was talking about,\nand even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in\nthe house. The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been\nsomething like the truth.",
            "2": "Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing\nan unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even\nto his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case.\nThis habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of\npeople, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.\nPyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously, and was\nappointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had\na small property, a house and land, left him by his mother. Mitya did,\nin fact, pass into this cousin’s keeping, but as the latter had no\nfamily of his own, and after securing the revenues of his estates was\nin haste to return at once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one\nof his cousins, a lady living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling\npermanently in Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the\nRevolution of February broke out, making an impression on his mind that\nhe remembered all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya\npassed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe he\nchanged his home a fourth time later on. I won’t enlarge upon that now,\nas I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s firstborn,\nand must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him,\nwithout which I could not begin my story.",
            "3": "In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the\nonly one of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s three sons who grew up in the belief\nthat he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of\nage. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his\nstudies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to\nthe Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the\nranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal\nof money. He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch\nuntil he came of age, and until then got into debt. He saw and knew his\nfather, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he\nvisited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his\nproperty. He seems not to have liked his father. He did not stay long\nwith him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in\nobtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future\npayments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was\nunable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement\nfrom his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then\n(this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated\nidea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with\nthis, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the\nyoung man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and\ndissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be\nsatisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor\nPavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him from time\nto time small doles, installments. In the end, when four years later,\nMitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle\nup once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he\nhad nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had\nreceived the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor\nPavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various\nagreements into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various\nprevious dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and\nso on. The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating,\nand was almost beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to\nthe catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first\nintroductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I\npass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s other two\nsons, and of their origin."

        "title": "III.\nThe Second Marriage And The Second Family",
        "content": {
            "0": "Very shortly after getting his four‐year‐old Mitya off his hands Fyodor\nPavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight\nyears. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young\ngirl, from another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of\nbusiness in company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard\nand a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and\nmanaged his business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not\nover‐ scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure\ndeacon, and was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She\ngrew up in the house of a general’s widow, a wealthy old lady of good\nposition, who was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know\nthe details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and\ngentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in which she was\nhanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her sufferings from\nthe caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was\napparently not bad‐hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant\nthrough idleness.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and\nhe was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an\nelopement to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would\nnot on any account have married him if she had known a little more\nabout him in time. But she lived in another province; besides, what\ncould a little girl of sixteen know about it, except that she would be\nbetter at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress.\nSo the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor\nPavlovitch did not get a penny this time, for the general’s widow was\nfurious. She gave them nothing and cursed them both. But he had not\nreckoned on a dowry; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the\ninnocent girl, above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar\nattraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only the\ncoarser types of feminine beauty.",
            "1": "“Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,” he used to say\nafterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this\nmight, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had\nreceived no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her “from\nthe halter,” he did not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel\nthat she had “wronged” him, he took advantage of her phenomenal\nmeekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of\nmarriage. He gathered loose women into his house, and carried on orgies\nof debauchery in his wife’s presence. To show what a pass things had\ncome to, I may mention that Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate,\nargumentative servant, who had always hated his first mistress,\nAdelaïda Ivanovna, took the side of his new mistress. He championed her\ncause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a\nservant, and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the\ndisorderly women out of the house. In the end this unhappy young woman,\nkept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous\ndisease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to\nbe “possessed by devils.” At times after terrible fits of hysterics she\neven lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and\nAlexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three\nyears later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and,\nstrange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life,\nlike a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing\nhappened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They\nwere completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were\nlooked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they\nwere found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother.\nShe was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the\ninsult done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as\nto her Sofya’s manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous\nsurroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers:\n\n“It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.”",
            "2": "Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna’s death the general’s widow\nsuddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\nhouse. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great\ndeal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for\nthose eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly\nupon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she gave him two\ngood, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and\nshook him three times up and down. Then, without a word, she went\nstraight to the cottage to the two boys. Seeing, at the first glance,\nthat they were unwashed and in dirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory,\ntoo, a box on the ear, and announcing that she would carry off both the\nchildren she wrapped them just as they were in a rug, put them in the\ncarriage, and drove off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like\na devoted slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to\nher carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,\n“God would repay her for the orphans.” “You are a blockhead all the\nsame,” the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing,\nand did not refuse the general’s widow his formal consent to any\nproposition in regard to his children’s education. As for the slaps she\nhad given him, he drove all over the town telling the story.",
            "3": "It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the\nboys in her will a thousand roubles each “for their instruction, and so\nthat all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so\nportioned out as to last till they are twenty‐one, for it is more than\nadequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to\nthrow away their money, let them.” I have not read the will myself, but\nI heard there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically\nexpressed. The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of\nNobility of the province, turned out, however, to be an honest man.\nWriting to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could\nextract nothing from him for his children’s education (though the\nlatter never directly refused but only procrastinated as he always did\nin such cases, and was, indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim\nPetrovitch took a personal interest in the orphans. He became\nespecially fond of the younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as\none of his family. I beg the reader to note this from the beginning.\nAnd to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to\nbe met with, the young people were more indebted for their education\nand bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles left\nto them by the general’s widow intact, so that by the time they came of\nage their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of interest. He\neducated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent far more\nthan a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won’t enter into a\ndetailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a\nfew of the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say\nthat he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid\nboy. At ten years old he had realized that they were living not in\ntheir own home but on other people’s charity, and that their father was\na man of whom it was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early,\nalmost in his infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and\nunusual aptitude for learning. I don’t know precisely why, but he left\nthe family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a\nMoscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated\nteacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare\nafterwards that this was all due to the “ardor for good works” of Yefim\nPetrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the boy’s genius should\nbe trained by a teacher of genius. But neither Yefim Petrovitch nor\nthis teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium\nand entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision\nfor the payment of the tyrannical old lady’s legacy, which had grown\nfrom one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to formalities\ninevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits for the\nfirst two years at the university, as he was forced to keep himself all\nthe time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt\nto communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for\nhim, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that from\nsuch a father he would get no real assistance. However that may have\nbeen, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting\nwork, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting\nparagraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature\nof “Eye‐Witness.” These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting\nand piquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young\nman’s practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy\nand unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of\nthe newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than\neverlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.\nHaving once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always\nkept up his connection with them, and in his latter years at the\nuniversity he published brilliant reviews of books upon various special\nsubjects, so that he became well known in literary circles. But only in\nhis last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a\nfar wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and\nremembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had just left\nthe university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand\nroubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important\njournals a strange article, which attracted general notice, on a\nsubject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing, as he was\na student of natural science. The article dealt with a subject which\nwas being debated everywhere at the time—the position of the\necclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject\nhe went on to explain his own view. What was most striking about the\narticle was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church\nparty regarded him unquestioningly as on their side. And yet not only\nthe secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause.\nFinally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but\nan impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly\nbecause this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our\nneighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the\nquestion of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by\nit. Learning the author’s name, they were interested in his being a\nnative of the town and the son of “that Fyodor Pavlovitch.” And just\nthen it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.",
            "4": "Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at\nthe time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the\nfirst step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to\nmyself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so\nlearned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit\nsuch an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life,\nhardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any\ncircumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that\nhis sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here\nthe young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been\nliving with him for two months, and they were on the best possible\nterms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as\nwell as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of whom we have spoken\nalready, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s first wife, happened to be\nin the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from\nParis, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was more\nsurprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man,\nwho interested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not\nwithout an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.\n\n“He is proud,” he used to say, “he will never be in want of pence; he\nhas got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every\none can see that he hasn’t come for money, for his father would never\ngive him any. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his\nfather can’t do without him. They get on so well together!”\n\nThat was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over\nhis father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and\neven seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and\neven spitefully perverse.\n\nIt was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the\nrequest of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he\nsaw for the first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving\nMoscow been in correspondence with him about an important matter of\nmore concern to Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader\nwill learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special\ncircumstance I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure,\nand thought his visit rather mysterious.",
            "5": "I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator\nbetween his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open\nquarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against\nhim.\n\nThe family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of\nits members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,\nAlexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the\nthree to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult\nto speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account\nof him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to\nintroduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes,\nhe had been for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to\nbe cloistered there for the rest of his life."

            "0": "He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty‐fourth year at\nthe time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty‐seven. First of\nall, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic,\nand, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give\nmy full opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of\nhumanity, and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at\nthat time it struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul\nstruggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of\nlove. And the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found\nin it at that time, as he thought, an extraordinary being, our\ncelebrated elder, Zossima, to whom he became attached with all the warm\nfirst love of his ardent heart. But I do not dispute that he was very\nstrange even at that time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I\nhave mentioned already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in\nhis fourth year he remembered her all his life—her face, her caresses,\n“as though she stood living before me.” Such memories may persist, as\nevery one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but\nscarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out\nof darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all\nfaded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was with\nhim. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the\nslanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of\nall); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp,\nand on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with\ncries and moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close\ntill it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out\nin both arms to the image as though to put him under the Mother’s\nprotection ... and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her\nin terror. That was the picture! And Alyosha remembered his mother’s\nface at that minute. He used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful\nas he remembered. But he rarely cared to speak of this memory to any\none. In his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive, and\ntalked little indeed, but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability;\nquite the contrary, from something different, from a sort of inner\npreoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people, but\nso important to him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on\naccount of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life\nto put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a\nsimpleton or naïve person. There was something about him which made one\nfeel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did not\ncare to be a judge of others—that he would never take it upon himself\nto criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. He seemed,\nindeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though\noften grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could\nsurprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty\nto his father’s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he,\nchaste and pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on\nwas unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or\ncondemnation. His father, who had once been in a dependent position,\nand so was sensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with\ndistrust and sullenness. “He does not say much,” he used to say, “and\nthinks the more.” But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to\nembracing him and kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with\nsottish sentimentality, yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection\nfor him, such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one\nbefore.",
            "1": "Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was so\nfrom his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his\npatron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts\nof all the family, so that they looked on him quite as their own child.\nYet he entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have\nacted from design nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift\nof making himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him,\nin his very nature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he\nseemed to be just one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes\nridiculed, and even disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for\ninstance, and rather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond\nof creeping into a corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite\nall the while he was at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any\none could see at the first glance that this was not from any\nsullenness. On the contrary he was bright and good‐tempered. He never\ntried to show off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he\nwas never afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that\nhe was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he\nwas bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen\nthat an hour after the offense he would address the offender or answer\nsome question with as trustful and candid an expression as though\nnothing had happened between them. And it was not that he seemed to\nhave forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront, but simply that\nhe did not regard it as an affront, and this completely conquered and\ncaptivated the boys. He had one characteristic which made all his\nschoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him, not\nfrom malice but because it amused them. This characteristic was a wild\nfanatical modesty and chastity. He could not bear to hear certain words\nand certain conversations about women. There are “certain” words and\nconversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure\nin mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among\nthemselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which\neven soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much\nthat soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite\nyoung children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no\nmoral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the\nappearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something\nrefined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha\nKaramazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of “that,” they\nused sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shout\nnastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor,\ntried to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring\ntheir insults in silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up\ntaunting him with being a “regular girl,” and what’s more they looked\nupon it with compassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in\nthe class but was never first.",
            "2": "At the time of Yefim Petrovitch’s death Alyosha had two more years to\ncomplete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went\nalmost immediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her\nwhole family, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to\nlive in the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies\nwhom he had never seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did\nnot know himself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he\nnever cared at whose expense he was living. In that respect he was a\nstriking contrast to his elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty\nfor his first two years in the university, maintained himself by his\nown efforts, and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living\nat the expense of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha’s\ncharacter must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the\nslightest acquaintance with him any one would have perceived that\nAlyosha was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious\nenthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a\nlarge fortune, would not hesitate to give it away for the asking,\neither for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he\nseemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a\nliteral sense. When he was given pocket‐money, which he never asked\nfor, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a\nmoment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with\nit.\n\nIn later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive on the\nscore of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following\njudgment, after getting to know Alyosha:\n\n“Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone\nwithout a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million\ninhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold\nand hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were\nnot, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no\neffort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on\nthe contrary, would probably be looked on as a pleasure.”",
            "3": "He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end\nof the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to\nsee his father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry\nand unwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and\nthe ladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from his\nbenefactor’s family. They provided him liberally with money and even\nfitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the\nmoney they gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his\narrival in the town he made no answer to his father’s first inquiry why\nhe had come before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say,\nunusually thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for\nhis mother’s tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that\nwas the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole\nreason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not understand\nand could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn\nhim irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor\nPavlovitch could not show him where his second wife was buried, for he\nhad never visited her grave since he had thrown earth upon her coffin,\nand in the course of years had entirely forgotten where she was buried.",
            "4": "Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been\nliving in our town. Three or four years after his wife’s death he had\ngone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he\nspent several years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own\nwords, “of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,” and ended by\nbeing received by “Jews high and low alike.” It may be presumed that at\nthis period he developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding\nmoney. He finally returned to our town only three years before\nAlyosha’s arrival. His former acquaintances found him looking terribly\naged, although he was by no means an old man. He behaved not exactly\nwith more dignity but with more effrontery. The former buffoon showed\nan insolent propensity for making buffoons of others. His depravity\nwith women was not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting.\nIn a short time he opened a great number of new taverns in the\ndistrict. It was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles\nor not much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were\nsoon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,\ntoo, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more\nuneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing\nand go on with another, as though he were letting himself go\naltogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not\nbeen for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged\nconsiderably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a\ntutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.\nAlyosha’s arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though\nsomething had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been\ndead in his soul.",
            "5": "“Do you know,” he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, “that you are\nlike her, ‘the crazy woman’ ”—that was what he used to call his dead\nwife, Alyosha’s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the “crazy\nwoman’s” grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed\nhim in a remote corner a cast‐iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept,\non which were inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date\nof her death, and below a four‐lined verse, such as are commonly used\non old‐fashioned middle‐class tombs. To Alyosha’s amazement this tomb\nturned out to be Grigory’s doing. He had put it up on the poor “crazy\nwoman’s” grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had\noften pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the\ngrave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the\nsight of his mother’s grave. He only listened to Grigory’s minute and\nsolemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood with bowed head\nand walked away without uttering a word. It was perhaps a year before\nhe visited the cemetery again. But this little episode was not without\nan influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch—and a very original one. He\nsuddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems\nfor the soul of his wife; but not for the second, Alyosha’s mother, the\n“crazy woman,” but for the first, Adelaïda Ivanovna, who used to thrash\nhim. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks\nto Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he had probably\nnever put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses\nof sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.",
            "6": "I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at\nthis time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the\nlife he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always\ninsolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep\nwrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam’s apple hung below his sharp\nchin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive,\nsensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips,\nbetween which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He\nslobbered every time he began to speak. He was fond indeed of making\nfun of his own face, though, I believe, he was well satisfied with it.\nHe used particularly to point to his nose, which was not very large,\nbut very delicate and conspicuously aquiline. “A regular Roman nose,”\nhe used to say, “with my goiter I’ve quite the countenance of an\nancient Roman patrician of the decadent period.” He seemed proud of it.\n\nNot long after visiting his mother’s grave Alyosha suddenly announced\nthat he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing\nto receive him as a novice. He explained that this was his strong\ndesire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his father. The\nold man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery\nhermitage, had made a special impression upon his “gentle boy.”\n\n“That is the most honest monk among them, of course,” he observed,\nafter listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely\nsurprised at his request. “H’m!... So that’s where you want to be, my\ngentle boy?”",
            "7": "He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half‐drunken grin,\nwhich was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness. “H’m!... I\nhad a presentiment that you would end in something like this. Would you\nbelieve it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you have\nyour own two thousand. That’s a dowry for you. And I’ll never desert\nyou, my angel. And I’ll pay what’s wanted for you there, if they ask\nfor it. But, of course, if they don’t ask, why should we worry them?\nWhat do you say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a\nweek. H’m!... Do you know that near one monastery there’s a place\noutside the town where every baby knows there are none but ‘the monks’\nwives’ living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been\nthere myself. You know, it’s interesting in its own way, of course, as\na variety. The worst of it is it’s awfully Russian. There are no French\nwomen there. Of course they could get them fast enough, they have\nplenty of money. If they get to hear of it they’ll come along. Well,\nthere’s nothing of that sort here, no ‘monks’ wives,’ and two hundred\nmonks. They’re honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it.... H’m.... So\nyou want to be a monk? And do you know I’m sorry to lose you, Alyosha;\nwould you believe it, I’ve really grown fond of you? Well, it’s a good\nopportunity. You’ll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much here.\nI’ve always been thinking who would pray for me, and whether there’s\nany one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I’m awfully stupid about\nthat. You wouldn’t believe it. Awfully. You see, however stupid I am\nabout it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking—from time to time, of\ncourse, not all the while. It’s impossible, I think, for the devils to\nforget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die. Then I\nwonder—hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do\nthey forge them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in\nthe monastery probably believe that there’s a ceiling in hell, for\ninstance. Now I’m ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It\nmakes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is. And,\nafter all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn’t? But,\ndo you know, there’s a damnable question involved in it? If there’s no\nceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks\ndown, which is unlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me\ndown to hell, and if they don’t drag me down what justice is there in\nthe world? _Il faudrait les inventer_, those hooks, on purpose for me\nalone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.”",
            "8": "“But there are no hooks there,” said Alyosha, looking gently and\nseriously at his father.\n\n“Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That’s how a\nFrenchman described hell: ‘_J’ai vu l’ombre d’un cocher qui avec\nl’ombre d’une brosse frottait l’ombre d’une carrosse._’ How do you know\nthere are no hooks, darling? When you’ve lived with the monks you’ll\nsing a different tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come\nand tell me. Anyway it’s easier going to the other world if one knows\nwhat there is there. Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the\nmonks than here with me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ...\nthough you’re like an angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say\nnothing will touch you there. That’s why I let you go, because I hope\nfor that. You’ve got all your wits about you. You will burn and you\nwill burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will wait\nfor you. I feel that you’re the only creature in the world who has not\ncondemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can’t help feeling\nit.”\n\nAnd he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was wicked and\nsentimental."

            "0": "Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly,\necstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer. On\nthe contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well‐grown, red‐cheeked,\nclear‐eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He was very handsome,\ntoo, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a\nregular, rather long, oval‐shaped face, and wide‐set dark gray, shining\neyes; he was very thoughtful, and apparently very serene. I shall be\ntold, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and\nmysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha was more of a realist than any one.\nOh! no doubt, in the monastery he fully believed in miracles, but, to\nmy thinking, miracles are never a stumbling‐block to the realist. It is\nnot miracles that dispose realists to belief. The genuine realist, if\nhe is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to\ndisbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as\nan irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than\nadmit the fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature\ntill then unrecognized by him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring\nfrom the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once\nbelieves, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous\nalso. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw,\nbut when he did see he said, “My Lord and my God!” Was it the miracle\nforced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because\nhe desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret\nheart even when he said, “I do not believe till I see.”",
            "1": "I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had not\nfinished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies is\ntrue, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.\nI’ll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon this path\nonly because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination and\npresented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his\nsoul from darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some extent a\nyouth of our last epoch—that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth,\nseeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once\nwith all the strength of his soul, seeking for immediate action, and\nready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it. Though these young\nmen unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many\ncases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for\ninstance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious\nstudy, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth\nand the cause they have set before them as their goal—such a sacrifice\nis utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path Alyosha chose\nwas a path going in the opposite direction, but he chose it with the\nsame thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he reflected seriously he\nwas convinced of the existence of God and immortality, and at once he\ninstinctively said to himself: “I want to live for immortality, and I\nwill accept no compromise.” In the same way, if he had decided that God\nand immortality did not exist, he would at once have become an atheist\nand a socialist. For socialism is not merely the labor question, it is\nbefore all things the atheistic question, the question of the form\ntaken by atheism to‐day, the question of the tower of Babel built\nwithout God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on\nearth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on\nliving as before. It is written: “Give all that thou hast to the poor\nand follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.”",
            "2": "Alyosha said to himself: “I can’t give two roubles instead of ‘all,’\nand only go to mass instead of ‘following Him.’ ” Perhaps his memories\nof childhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have\ntaken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to\nwhich his poor “crazy” mother had held him up still acted upon his\nimagination. Brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps\nonly to see whether here he could sacrifice all or only “two roubles,”\nand in the monastery he met this elder. I must digress to explain what\nan “elder” is in Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel\nvery competent to do so. I will try, however, to give a superficial\naccount of it in a few words. Authorities on the subject assert that\nthe institution of “elders” is of recent date, not more than a hundred\nyears old in our monasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially\nin Sinai and Athos, it has existed over a thousand years. It is\nmaintained that it existed in ancient times in Russia also, but through\nthe calamities which overtook Russia—the Tartars, civil war, the\ninterruption of relations with the East after the destruction of\nConstantinople—this institution fell into oblivion. It was revived\namong us towards the end of last century by one of the great\n“ascetics,” as they called him, Païssy Velitchkovsky, and his\ndisciples. But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and has\nsometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia. It\nflourished especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery. When\nand how it was introduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had\nalready been three such elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he\nwas almost dying of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take\nhis place. The question for our monastery was an important one, for it\nhad not been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they\nhad neither relics of saints, nor wonder‐working ikons, nor glorious\ntraditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been\nglorious all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom\npilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.",
            "3": "What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will,\ninto his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your\nown will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete self‐\nabnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is\nundertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self‐conquest, of self‐mastery,\nin order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that\nis, from self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole\nlife without finding their true selves in themselves. This institution\nof elders is not founded on theory, but was established in the East\nfrom the practice of a thousand years. The obligations due to an elder\nare not the ordinary “obedience” which has always existed in our\nRussian monasteries. The obligation involves confession to the elder by\nall who have submitted themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond\nbetween him and them.\n\nThe story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity\none such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his\nelder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after\ngreat exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a\nmartyr’s death for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a\nsaint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon’s exhortation, “Depart\nall ye unbaptized,” the coffin containing the martyr’s body left its\nplace and was cast forth from the church, and this took place three\ntimes. And only at last they learnt that this holy man had broken his\nvow of obedience and left his elder, and, therefore, could not be\nforgiven without the elder’s absolution in spite of his great deeds.\nOnly after this could the funeral take place. This, of course, is only\nan old legend. But here is a recent instance.",
            "4": "A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos, which he\nloved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to\nJerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north\nto Siberia: “There is the place for thee and not here.” The monk,\noverwhelmed with sorrow, went to the Œcumenical Patriarch at\nConstantinople and besought him to release him from his obedience. But\nthe Patriarch replied that not only was he unable to release him, but\nthere was not and could not be on earth a power which could release him\nexcept the elder who had himself laid that duty upon him. In this way\nthe elders are endowed in certain cases with unbounded and inexplicable\nauthority. That is why in many of our monasteries the institution was\nat first resisted almost to persecution. Meantime the elders\nimmediately began to be highly esteemed among the people. Masses of the\nignorant people as well as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to\nthe elders of our monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and\ntheir sufferings, and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the\nopponents of the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was\nbeing arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual\nopening of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing\nof the character of the sacrament. In the end, however, the institution\nof elders has been retained and is becoming established in Russian\nmonasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which had stood\nthe test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration of a man from\nslavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may be a two‐edged\nweapon and it may lead some not to humility and complete self‐control\nbut to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondage and not to freedom.",
            "5": "The elder Zossima was sixty‐five. He came of a family of landowners,\nhad been in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an\nofficer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality\nof his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond\nof him and let him wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was\nbound by no obligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for\nwhole days. Though he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not\nto be different from others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his\nyouthful imagination was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his\nelder. It was said that so many people had for years past come to\nconfess their sins to Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of\nadvice and healing, that he had acquired the keenest intuition and\ncould tell from an unknown face what a new‐comer wanted, and what was\nthe suffering on his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost\nalarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had\nspoken a word.",
            "6": "Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the\nfirst time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright\nand happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that\nFather Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always\nalmost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who\nwere more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him.\nThere were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some\nwho hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were\nsilent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery,\none, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict\nkeeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father\nZossima’s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts,\nwarmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and\ndeclared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could\nbe no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated\nmiracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from\nhis relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of\nthe elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the\ncoffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick\nchildren or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and\nto pray over them, return shortly after—some the next day—and, falling\nin tears at the elder’s feet, thank him for healing their sick.",
            "7": "Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the\nnatural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for\nAlyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher\nand rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own\ntriumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when\nthe elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd\nof pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from all parts of\nRussia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing. They fell\ndown before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth on which he\nstood, and wailed, while the women held up their children to him and\nbrought him the sick “possessed with devils.” The elder spoke to them,\nread a brief prayer over them, blessed them, and dismissed them. Of\nlate he had become so weak through attacks of illness that he was\nsometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrims waited for him to\ncome out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder why they loved him\nso, why they fell down before him and wept with emotion merely at\nseeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of the\nRussian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the\neverlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world’s, it\nwas the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to\nfall down before and worship.\n\n“Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere\non earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows\nthe truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to\nus, too, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.”\n\nAlyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned.\nHe understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and\ncustodian of God’s truth—of that he had no more doubt than the weeping\npeasants and the sick women who held out their children to the elder.\nThe conviction that after his death the elder would bring extraordinary\nglory to the monastery was even stronger in Alyosha than in any one\nthere, and, of late, a kind of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more\nand more strongly in his heart. He was not at all troubled at this\nelder’s standing as a solitary example before him.",
            "8": "“No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of renewal\nfor all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth,\nand all men will be holy and love one another, and there will be no\nmore rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the\nchildren of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will come.” That was\nthe dream in Alyosha’s heart.\n\nThe arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till then,\nseemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more quickly made\nfriends with his half‐brother Dmitri (though he arrived later) than\nwith his own brother Ivan. He was extremely interested in his brother\nIvan, but when the latter had been two months in the town, though they\nhad met fairly often, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was\nnaturally silent, and he seemed to be expecting something, ashamed\nabout something, while his brother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at\nfirst that he looked long and curiously at him, seemed soon to have\nleft off thinking of him. Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment.\nHe ascribed his brother’s indifference at first to the disparity of\ntheir age and education. But he also wondered whether the absence of\ncuriosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause\nentirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in\nsomething—something inward and important—that he was striving towards\nsome goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he had no\nthought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some\ncontempt on the part of the learned atheist for him—a foolish novice.\nHe knew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take\noffense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy\nembarrassment which he did not himself understand, he waited for his\nbrother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the\ndeepest respect and with a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha\nlearnt all the details of the important affair which had of late formed\nsuch a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers.\nDmitri’s enthusiastic references to Ivan were the more striking in\nAlyosha’s eyes since Dmitri was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated,\nand the two brothers were such a contrast in personality and character\nthat it would be difficult to find two men more unlike.",
            "9": "It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the\nmembers of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder\nwho had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for\nthis gathering was a false one. It was at this time that the discord\nbetween Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest stage and their\nrelations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to\nhave been the first to suggest, apparently in joke, that they should\nall meet in Father Zossima’s cell, and that, without appealing to his\ndirect intervention, they might more decently come to an understanding\nunder the conciliating influence of the elder’s presence. Dmitri, who\nhad never seen the elder, naturally supposed that his father was trying\nto intimidate him, but, as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts\nof temper with his father on several recent occasions, he accepted the\nchallenge. It must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with\nhis father, but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened\nthat Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was staying in the district at\nthe time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the forties and\nfifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom\nor the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the\ndesire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the\nmonastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the\nSuperior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming\nwith such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and\nconsideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from\nwithin the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had\nscarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his\nordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was\nfixed.\n\n“Who has made me a judge over them?” was all he said, smilingly, to\nAlyosha.",
            "10": "Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all\nthe wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could\nregard the interview seriously. All the others would come from\nfrivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well\naware of that. Ivan and Miüsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of\nthe coarsest kind, while his father might be contemplating some piece\nof buffoonery. Though he said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood\nhis father. The boy, I repeat, was far from being so simple as every\none thought him. He awaited the day with a heavy heart. No doubt he was\nalways pondering in his mind how the family discord could be ended. But\nhis chief anxiety concerned the elder. He trembled for him, for his\nglory, and dreaded any affront to him, especially the refined,\ncourteous irony of Miüsov and the supercilious half‐utterances of the\nhighly educated Ivan. He even wanted to venture on warning the elder,\ntelling him something about them, but, on second thoughts, said\nnothing. He only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his\nbrother Dmitri, that he loved him and expected him to keep his promise.\nDmitri wondered, for he could not remember what he had promised, but he\nanswered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let himself be\nprovoked “by vileness,” but that, although he had a deep respect for\nthe elder and for his brother Ivan, he was convinced that the meeting\nwas either a trap for him or an unworthy farce.\n\n“Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in\nrespect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,” he wrote in\nconclusion. Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter.\n\n\n\n\nBook II. An Unfortunate Gathering"

            "0": "It was a warm, bright day at the end of August. The interview with the\nelder had been fixed for half‐past eleven, immediately after late mass.\nOur visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it\nwas over. First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses,\ndrove up with Miüsov and a distant relative of his, a young man of\ntwenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This young man was preparing to\nenter the university. Miüsov, with whom he was staying for the time,\nwas trying to persuade him to go abroad to the university of Zurich or\nJena. The young man was still undecided. He was thoughtful and\nabsent‐minded. He was nice‐ looking, strongly built, and rather tall.\nThere was a strange fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very\nabsent‐minded people he would sometimes stare at a person without\nseeing him. He was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he\nwas alone with any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would\nlaugh at anything or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as\nit appeared. He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had\nalready some independent fortune and expectations of much more. He was\na friend of Alyosha’s.",
            "1": "In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old\npinkish‐gray horses, a long way behind Miüsov’s carriage, came Fyodor\nPavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been\ninformed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their\ncarriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of\nthe monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had\never seen the monastery, and Miüsov had probably not even been to\nchurch for thirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together\nwith assumed ease. But, except the church and the domestic buildings,\nthough these too were ordinary enough, he found nothing of interest in\nthe interior of the monastery. The last of the worshippers were coming\nout of the church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the\nhumbler people were a few of higher rank—two or three ladies and a very\nold general. They were all staying at the hotel. Our visitors were at\nonce surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything, except\nyoung Kalganov, who took a ten‐ copeck piece out of his purse, and,\nnervous and embarrassed—God knows why!—hurriedly gave it to an old\nwoman, saying: “Divide it equally.” None of his companions made any\nremark upon it, so that he had no reason to be embarrassed; but,\nperceiving this, he was even more overcome.\n\nIt was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they\nwere not received with special honor, though one of them had recently\nmade a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy\nand highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a\nsense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put\ntheir fishing rights in his hands. Yet no official personage met them.\n\nMiüsov looked absent‐mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and\nwas on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a\npretty penny for the right of lying in this “holy place,” but\nrefrained. His liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.\n\n“Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find\nout, for time is passing,” he observed suddenly, as though speaking to\nhimself.\n\nAll at once there came up a bald‐headed, elderly man with ingratiating\nlittle eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his hat, he\nintroduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula.\nHe at once entered into our visitors’ difficulty.",
            "2": "“Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from\nthe monastery, the other side of the copse.”\n\n“I know it’s the other side of the copse,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch,\n“but we don’t remember the way. It is a long time since we’ve been\nhere.”\n\n“This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse.\nCome with me, won’t you? I’ll show you. I have to go.... I am going\nmyself. This way, this way.”\n\nThey came out of the gate and turned towards the copse. Maximov, a man\nof sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them\nall, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity. His eyes looked\nstarting out of his head.\n\n“You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,” observed\nMiüsov severely. “That personage has granted us an audience, so to\nspeak, and so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot\nask you to accompany us.”\n\n“I’ve been there. I’ve been already; _un chevalier parfait_,” and\nMaximov snapped his fingers in the air.\n\n“Who is a _chevalier_?” asked Miüsov.\n\n“The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the\nmonastery, Zossima. Such an elder!”\n\nBut his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan‐looking monk\nof medium height, wearing a monk’s cap, who overtook them. Fyodor\nPavlovitch and Miüsov stopped.\n\nThe monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:\n\n“The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him\nafter your visit to the hermitage. At one o’clock, not later. And you\nalso,” he added, addressing Maximov.\n\n“That I certainly will, without fail,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely\ndelighted at the invitation. “And, believe me, we’ve all given our word\nto behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go,\ntoo?”\n\n“Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs\nhere? The only obstacle to me is your company....”\n\n“Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non‐existent as yet.”\n\n“It would be a capital thing if he didn’t turn up. Do you suppose I\nlike all this business, and in your company, too? So we will come to\ndinner. Thank the Father Superior,” he said to the monk.\n\n“No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,” answered the monk.\n\n“If so I’ll go straight to the Father Superior—to the Father Superior,”\nbabbled Maximov.\n\n“The Father Superior is engaged just now. But as you please—” the monk\nhesitated.\n\n“Impertinent old man!” Miüsov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to\nthe monastery.",
            "3": "“He’s like von Sohn,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly.\n\n“Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he like von Sohn? Have\nyou ever seen von Sohn?”\n\n“I’ve seen his portrait. It’s not the features, but something\nindefinable. He’s a second von Sohn. I can always tell from the\nphysiognomy.”\n\n“Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor\nPavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave\nproperly. Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you\nbegin to play the fool I don’t intend to be associated with you\nhere.... You see what a man he is”—he turned to the monk—“I’m afraid to\ngo among decent people with him.” A fine smile, not without a certain\nslyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he made\nno reply, and was evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity.\nMiüsov frowned more than ever.\n\n“Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries,\nand nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,” flashed through\nMiüsov’s mind.\n\n“Here’s the hermitage. We’ve arrived,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “The\ngates are shut.”\n\nAnd he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted\nabove and on the sides of the gates.\n\n“When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this\nhermitage there are twenty‐five saints being saved. They look at one\nanother, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate.\nThat’s what is remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that\nthe elder receives ladies,” he remarked suddenly to the monk.\n\n“Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there\nwaiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built\nadjoining the portico, but outside the precincts—you can see the\nwindows—and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he is\nwell enough. They are always outside the precincts. There is a Harkov\nlady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her sick daughter.\nProbably he has promised to come out to her, though of late he has been\nso weak that he has hardly shown himself even to the people.”\n\n“So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage\nto the ladies. Don’t suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. But do\nyou know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed,\nbut no creature of the female sex—no hens, nor turkey‐hens, nor cows.”\n\n“Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here.\nThey’ll turn you out when I’m gone.”",
            "4": "“But I’m not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,” he\ncried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, “what a vale of roses\nthey live in!”\n\nThough there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and\nbeautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and\nevidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower‐beds round the\nchurch, and between the tombs; and the one‐storied wooden house where\nthe elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.\n\n“And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He\ndidn’t care for such elegance. They say he used to jump up and thrash\neven ladies with a stick,” observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he went up\nthe steps.\n\n“The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great\ndeal that’s told is foolishness. He never thrashed any one,” answered\nthe monk. “Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce\nyou.”\n\n“Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear?\nBehave properly or I will pay you out!” Miüsov had time to mutter\nagain.\n\n“I can’t think why you are so agitated,” Fyodor Pavlovitch observed\nsarcastically. “Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he can tell by\none’s eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their\nopinion! you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I’m surprised at you.”\n\nBut Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm. They were asked to\ncome in. He walked in, somewhat irritated.\n\n“Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to\nquarrel—and lower myself and my ideas,” he reflected."

            "0": "They entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in\nfrom his bedroom. There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder,\ntwo monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other\nFather Païssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health,\nthough not old. There was also a tall young man, who looked about two\nand twenty, standing in the corner throughout the interview. He had a\nbroad, fresh face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was\nwearing ordinary dress. He was a divinity student, living under the\nprotection of the monastery. His expression was one of unquestioning,\nbut self‐respecting, reverence. Being in a subordinate and dependent\nposition, and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet\nthem with a bow.\n\nFather Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two\nmonks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground\nwith their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder\nreplied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The\nwhole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of\nfeeling, not like an everyday rite. But Miüsov fancied that it was all\ndone with intentional impressiveness. He stood in front of the other\nvisitors. He ought—he had reflected upon it the evening before—from\nsimple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to\nreceive the elder’s blessing, even if he did not kiss his hand. But\nwhen he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he\ninstantly changed his mind. With dignified gravity he made a rather\ndeep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch\ndid the same, mimicking Miüsov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great\ndignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his sides, while\nKalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall\nthe hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all\nto sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha’s cheeks. He was ashamed. His\nforebodings were coming true.",
            "1": "Father Zossima sat down on a very old‐fashioned mahogany sofa, covered\nwith leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the\nopposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black\nleather. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the window.\nThe divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The\ncell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained nothing but\nthe most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor quality. There were\ntwo pots of flowers in the window, and a number of holy pictures in the\ncorner. Before one huge ancient ikon of the Virgin a lamp was burning.\nNear it were two other holy pictures in shining settings, and, next\nthem, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a\nMater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign engravings from the\ngreat Italian artists of past centuries. Next to these costly and\nartistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints of\nsaints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the\nfairs. On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and\npresent.\n\nMiüsov took a cursory glance at all these “conventional” surroundings\nand bent an intent look upon the elder. He had a high opinion of his\nown insight, a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty, an age at\nwhich a clever man of the world of established position can hardly help\ntaking himself rather seriously. At the first moment he did not like\nZossima. There was, indeed, something in the elder’s face which many\npeople besides Miüsov might not have liked. He was a short, bent,\nlittle man, with very weak legs, and though he was only sixty‐five, he\nlooked at least ten years older. His face was very thin and covered\nwith a network of fine wrinkles, particularly numerous about his eyes,\nwhich were small, light‐colored, quick, and shining like two bright\npoints. He had a sprinkling of gray hair about his temples. His pointed\nbeard was small and scanty, and his lips, which smiled frequently, were\nas thin as two threads. His nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird’s\nbeak.\n\n“To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,” thought\nMiüsov. He felt altogether dissatisfied with his position.\n\nA cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to\nbegin the conversation.",
            "2": "“Precisely to our time,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “but no sign of my\nson, Dmitri. I apologize for him, sacred elder!” (Alyosha shuddered all\nover at “sacred elder.”) “I am always punctual myself, minute for\nminute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings....”\n\n“But you are not a king, anyway,” Miüsov muttered, losing his self‐\nrestraint at once.\n\n“Yes; that’s true. I’m not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself. But, there! I always say\nthe wrong thing. Your reverence,” he cried, with sudden pathos, “you\nbehold before you a buffoon in earnest! I introduce myself as such.\nIt’s an old habit, alas! And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place\nit’s with an object, with the object of amusing people and making\nmyself agreeable. One must be agreeable, mustn’t one? I was seven years\nago in a little town where I had business, and I made friends with some\nmerchants there. We went to the captain of police because we had to see\nhim about something, and to ask him to dine with us. He was a tall,\nfat, fair, sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases. It’s their\nliver. I went straight up to him, and with the ease of a man of the\nworld, you know, ‘Mr. Ispravnik,’ said I, ‘be our Napravnik.’ ‘What do\nyou mean by Napravnik?’ said he. I saw, at the first half‐second, that\nit had missed fire. He stood there so glum. ‘I wanted to make a joke,’\nsaid I, ‘for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our well‐known\nRussian orchestra conductor and what we need for the harmony of our\nundertaking is some one of that sort.’ And I explained my comparison\nvery reasonably, didn’t I? ‘Excuse me,’ said he, ‘I am an Ispravnik,\nand I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.’ He turned and walked\naway. I followed him, shouting, ‘Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a\nNapravnik.’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘since you called me a Napravnik I am one.’\nAnd would you believe it, it ruined our business! And I’m always like\nthat, always like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness.\nOnce, many years ago, I said to an influential person: ‘Your wife is a\nticklish lady,’ in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to\nspeak. But he asked me, ‘Why, have you tickled her?’ I thought I’d be\npolite, so I couldn’t help saying, ‘Yes,’ and he gave me a fine\ntickling on the spot. Only that happened long ago, so I’m not ashamed\nto tell the story. I’m always injuring myself like that.”\n\n“You’re doing it now,” muttered Miüsov, with disgust.",
            "3": "Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.\n\n“Am I? Would you believe it, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon\nas I began to speak. And do you know I foresaw, too, that you’d be the\nfirst to remark on it. The minute I see my joke isn’t coming off, your\nreverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the\nlower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them. That’s been so since I\nwas young, when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen’s\nfamilies. I am an inveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your\nreverence, it’s as though it were a craze in me. I dare say it’s a\ndevil within me. But only a little one. A more serious one would have\nchosen another lodging. But not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you’re\nnot a lodging worth having either. But I do believe—I believe in God,\nthough I have had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of\nwisdom. I’m like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. Did you ever\nhear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan\nPlaton, in the time of the Empress Catherine? He went in and said\nstraight out, ‘There is no God.’ To which the great bishop lifted up\nhis finger and answered, ‘The fool hath said in his heart there is no\nGod.’ And he fell down at his feet on the spot. ‘I believe,’ he cried,\n‘and will be christened.’ And so he was. Princess Dashkov was his\ngodmother, and Potyomkin his godfather.”\n\n“Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you’re telling lies\nand that that stupid anecdote isn’t true. Why are you playing the\nfool?” cried Miüsov in a shaking voice.\n\n“I suspected all my life that it wasn’t true,” Fyodor Pavlovitch cried\nwith conviction. “But I’ll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great\nelder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot’s christening I made up\njust now. I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I\nplay the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable. Though I\nreally don’t know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. And as for\nDiderot, I heard as far as ‘the fool hath said in his heart’ twenty\ntimes from the gentry about here when I was young. I heard your aunt,\nPyotr Alexandrovitch, tell the story. They all believe to this day that\nthe infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan\nPlaton....”\n\nMiüsov got up, forgetting himself in his impatience. He was furious,\nand conscious of being ridiculous.",
            "4": "What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. For forty or\nfifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had\nentered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration.\nAlmost every one admitted to the cell felt that a great favor was being\nshown him. Many remained kneeling during the whole visit. Of those\nvisitors, many had been men of high rank and learning, some even\nfreethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception had\nshown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here there was no\nquestion of money, but only, on the one side love and kindness, and on\nthe other penitence and eager desire to decide some spiritual problem\nor crisis. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered the\nspectators, or at least some of them. The monks, with unchanged\ncountenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the elder\nwould say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Miüsov. Alyosha\nstood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. What seemed to him\nstrangest of all was that his brother Ivan, on whom alone he had rested\nhis hopes, and who alone had such influence on his father that he could\nhave stopped him, sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently\nwaiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had nothing\nto do with it. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity\nstudent, whom he knew almost intimately. He alone in the monastery knew\nRakitin’s thoughts.\n\n“Forgive me,” began Miüsov, addressing Father Zossima, “for perhaps I\nseem to be taking part in this shameful foolery. I made a mistake in\nbelieving that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what\nwas due on a visit to so honored a personage. I did not suppose I\nshould have to apologize simply for having come with him....”\n\nPyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the\nroom, overwhelmed with confusion.\n\n“Don’t distress yourself, I beg.” The elder got on to his feeble legs,\nand taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him sit down again.\n“I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my\nguest.” And with a bow he went back and sat down again on his little\nsofa.\n\n“Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity?” Fyodor Pavlovitch\ncried suddenly, clutching the arms of his chair in both hands, as\nthough ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.",
            "5": "“I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be\nuneasy,” the elder said impressively. “Do not trouble. Make yourself\nquite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for\nthat is at the root of it all.”\n\n“Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I\naccept it with grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Father, you’d better\nnot invite me to be my natural self. Don’t risk it.... I will not go so\nfar as that myself. I warn you for your own sake. Well, the rest is\nstill plunged in the mists of uncertainty, though there are people\nwho’d be pleased to describe me for you. I mean that for you, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch. But as for you, holy being, let me tell you, I am\nbrimming over with ecstasy.”\n\nHe got up, and throwing up his hands, declaimed, “Blessed be the womb\nthat bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck—the paps especially.\nWhen you said just now, ‘Don’t be so ashamed of yourself, for that is\nat the root of it all,’ you pierced right through me by that remark,\nand read me to the core. Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that\nI am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon. So I say,\n‘Let me really play the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for\nyou are every one of you worse than I am.’ That is why I am a buffoon.\nIt is from shame, great elder, from shame; it’s simply\nover‐sensitiveness that makes me rowdy. If I had only been sure that\nevery one would accept me as the kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord,\nwhat a good man I should have been then! Teacher!” he fell suddenly on\nhis knees, “what must I do to gain eternal life?”\n\nIt was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really\nmoved.\n\nFather Zossima, lifting his eyes, looked at him, and said with a smile:\n\n“You have known for a long time what you must do. You have sense\nenough: don’t give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don’t\ngive way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money. And\nclose your taverns. If you can’t close all, at least two or three. And,\nabove all—don’t lie.”\n\n“You mean about Diderot?”",
            "6": "“No, not about Diderot. Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who\nlies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he\ncannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses\nall respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases\nto love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he\ngives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in\nhis vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself. The\nman who lies to himself can be more easily offended than any one. You\nknow it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn’t it? A man may\nknow that nobody has insulted him, but that he has invented the insult\nfor himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has\ncaught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill—he knows that\nhimself, yet he will be the first to take offense, and will revel in\nhis resentment till he feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to\ngenuine vindictiveness. But get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too,\nis deceitful posturing....”\n\n“Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss.”\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder’s\nthin hand. “It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so\nwell, as I never heard it before. Yes, I have been all my life taking\noffense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it\nis not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted—that\nyou had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished! I shall make a\nnote of that. But I have been lying, lying positively my whole life\nlong, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father\nof lies. Though I believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting\nmixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only\n... my angel ... I may sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no\nharm, though sometimes a word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I\nwas forgetting, though I had been meaning for the last two years to\ncome here on purpose to ask and to find out something. Only do tell\nPyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it\ntrue, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the _Lives of\nthe Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head\nwas cut off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, ‘courteously\nkissing it,’ walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true\nor not, honored Father?”",
            "7": "“No, it is untrue,” said the elder.\n\n“There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What\nsaint do you say the story is told of?” asked the Father Librarian.\n\n“I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can’t tell. I was\ndeceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who\ntold it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov here, who was so angry just now\nabout Diderot. He it was who told the story.”\n\n“I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.”\n\n“It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It\nwas three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story\nyou shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You knew nothing of it, but I\nwent home with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more\nshaken ever since. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a\ngreat fall. That was not a Diderot!”\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly\nclear to every one by now that he was playing a part again. Yet Miüsov\nwas stung by his words.\n\n“What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,” he muttered. “I may really\nhave told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it\nmyself. I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. He told me it was read at\nour mass from the _Lives of the Saints_ ... he was a very learned man\nwho had made a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long\ntime in Russia.... I have not read the _Lives of the Saints_ myself,\nand I am not going to read them ... all sorts of things are said at\ndinner—we were dining then.”\n\n“Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!” said Fyodor\nPavlovitch, mimicking him.\n\n“What do I care for your faith?” Miüsov was on the point of shouting,\nbut he suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, “You defile\neverything you touch.”\n\nThe elder suddenly rose from his seat. “Excuse me, gentlemen, for\nleaving you a few minutes,” he said, addressing all his guests. “I have\nvisitors awaiting me who arrived before you. But don’t you tell lies\nall the same,” he added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a\ngood‐humored face. He went out of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew\nto escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless: he was glad to\nget away, but he was glad, too, that the elder was good‐humored and not\noffended. Father Zossima was going towards the portico to bless the\npeople waiting for him there. But Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in\nstopping him at the door of the cell.",
            "8": "“Blessed man!” he cried, with feeling. “Allow me to kiss your hand once\nmore. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you\nthink I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been\nacting like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been\ntesting you all the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is\nthere room for my humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a\ntestimonial that one can get on with you! But now, I’ll be quiet; I\nwill keep quiet all the time. I’ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue.\nNow it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal\nperson left now—for ten minutes.”"

        "content": {
            "0": "Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the\nprecinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had\nbeen told that the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered\ntogether in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter,\nhad also come out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a\nseparate part of it set aside for women of rank.\n\nMadame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and\nalways dressed with taste. She was rather pale, and had lively black\neyes. She was not more than thirty‐three, and had been five years a\nwidow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. The\npoor child had not been able to walk for the last six months, and was\nwheeled about in a long reclining chair. She had a charming little\nface, rather thin from illness, but full of gayety. There was a gleam\nof mischief in her big dark eyes with their long lashes. Her mother had\nbeen intending to take her abroad ever since the spring, but they had\nbeen detained all the summer by business connected with their estate.\nThey had been staying a week in our town, where they had come more for\npurposes of business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once\nalready, three days before. Though they knew that the elder scarcely\nsaw any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently\nentreated “the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.”\n\nThe mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter’s invalid\ncarriage, and two paces from her stood an old monk, not one of our\nmonastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far\nnorth. He too sought the elder’s blessing.\n\nBut Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the\npeasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up\ninto the portico. Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his\nstole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy\nwoman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she\nbegan shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth.\nLaying the stole on her forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and\nshe was at once soothed and quieted.",
            "1": "I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened\nto see and hear these “possessed” women in the villages and\nmonasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and\nbark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church. But when\nthe sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the\n“possession” ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time.\nI was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard\nfrom country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness\nwas simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by\nsuitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this. But\nlater on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there\nis no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women\nare subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due\nto the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told,\narising from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and\nunassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from\nbeatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like\nothers. The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling\nwoman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been\nexplained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the\n“clericals,” arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women\nwho supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth\nbeyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not\nhold out if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to\nbow down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged\nwoman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place,\nand was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down to the\nsacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the\nimplicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did come to pass,\nthough only for a moment. It was exactly the same now as soon as the\nelder touched the sick woman with the stole.\n\nMany of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the\neffect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment,\nothers cried out in sing‐song voices.\n\nHe blessed them all and talked with some of them. The “possessed” woman\nhe knew already. She came from a village only six versts from the\nmonastery, and had been brought to him before.",
            "2": "“But here is one from afar.” He pointed to a woman by no means old but\nvery thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost\nblackened by exposure. She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare\nat the elder; there was something almost frenzied in her eyes.\n\n“From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from\nhere. From afar off, Father, from afar off!” the woman began in a\nsing‐song voice as though she were chanting a dirge, swaying her head\nfrom side to side with her cheek resting in her hand.\n\nThere is silent and long‐suffering sorrow to be met with among the\npeasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. But there is a grief\nthat breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds\nvent in wailing. This is particularly common with women. But it is no\nlighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by\nlacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire\nconsolation. It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations\nspring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound.\n\n“You are of the tradesman class?” said Father Zossima, looking\ncuriously at her.\n\n“Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live\nin the town. I have come to see you, O Father! We heard of you, Father,\nwe heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a\npilgrimage. I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, ‘Go,\nNastasya, go to them’—that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at\nthe service, and to‐day I have come to you.”\n\n“What are you weeping for?”",
            "3": "“It’s my little son I’m grieving for, Father. He was three years\nold—three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I’m in\nanguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my\nNikita and I, and now we’ve no children, our dear ones have all gone. I\nburied the first three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried\nthe last I can’t forget him. He seems always standing before me. He\nnever leaves me. He has withered my heart. I look at his little\nclothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and I wail. I lay out all\nthat is left of him, all his little things. I look at them and wail. I\nsay to Nikita, my husband, ‘Let me go on a pilgrimage, master.’ He is a\ndriver. We’re not poor people, Father, not poor; he drives our own\nhorse. It’s all our own, the horse and the carriage. And what good is\nit all to us now? My Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He’s\nsure to. It used to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he gives\nway to it. But now I don’t think about him. It’s three months since I\nleft home. I’ve forgotten him. I’ve forgotten everything. I don’t want\nto remember. And what would our life be now together? I’ve done with\nhim, I’ve done. I’ve done with them all. I don’t care to look upon my\nhouse and my goods. I don’t care to see anything at all!”\n\n“Listen, mother,” said the elder. “Once in olden times a holy saint saw\nin the Temple a mother like you weeping for her little one, her only\none, whom God had taken. ‘Knowest thou not,’ said the saint to her,\n‘how bold these little ones are before the throne of God? Verily there\nare none bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. “Thou didst give us\nlife, O Lord,” they say, “and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou\ndidst take it back again.” And so boldly they ask and ask again that\nGod gives them at once the rank of angels. Therefore,’ said the saint,\n‘thou, too, O mother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with\nthe Lord in the fellowship of the angels.’ That’s what the saint said\nto the weeping mother of old. He was a great saint and he could not\nhave spoken falsely. Therefore you too, mother, know that your little\none is surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and\npraying to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.”\n\nThe woman listened to him, looking down with her cheek in her hand. She\nsighed deeply.",
            "4": "“My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. ‘Foolish\none,’ he said, ‘why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels\nbefore God.’ He says that to me, but he weeps himself. I see that he\ncries like me. ‘I know, Nikita,’ said I. ‘Where could he be if not with\nthe Lord God? Only, here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside\nus before.’ And if only I could look upon him one little time, if only\nI could peep at him one little time, without going up to him, without\nspeaking, if I could be hidden in a corner and only see him for one\nlittle minute, hear him playing in the yard, calling in his little\nvoice, ‘Mammy, where are you?’ If only I could hear him pattering with\nhis little feet about the room just once, only once; for so often, so\noften I remember how he used to run to me and shout and laugh, if only\nI could hear his little feet I should know him! But he’s gone, Father,\nhe’s gone, and I shall never hear him again. Here’s his little sash,\nbut him I shall never see or hear now.”\n\nShe drew out of her bosom her boy’s little embroidered sash, and as\nsoon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs, hiding her eyes\nwith her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.\n\n“It is Rachel of old,” said the elder, “weeping for her children, and\nwill not be comforted because they are not. Such is the lot set on\nearth for you mothers. Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you\nneed. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. Only every time that you weep\nbe sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God,\nthat he looks down from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your\ntears, and points at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will\nyou keep that great mother’s grief. But it will turn in the end into\nquiet joy, and your bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow\nthat purifies the heart and delivers it from sin. And I shall pray for\nthe peace of your child’s soul. What was his name?”\n\n“Alexey, Father.”\n\n“A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?”\n\n“Yes, Father.”",
            "5": "“What a saint he was! I will remember him, mother, and your grief in my\nprayers, and I will pray for your husband’s health. It is a sin for you\nto leave him. Your little one will see from heaven that you have\nforsaken his father, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his\nhappiness? He is living, for the soul lives for ever, and though he is\nnot in the house he is near you, unseen. How can he go into the house\nwhen you say that the house is hateful to you? To whom is he to go if\nhe find you not together, his father and mother? He comes to you in\ndreams now, and you grieve. But then he will send you gentle dreams. Go\nto your husband, mother; go this very day.”\n\n“I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You’ve gone straight to my\nheart. My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,” the woman began\nin a sing‐song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very\nold woman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim. Her\neyes showed that she had come with an object, and in order to say\nsomething. She said she was the widow of a non‐commissioned officer,\nand lived close by in the town. Her son Vasenka was in the commissariat\nservice, and had gone to Irkutsk in Siberia. He had written twice from\nthere, but now a year had passed since he had written. She did inquire\nabout him, but she did not know the proper place to inquire.\n\n“Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna—she’s a rich merchant’s\nwife—said to me, ‘You go, Prohorovna, and put your son’s name down for\nprayer in the church, and pray for the peace of his soul as though he\nwere dead. His soul will be troubled,’ she said, ‘and he will write you\na letter.’ And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing\nwhich had been many times tried. Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light\nof ours! is it true or false, and would it be right?”\n\n“Don’t think of it. It’s shameful to ask the question. How is it\npossible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his own mother\ntoo! It’s a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is\nforgiven you. Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and\nhelp, for his good health, and that she may forgive you for your error.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, Prohorovna. Either he will soon come\nback to you, your son, or he will be sure to send a letter. Go, and\nhenceforward be in peace. Your son is alive, I tell you.”\n\n“Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us\nand for our sins!”",
            "6": "But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed\nupon him. An exhausted, consumptive‐looking, though young peasant woman\nwas gazing at him in silence. Her eyes besought him, but she seemed\nafraid to approach.\n\n“What is it, my child?”\n\n“Absolve my soul, Father,” she articulated softly, and slowly sank on\nher knees and bowed down at his feet. “I have sinned, Father. I am\nafraid of my sin.”\n\nThe elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him,\nstill on her knees.\n\n“I am a widow these three years,” she began in a half‐whisper, with a\nsort of shudder. “I had a hard life with my husband. He was an old man.\nHe used to beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought looking at him, if he\nwere to get well, if he were to get up again, what then? And then the\nthought came to me—”\n\n“Stay!” said the elder, and he put his ear close to her lips.\n\nThe woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to\ncatch anything. She had soon done.\n\n“Three years ago?” asked the elder.\n\n“Three years. At first I didn’t think about it, but now I’ve begun to\nbe ill, and the thought never leaves me.”\n\n“Have you come from far?”\n\n“Over three hundred miles away.”\n\n“Have you told it in confession?”\n\n“I have confessed it. Twice I have confessed it.”\n\n“Have you been admitted to Communion?”\n\n“Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid to die.”",
            "7": "“Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don’t fret. If only your\npenitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and there\ncan be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not forgive to the\ntruly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the\ninfinite love of God. Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of\nGod? Think only of repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear\naltogether. Believe that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He\nloves you with your sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over\none repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten\nrighteous men. Go, and fear not. Be not bitter against men. Be not\nangry if you are wronged. Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong\nhe did you. Be reconciled with him in truth. If you are penitent, you\nlove. And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all\nthings are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender\nwith you and have pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a\npriceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and\nexpiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.”\n\nHe signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a\nlittle ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without\nspeaking.\n\nHe got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny\nbaby in her arms.\n\n“From Vyshegorye, dear Father.”\n\n“Five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?”\n\n“I’ve come to look at you. I have been to you before—or have you\nforgotten? You’ve no great memory if you’ve forgotten me. They told us\nyou were ill. Thinks I, I’ll go and see him for myself. Now I see you,\nand you’re not ill! You’ll live another twenty years. God bless you!\nThere are plenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?”\n\n“I thank you for all, daughter.”\n\n“By the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty\ncopecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought\nas I came along, better give through him. He’ll know whom to give to.”\n\n“Thanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do\nso certainly. Is that your little girl?”\n\n“My little girl, Father, Lizaveta.”\n\n“May the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta! You have\ngladdened my heart, mother. Farewell, dear children, farewell, dear\nones.”\n\nHe blessed them all and bowed low to them."

She was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good\ndisposition in many respects. When the elder went up to her at last she\nmet him enthusiastically.\n\n“Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...”\nShe could not go on for emotion. “Oh, I understand the people’s love\nfor you. I love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could\nhelp loving them, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their\ngreatness!”\n\n“How is your daughter’s health?

We have come, great healer, to express our ardent\ngratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely by\npraying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We have\nhastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our\nhomage.”\n\n“What do you mean by healed? But she is still lying down in her chair.”\n\n“But her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,” said\nthe lady with nervous haste. “And that’s not all. Her legs are\nstronger. This morning she got up well; she had slept all night. Look\nat her rosy cheeks, her bright eyes! She used to be always crying, but\nnow she laughs and is gay and happy. This morning she insisted on my\nletting her stand up, and she stood up for a whole minute without any\nsupport. She wagers that in a fortnight she’ll be dancing a quadrille.\nI’ve called in Doctor Herzenstube. He shrugged his shoulders and said,\n‘I am amazed; I can make nothing of it.’ And would you have us not come\nhere to disturb you, not fly here to thank you? Lise, thank him—thank\nhim!”\n\nLise’s pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. She rose in\nher chair as far as she could and, looking at the elder, clasped her\nhands before him, but could not restrain herself and broke into\nlaughter.\n\n“It’s at him,” she said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation at\nherself for not being able to repress her mirth.\n\nIf any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, he\nwould have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant.\nHis eyes shone and he looked down.\n\n“She has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you?” the\nmother went on, holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.",
            "1": "The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha.\nThe latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way,\nheld out his hand to her too. Lise assumed an important air.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.” She handed him a\nlittle note. “She particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as\npossible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.”\n\n“She asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?” Alyosha muttered in\ngreat astonishment. His face at once looked anxious. “Oh, it’s all to\ndo with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and—what has happened lately,” the mother\nexplained hurriedly. “Katerina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she\nmust see you about it.... Why, of course, I can’t say. But she wants to\nsee you at once. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian\nduty.”\n\n“I have only seen her once,” Alyosha protested with the same\nperplexity.\n\n“Oh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her\nsuffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring\nnow! Think what awaits her! It’s all terrible, terrible!”\n\n“Very well, I will come,” Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the\nbrief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he\nwould come, without any sort of explanation.\n\n“Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!” cried Lise with\nsudden animation. “I told mamma you’d be sure not to go. I said you\nwere saving your soul. How splendid you are! I’ve always thought you\nwere splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!”\n\n“Lise!” said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had\nsaid it.\n\n“You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said; “you\nnever come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never\nhappy except with you.”\n\nAlyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled\nwithout knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He had\nbegun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his\nentrance by Lise’s chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that\nis of the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer,\nand, in his own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from\nthe far north, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of\na poor monastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his\nblessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked.",
            "2": "“How can you presume to do such deeds?” the monk asked suddenly,\npointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her\n“healing.”\n\n“It’s too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete\ncure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any\nhealing, it is by no power but God’s will. It’s all from God. Visit me,\nFather,” he added to the monk. “It’s not often I can see visitors. I am\nill, and I know that my days are numbered.”\n\n“Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, long\ntime yet,” cried the lady. “And in what way are you ill? You look so\nwell, so gay and happy.”\n\n“I am extraordinarily better to‐day. But I know that it’s only for a\nmoment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to\nyou, you could never say anything that would please me so much. For men\nare made for happiness, and any one who is completely happy has a right\nto say to himself, ‘I am doing God’s will on earth.’ All the righteous,\nall the saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.”\n\n“Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!” cried the lady. “You\nseem to pierce with your words. And yet—happiness, happiness—where is\nit? Who can say of himself that he is happy? Oh, since you have been so\ngood as to let us see you once more to‐day, let me tell you what I\ncould not utter last time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and\nhave been for so long! I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering!”\n\nAnd in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him.\n\n“From what specially?”\n\n“I suffer ... from lack of faith.”\n\n“Lack of faith in God?”\n\n“Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that. But the future life—it is\nsuch an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! You are a\nhealer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare\nnot expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of\nhonor that I am not speaking lightly now. The thought of the life\nbeyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to terror. And I don’t know\nto whom to appeal, and have not dared to all my life. And now I am so\nbold as to ask you. Oh, God! What will you think of me now?”\n\nShe clasped her hands.\n\n“Don’t distress yourself about my opinion of you,” said the elder. “I\nquite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.”",
            "3": "“Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself\nif every one has faith, where did it come from? And then they do say\nthat it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and\nthat none of it’s real. And I say to myself, ‘What if I’ve been\nbelieving all my life, and when I come to die there’s nothing but the\nburdocks growing on my grave?’ as I read in some author. It’s awful!\nHow—how can I get back my faith? But I only believed when I was a\nlittle child, mechanically, without thinking of anything. How, how is\none to prove it? I have come now to lay my soul before you and to ask\nyou about it. If I let this chance slip, no one all my life will answer\nme. How can I prove it? How can I convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I\nam! I stand and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares;\nno one troubles his head about it, and I’m the only one who can’t stand\nit. It’s deadly—deadly!”\n\n“No doubt. But there’s no proving it, though you can be convinced of\nit.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor\nactively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will\ngrow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul.\nIf you attain to perfect self‐forgetfulness in the love of your\nneighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can\npossibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.”\n\n“In active love? There’s another question—and such a question! You see,\nI so love humanity that—would you believe it?—I often dream of\nforsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of\nmercy. I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that moment I feel\nfull of strength to overcome all obstacles. No wounds, no festering\nsores could at that moment frighten me. I would bind them up and wash\nthem with my own hands. I would nurse the afflicted. I would be ready\nto kiss such wounds.”\n\n“It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not\nothers. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.”",
            "4": "“Yes. But could I endure such a life for long?” the lady went on\nfervently, almost frantically. “That’s the chief question—that’s my\nmost agonizing question. I shut my eyes and ask myself, ‘Would you\npersevere long on that path? And if the patient whose wounds you are\nwashing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried you with his\nwhims, without valuing or remarking your charitable services, began\nabusing you and rudely commanding you, and complaining to the superior\nauthorities of you (which often happens when people are in great\nsuffering)—what then? Would you persevere in your love, or not?’ And do\nyou know, I came with horror to the conclusion that, if anything could\ndissipate my love to humanity, it would be ingratitude. In short, I am\na hired servant, I expect my payment at once—that is, praise, and the\nrepayment of love with love. Otherwise I am incapable of loving any\none.”\n\nShe was in a very paroxysm of self‐castigation, and, concluding, she\nlooked with defiant resolution at the elder.\n\n“It’s just the same story as a doctor once told me,” observed the\nelder. “He was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever. He\nspoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. ‘I love\nhumanity,’ he said, ‘but I wonder at myself. The more I love humanity\nin general, the less I love man in particular. In my dreams,’ he said,\n‘I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of\nhumanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced crucifixion if it had\nbeen suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable of living in the same\nroom with any one for two days together, as I know by experience. As\nsoon as any one is near me, his personality disturbs my\nself‐complacency and restricts my freedom. In twenty‐four hours I begin\nto hate the best of men: one because he’s too long over his dinner;\nanother because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become\nhostile to people the moment they come close to me. But it has always\nhappened that the more I detest men individually the more ardent\nbecomes my love for humanity.’ ”\n\n“But what’s to be done? What can one do in such a case? Must one\ndespair?”",
            "5": "“No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and\nit will be reckoned unto you. Much is done already in you since you can\nso deeply and sincerely know yourself. If you have been talking to me\nso sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did\nfrom me just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in the\nachievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and\nyour whole life will slip away like a phantom. In that case you will\nnaturally cease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself\ngrow calmer after a fashion in the end.”\n\n“You have crushed me! Only now, as you speak, I understand that I was\nreally only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you I\ncould not endure ingratitude. You have revealed me to myself. You have\nseen through me and explained me to myself!”\n\n“Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I\nbelieve that you are sincere and good at heart. If you do not attain\nhappiness, always remember that you are on the right road, and try not\nto leave it. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood,\nespecially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and\nlook into it every hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to\nothers and to yourself. What seems to you bad within you will grow\npurer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear,\ntoo, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood.\nNever be frightened at your own faint‐heartedness in attaining love.\nDon’t be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions. I am sorry I\ncan say nothing more consoling to you, for love in action is a harsh\nand dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is\ngreedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all.\nMen will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long\nbut is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the\nstage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too,\nperhaps, a complete science. But I predict that just when you see with\nhorror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther from\nyour goal instead of nearer to it—at that very moment I predict that\nyou will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord\nwho has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you. Forgive\nme for not being able to stay longer with you. They are waiting for me.\nGood‐by.”\n\nThe lady was weeping.",
            "6": "“Lise, Lise! Bless her—bless her!” she cried, starting up suddenly.\n\n“She does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her naughtiness all\nalong,” the elder said jestingly. “Why have you been laughing at\nAlexey?”\n\nLise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time. She had\nnoticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her, and\nshe found this extremely amusing. She waited intently to catch his eye.\nAlyosha, unable to endure her persistent stare, was irresistibly and\nsuddenly drawn to glance at her, and at once she smiled triumphantly in\nhis face. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed. At last he\nturned away from her altogether and hid behind the elder’s back. After\na few minutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he turned again to\nsee whether he was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost\nhanging out of her chair to peep sideways at him, eagerly waiting for\nhim to look. Catching his eye, she laughed so that the elder could not\nhelp saying, “Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?”\n\nLise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed. Her eyes flashed and her\nface became quite serious. She began speaking quickly and nervously in\na warm and resentful voice:\n\n“Why has he forgotten everything, then? He used to carry me about when\nI was little. We used to play together. He used to come to teach me to\nread, do you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he\nwould never forget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for\never! And now he’s afraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him? Why\ndoesn’t he want to come near me? Why doesn’t he talk? Why won’t he come\nand see us? It’s not that you won’t let him. We know that he goes\neverywhere. It’s not good manners for me to invite him. He ought to\nhave thought of it first, if he hasn’t forgotten me. No, now he’s\nsaving his soul! Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs\nhe’ll fall.”\n\nAnd suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into\nirresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder\nlistened to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed\nhis hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying.\n\n“Don’t be angry with me. I’m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps\nAlyosha’s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a\nridiculous girl.”\n\n“I will certainly send him,” said the elder."

            "0": "The elder’s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty‐five\nminutes. It was more than half‐past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose\naccount they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed\nalmost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he\nfound his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks\ntook the leading share in it. Miüsov, too, was trying to take a part,\nand apparently very eagerly, in the conversation. But he was\nunsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the background, and his\nremarks were treated with neglect, which increased his irritability. He\nhad had intellectual encounters with Ivan before and he could not\nendure a certain carelessness Ivan showed him.\n\n“Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is\nprogressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores\nus,” he thought.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his word to sit still and be quiet,\nhad actually been quiet for some time, but he watched his neighbor\nMiüsov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his\ndiscomfiture. He had been waiting for some time to pay off old scores,\nand now he could not let the opportunity slip. Bending over his\nshoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper.\n\n“Why didn’t you go away just now, after the ‘courteously kissing’? Why\ndid you consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you\nfelt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by\nshowing off your intelligence. Now you won’t go till you’ve displayed\nyour intellect to them.”\n\n“You again?... On the contrary, I’m just going.”\n\n“You’ll be the last, the last of all to go!” Fyodor Pavlovitch\ndelivered him another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossima’s\nreturn.\n\nThe discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself\nin his former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting\nthem to go on. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his face, saw that\nhe was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort. Of late he had\nbeen liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His face had the pallor\nthat was common before such attacks, and his lips were white. But he\nevidently did not want to break up the party. He seemed to have some\nspecial object of his own in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched\nhim intently.",
            "1": "“We are discussing this gentleman’s most interesting article,” said\nFather Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.\n“He brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both\nways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical\nauthority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of\nits jurisdiction.”\n\n“I’m sorry I have not read your article, but I’ve heard of it,” said\nthe elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.\n\n“He takes up a most interesting position,” continued the Father\nLibrarian. “As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently\nquite opposed to the separation of Church from State.”\n\n“That’s interesting. But in what sense?” Father Zossima asked Ivan.\n\nThe latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had\nfeared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and\napparently without the slightest _arrière‐pensée_.\n\n“I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of\nthe essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on\nfor ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to\nmingle, and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any\nconsistent or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very\nfoundation of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such\nquestions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking,\nimpossible in any real sense. My clerical opponent maintains that the\nChurch holds a precise and defined position in the State. I maintain,\non the contrary, that the Church ought to include the whole State, and\nnot simply to occupy a corner in it, and, if this is, for some reason,\nimpossible at present, then it ought, in reality, to be set up as the\ndirect and chief aim of the future development of Christian society!”\n\n“Perfectly true,” Father Païssy, the silent and learned monk, assented\nwith fervor and decision.\n\n“The purest Ultramontanism!” cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing and\nrecrossing his legs.",
            "2": "“Oh, well, we have no mountains,” cried Father Iosif, and turning to\nthe elder he continued: “Observe the answer he makes to the following\n‘fundamental and essential’ propositions of his opponent, who is, you\nmust note, an ecclesiastic. First, that ‘no social organization can or\nought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political\nrights of its members.’ Secondly, that ‘criminal and civil jurisdiction\nought not to belong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature,\nboth as a divine institution and as an organization of men for\nreligious objects,’ and, finally, in the third place, ‘the Church is a\nkingdom not of this world.’ ”\n\n“A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!” Father Païssy\ncould not refrain from breaking in again. “I have read the book which\nyou have answered,” he added, addressing Ivan, “and was astounded at\nthe words ‘the Church is a kingdom not of this world.’ If it is not of\nthis world, then it cannot exist on earth at all. In the Gospel, the\nwords ‘not of this world’ are not used in that sense. To play with such\nwords is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church\nupon earth. The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but\nin Heaven; but it is only entered through the Church which has been\nfounded and established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words\nin such a connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in\ntruth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly\nbecome the kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the\ndivine promise.”\n\nHe ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After\nlistening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the\nelder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality:",
            "3": "“The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first\nthree centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and\nwas nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to\nbecome Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian,\nit included the Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its\ndepartments. In reality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State\nretained too much of the pagan civilization and culture, as, for\nexample, in the very objects and fundamental principles of the State.\nThe Christian Church entering into the State could, of course,\nsurrender no part of its fundamental principles—the rock on which it\nstands—and could pursue no other aims than those which have been\nordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them that of drawing\nthe whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the\nChurch. In that way (that is, with a view to the future) it is not the\nChurch that should seek a definite position in the State, like ‘every\nsocial organization,’ or as ‘an organization of men for religious\npurposes’ (as my opponent calls the Church), but, on the contrary,\nevery earthly State should be, in the end, completely transformed into\nthe Church and should become nothing else but a Church, rejecting every\npurpose incongruous with the aims of the Church. All this will not\ndegrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great\nState, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a\nfalse, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path,\nwhich alone leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the\nbook _On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged\ncorrectly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations, he had\nlooked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and\nimperfect days. But as soon as the author ventures to declare that the\nfoundations which he predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just\nenumerated, are the permanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he\nis going directly against the Church and its sacred and eternal\nvocation. That is the gist of my article.”",
            "4": "“That is, in brief,” Father Païssy began again, laying stress on each\nword, “according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the\nnineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State,\nas though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as\nto disappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the\nage, and civilization. And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some\ncorner will be set apart for her in the State, and even that under\ncontrol—and this will be so everywhere in all modern European\ncountries. But Russian hopes and conceptions demand not that the Church\nshould pass as from a lower into a higher type into the State, but, on\nthe contrary, that the State should end by being worthy to become only\nthe Church and nothing else. So be it! So be it!”\n\n“Well, I confess you’ve reassured me somewhat,” Miüsov said smiling,\nagain crossing his legs. “So far as I understand, then, the realization\nof such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ.\nThat’s as you please. It’s a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition\nof war, diplomacy, banks, and so on—something after the fashion of\nsocialism, indeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and\nthat the Church might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence\nthem to beating, prison, and even death.”\n\n“But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would\nnot even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the\nway of regarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course,\nbut fairly soon,” Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.\n\n“Are you serious?” Miüsov glanced keenly at him.",
            "5": "“If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the\ncriminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,” Ivan went\non. “I ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut off\nthen not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he would\nhave transgressed not only against men but against the Church of\nChrist. This is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is\nnot clearly enunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to‐day\ncompromises with his conscience: ‘I steal,’ he says, ‘but I don’t go\nagainst the Church. I’m not an enemy of Christ.’ That’s what the\ncriminal of to‐day is continually saying to himself, but when the\nChurch takes the place of the State it will be difficult for him, in\nopposition to the Church all over the world, to say: ‘All men are\nmistaken, all in error, all mankind are the false Church. I, a thief\nand murderer, am the only true Christian Church.’ It will be very\ndifficult to say this to himself; it requires a rare combination of\nunusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, take the Church’s own\nview of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present almost pagan\nattitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted\nmember for the preservation of society, as at present, into completely\nand honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man, of his\nreformation and salvation?”\n\n“What do you mean? I fail to understand again,” Miüsov interrupted.\n“Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even\nincomprehensible. What is excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I\nsuspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,” said the elder suddenly,\nand all turned to him at once. “If it were not for the Church of Christ\nthere would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil‐doing, no\nreal chastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical\npunishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only\nembitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual\none, the only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the\nrecognition of sin by conscience.”\n\n“How is that, may one inquire?” asked Miüsov, with lively curiosity.",
            "6": "“Why,” began the elder, “all these sentences to exile with hard labor,\nand formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what’s more, deter\nhardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish\nbut is continually on the increase. You must admit that. Consequently\nthe security of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious\nmember is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another\ncriminal always comes to take his place at once, and often two of them.\nIf anything does preserve society, even in our time, and does\nregenerate and transform the criminal, it is only the law of Christ\nspeaking in his conscience. It is only by recognizing his wrong‐doing\nas a son of a Christian society—that is, of the Church—that he\nrecognizes his sin against society—that is, against the Church. So that\nit is only against the Church, and not against the State, that the\ncriminal of to‐day can recognize that he has sinned. If society, as a\nChurch, had jurisdiction, then it would know when to bring back from\nexclusion and to reunite to itself. Now the Church having no real\njurisdiction, but only the power of moral condemnation, withdraws of\nher own accord from punishing the criminal actively. She does not\nexcommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of him.\nWhat is more, the Church even tries to preserve all Christian communion\nwith the criminal. She admits him to church services, to the holy\nsacrament, gives him alms, and treats him more as a captive than as a\nconvict. And what would become of the criminal, O Lord, if even the\nChristian society—that is, the Church—were to reject him even as the\ncivil law rejects him and cuts him off? What would become of him if the\nChurch punished him with her excommunication as the direct consequence\nof the secular law? There could be no more terrible despair, at least\nfor a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still have faith. Though,\nwho knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the\ndespairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what\nwould become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother,\nholds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too\nseverely punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least\nsome one to have pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all,\nbecause its judgment is the only one that contains the truth, and\ntherefore cannot practically and morally be united to any other\njudgment even as a temporary compromise. She can enter into no compact\nabout that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the\nvery doctrines of to‐day confirm him in the idea that his crime is not\na crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force.\nSociety cuts him off completely by a force that triumphs over him\nmechanically and (so at least they say of themselves in Europe)\naccompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness, and the most\nprofound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring brother. In\nthis way, it all takes place without the compassionate intervention of\nthe Church, for in many cases there are no churches there at all, for\nthough ecclesiastics and splendid church buildings remain, the churches\nthemselves have long ago striven to pass from Church into State and to\ndisappear in it completely. So it seems at least in Lutheran countries.\nAs for Rome, it was proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand\nyears ago. And so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member\nof the Church and sinks into despair. If he returns to society, often\nit is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off.\nYou can judge for yourself how it must end. In many cases it would seem\nto be the same with us, but the difference is that besides the\nestablished law courts we have the Church too, which always keeps up\nrelations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son. And\nbesides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought, the\njudgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice is\nstill living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively\nrecognized by the criminal in his soul. What was said here just now is\ntrue too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were\nintroduced in practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the\nsociety were changed into the Church, not only the judgment of the\nChurch would have influence on the reformation of the criminal such as\nit never has now, but possibly also the crimes themselves would be\nincredibly diminished. And there can be no doubt that the Church would\nlook upon the criminal and the crime of the future in many cases quite\ndifferently and would succeed in restoring the excluded, in restraining\nthose who plan evil, and in regenerating the fallen. It is true,” said\nFather Zossima, with a smile, “the Christian society now is not ready\nand is only resting on some seven righteous men, but as they are never\nlacking, it will continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete\ntransformation from a society almost heathen in character into a single\nuniversal and all‐powerful Church. So be it, so be it! Even though at\nthe end of the ages, for it is ordained to come to pass! And there is\nno need to be troubled about times and seasons, for the secret of the\ntimes and seasons is in the wisdom of God, in His foresight, and His\nlove. And what in human reckoning seems still afar off, may by the\nDivine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve of its appearance. And so\nbe it, so be it!”",
            "7": "“So be it, so be it!” Father Païssy repeated austerely and reverently.\n\n“Strange, extremely strange!” Miüsov pronounced, not so much with heat\nas with latent indignation.\n\n“What strikes you as so strange?” Father Iosif inquired cautiously.\n\n“Why, it’s beyond anything!” cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking out; “the\nState is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the\nState. It’s not simply Ultramontanism, it’s arch‐Ultramontanism! It’s\nbeyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!”\n\n“You are completely misunderstanding it,” said Father Païssy sternly.\n“Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State. That\nis Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. On\nthe contrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and\nbecome a Church over the whole world—which is the complete opposite of\nUltramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the\nglorious destiny ordained for the Orthodox Church. This star will arise\nin the east!”\n\nMiüsov was significantly silent. His whole figure expressed\nextraordinary personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile\nplayed on his lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart. The\nwhole conversation stirred him profoundly. He glanced casually at\nRakitin, who was standing immovable in his place by the door listening\nand watching intently though with downcast eyes. But from the color in\nhis cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited,\nand he knew what caused his excitement.",
            "8": "“Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,” Miüsov said\nimpressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. “Some years ago, soon\nafter the _coup d’état_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris\non an extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a\nvery interesting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a\ndetective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of\npolitical detectives—a rather powerful position in its own way. I was\nprompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with\nhim. And as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official\nbringing a special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his\nchief, he deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent\nonly, of course. He was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know\nhow to be courteous, especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly\nunderstood him. The subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were\nat that time persecuted. I will quote only one most curious remark\ndropped by this person. ‘We are not particularly afraid,’ said he, ‘of\nall these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep\nwatch on them and know all their goings on. But there are a few\npeculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at\nthe same time are socialists. These are the people we are most afraid\nof. They are dreadful people! The socialist who is a Christian is more\nto be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.’ The words struck me\nat the time, and now they have suddenly come back to me here,\ngentlemen.”\n\n“You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?” Father Païssy\nasked directly, without beating about the bush.\n\nBut before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the door\nopened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in.\nThey had, in fact, given up expecting him, and his sudden appearance\ncaused some surprise for a moment."

        "content": {
            "0": "Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height\nand agreeable countenance, looked older than his years. He was\nmuscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there\nwas something not healthy in his face. It was rather thin, his cheeks\nwere hollow, and there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color. His\nrather large, prominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm\ndetermination, and yet there was a vague look in them, too. Even when\nhe was excited and talking irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow\nhis mood, but betrayed something else, sometimes quite incongruous with\nwhat was passing. “It’s hard to tell what he’s thinking,” those who\ntalked to him sometimes declared. People who saw something pensive and\nsullen in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh, which bore\nwitness to mirthful and light‐ hearted thoughts at the very time when\nhis eyes were so gloomy. A certain strained look in his face was easy\nto understand at this moment. Every one knew, or had heard of, the\nextremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading of\nlate, as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused in\nhis quarrels with his father. There were several stories current in the\ntown about it. It is true that he was irascible by nature, “of an\nunstable and unbalanced mind,” as our justice of the peace,\nKatchalnikov, happily described him.\n\nHe was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned\nfrock‐ coat. He wore black gloves and carried a top‐hat. Having only\nlately left the army, he still had mustaches and no beard. His dark\nbrown hair was cropped short, and combed forward on his temples. He had\nthe long, determined stride of a military man. He stood still for a\nmoment on the threshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight\nup to the elder, guessing him to be their host. He made him a low bow,\nand asked his blessing. Father Zossima, rising in his chair, blessed\nhim. Dmitri kissed his hand respectfully, and with intense feeling,\nalmost anger, he said:\n\n“Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long,\nbut Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my\ninquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one. Now I\nsuddenly learn—”\n\n“Don’t disturb yourself,” interposed the elder. “No matter. You are a\nlittle late. It’s of no consequence....”\n\n“I’m extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your\ngoodness.”",
            "1": "Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards his\nfather, made him, too, a similarly low and respectful bow. He had\nevidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all\nseriousness, thinking it his duty to show his respect and good\nintentions.\n\nAlthough Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he was equal to the\noccasion. In response to Dmitri’s bow he jumped up from his chair and\nmade his son a bow as low in return. His face was suddenly solemn and\nimpressive, which gave him a positively malignant look. Dmitri bowed\ngenerally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with\nhis long, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near\nFather Païssy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the\nconversation he had interrupted.\n\nDmitri’s entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the\nconversation was resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary\nto reply to Father Païssy’s persistent and almost irritable question.\n\n“Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,” he observed with a certain\nwell‐bred nonchalance. “It’s a subtle question, too. Here Ivan\nFyodorovitch is smiling at us. He must have something interesting to\nsay about that also. Ask him.”\n\n“Nothing special, except one little remark,” Ivan replied at once.\n“European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often\nmix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity. This\nwild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. But it’s not only\nLiberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in\nmany cases, it appears, the police—the foreign police, of course—do the\nsame. Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch.”",
            "2": "“I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,” Miüsov\nrepeated. “I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and\nrather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself. Only five\ndays ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he solemnly\ndeclared in argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make\nmen love their neighbors. That there was no law of nature that man\nshould love mankind, and that, if there had been any love on earth\nhitherto, it was not owing to a natural law, but simply because men\nhave believed in immortality. Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis\nthat the whole natural law lies in that faith, and that if you were to\ndestroy in mankind the belief in immortality, not only love but every\nliving force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried\nup. Moreover, nothing then would be immoral, everything would be\nlawful, even cannibalism. That’s not all. He ended by asserting that\nfor every individual, like ourselves, who does not believe in God or\nimmortality, the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into\nthe exact contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even\nto crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized as the\ninevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his position.\nFrom this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our\neccentric and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch’s theories.”\n\n“Excuse me,” Dmitri cried suddenly; “if I’ve heard aright, crime must\nnot only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the\nmost rational outcome of his position for every infidel! Is that so or\nnot?”\n\n“Quite so,” said Father Païssy.\n\n“I’ll remember it.”\n\nHaving uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he had\nbegun. Every one looked at him with curiosity.\n\n“Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the\ndisappearance of the faith in immortality?” the elder asked Ivan\nsuddenly.\n\n“Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no\nimmortality.”\n\n“You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.”\n\n“Why unhappy?” Ivan asked smiling.\n\n“Because, in all probability you don’t believe yourself in the\nimmortality of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your\narticle on Church jurisdiction.”\n\n“Perhaps you are right! ... But I wasn’t altogether joking,” Ivan\nsuddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly.",
            "3": "“You were not altogether joking. That’s true. The question is still\nfretting your heart, and not answered. But the martyr likes sometimes\nto divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair\nitself. Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself with\nmagazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don’t believe\nyour own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....\nThat question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it\nclamors for an answer.”\n\n“But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative?” Ivan went\non asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same\ninexplicable smile.\n\n“If it can’t be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided in\nthe negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and\nall its suffering is due to it. But thank the Creator who has given you\na lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higher\nthings, for our dwelling is in the heavens. God grant that your heart\nwill attain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path.”\n\nThe elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross\nover Ivan from where he stood. But the latter rose from his seat, went\nup to him, received his blessing, and kissing his hand went back to his\nplace in silence. His face looked firm and earnest. This action and all\nthe preceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan,\nimpressed every one by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that\nall were silent for a moment, and there was a look almost of\napprehension in Alyosha’s face. But Miüsov suddenly shrugged his\nshoulders. And at the same moment Fyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his\nseat.\n\n“Most pious and holy elder,” he cried, pointing to Ivan, “that is my\nson, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh! He is my most dutiful\nKarl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri,\nagainst whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz\nMoor—they are both out of Schiller’s _Robbers_, and so I am the\nreigning Count von Moor! Judge and save us! We need not only your\nprayers but your prophecies!”\n\n“Speak without buffoonery, and don’t begin by insulting the members of\nyour family,” answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He was\nobviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing.",
            "4": "“An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!” cried Dmitri\nindignantly. He too leapt up. “Forgive it, reverend Father,” he added,\naddressing the elder. “I am not a cultivated man, and I don’t even know\nhow to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have\nbeen too good‐natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is a\nscandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive.\nBut I believe I know why—”",
            "5": "“They all blame me, all of them!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn.\n“Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me,\nPyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!” he turned suddenly to Miüsov, although\nthe latter was not dreaming of interrupting him. “They all accuse me of\nhaving hidden the children’s money in my boots, and cheated them, but\nisn’t there a court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, from your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how\nmuch money you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have\nleft. Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is\nnot a stranger to him. Because they are all against me, while Dmitri\nFyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some thousands of\nwhich I have documentary proof. The whole town is echoing with his\ndebaucheries. And where he was stationed before, he several times spent\na thousand or two for the seduction of some respectable girl; we know\nall about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its most secret details. I’ll\nprove it.... Would you believe it, holy Father, he has captivated the\nheart of the most honorable of young ladies of good family and fortune,\ndaughter of a gallant colonel, formerly his superior officer, who had\nreceived many honors and had the Anna Order on his breast. He\ncompromised the girl by his promise of marriage, now she is an orphan\nand here; she is betrothed to him, yet before her very eyes he is\ndancing attendance on a certain enchantress. And although this\nenchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriage with a\nrespectable man, yet she is of an independent character, an\nunapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wife—for she\nis virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she is virtuous. Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nwants to open this fortress with a golden key, and that’s why he is\ninsolent to me now, trying to get money from me, though he has wasted\nthousands on this enchantress already. He’s continually borrowing money\nfor the purpose. From whom do you think? Shall I say, Mitya?”\n\n“Be silent!” cried Dmitri, “wait till I’m gone. Don’t dare in my\npresence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl! That you should\nutter a word about her is an outrage, and I won’t permit it!”\n\nHe was breathless.\n\n“Mitya! Mitya!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a\ntear. “And is your father’s blessing nothing to you? If I curse you,\nwhat then?”\n\n“Shameless hypocrite!” exclaimed Dmitri furiously.",
            "6": "“He says that to his father! his father! What would he be with others?\nGentlemen, only fancy; there’s a poor but honorable man living here,\nburdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and was\ndischarged from the army, but not publicly, not by court‐martial, with\nno slur on his honor. And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him by the\nbeard in a tavern, dragged him out into the street and beat him\npublicly, and all because he is an agent in a little business of mine.”\n\n“It’s all a lie! Outwardly it’s the truth, but inwardly a lie!” Dmitri\nwas trembling with rage. “Father, I don’t justify my action. Yes, I\nconfess it publicly, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I\nregret it now, and I’m disgusted with myself for my brutal rage. But\nthis captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom you call an\nenchantress, and suggested to her from you, that she should take\nI.O.U.’s of mine which were in your possession, and should sue me for\nthe money so as to get me into prison by means of them, if I persisted\nin claiming an account from you of my property. Now you reproach me for\nhaving a weakness for that lady when you yourself incited her to\ncaptivate me! She told me so to my face.... She told me the story and\nlaughed at you.... You wanted to put me in prison because you are\njealous of me with her, because you’d begun to force your attentions\nupon her; and I know all about that, too; she laughed at you for that\nas well—you hear—she laughed at you as she described it. So here you\nhave this man, this father who reproaches his profligate son!\nGentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man\nwould only bring you together to create a scandal. I had come to\nforgive him if he held out his hand; to forgive him, and ask\nforgiveness! But as he has just this minute insulted not only me, but\nan honorable young lady, for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not\ntake her name in vain, I have made up my mind to show up his game,\nthough he is my father....”",
            "7": "He could not go on. His eyes were glittering and he breathed with\ndifficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred. All except Father\nZossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere but\nwaited for guidance from the elder. He sat still, pale, not from\nexcitement but from the weakness of disease. An imploring smile lighted\nup his face; from time to time he raised his hand, as though to check\nthe storm, and, of course, a gesture from him would have been enough to\nend the scene; but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched\nthem intently as though trying to make out something which was not\nperfectly clear to him. At last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and\ndisgraced.\n\n“We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,” he said hotly. “But I\ndid not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal.\nThis must be stopped at once! Believe me, your reverence, I had no\nprecise knowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was\nunwilling to believe them, and I learn for the first time.... A father\nis jealous of his son’s relations with a woman of loose behavior and\nintrigues with the creature to get his son into prison! This is the\ncompany in which I have been forced to be present! I was deceived. I\ndeclare to you all that I was as much deceived as any one.”\n\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an\nunnatural voice, “if you were not my son I would challenge you this\ninstant to a duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a\nhandkerchief,” he ended, stamping with both feet.\n\nWith old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments\nwhen they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed\ntears of emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second\nlater, they are able to whisper to themselves, “You know you are lying,\nyou shameless old sinner! You’re acting now, in spite of your ‘holy’\nwrath.”\n\nDmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at his\nfather.\n\n“I thought ... I thought,” he said, in a soft and, as it were,\ncontrolled voice, “that I was coming to my native place with the angel\nof my heart, my betrothed, to cherish his old age, and I find nothing\nbut a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!”",
            "8": "“A duel!” yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at\neach syllable. “And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me tell you\nthat there has never been in all your family a loftier, and more\nhonest—you hear—more honest woman than this ‘creature,’ as you have\ndared to call her! And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your\nbetrothed for that ‘creature,’ so you must yourself have thought that\nyour betrothed couldn’t hold a candle to her. That’s the woman called a\n‘creature’!”\n\n“Shameful!” broke from Father Iosif.\n\n“Shameful and disgraceful!” Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a\nboyish voice, trembling with emotion. He had been silent till that\nmoment.\n\n“Why is such a man alive?” Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in\na hollow voice, hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost\ndeformed. “Tell me, can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth?” He\nlooked round at every one and pointed at the old man. He spoke evenly\nand deliberately.\n\n“Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nrushing up to Father Iosif. “That’s the answer to your ‘shameful!’ What\nis shameful? That ‘creature,’ that ‘woman of loose behavior’ is perhaps\nholier than you are yourselves, you monks who are seeking salvation!\nShe fell perhaps in her youth, ruined by her environment. But she loved\nmuch, and Christ himself forgave the woman ‘who loved much.’ ”\n\n“It was not for such love Christ forgave her,” broke impatiently from\nthe gentle Father Iosif.\n\n“Yes, it was for such, monks, it was! You save your souls here, eating\ncabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and\nyou think you bribe God with gudgeon.”\n\n“This is unendurable!” was heard on all sides in the cell.\n\nBut this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way. Father\nZossima rose suddenly from his seat. Almost distracted with anxiety for\nthe elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supporting\nhim by the arm. Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him\nsank on his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from\nweakness, but this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately\nbowed down at Dmitri’s feet till his forehead touched the floor.\nAlyosha was so astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up\nagain. There was a faint smile on his lips.\n\n“Good‐by! Forgive me, all of you!” he said, bowing on all sides to his\nguests.",
            "9": "Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him—what\ndid it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, “Oh, God!” hid his face in his\nhands, and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after\nhim, in their confusion not saying good‐by, or bowing to their host.\nOnly the monks went up to him again for a blessing.\n\n“What did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic or\nwhat?” said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen\nconversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They\nwere all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.\n\n“I can’t answer for a madhouse and for madmen,” Miüsov answered at once\nill‐humoredly, “but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor\nPavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where’s that monk?”\n\n“That monk,” that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with the\nSuperior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came\ndown the steps from the elder’s cell, as though he had been waiting for\nthem all the time.\n\n“Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. Convey my deepest respect to\nthe Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov, to his\nreverence, telling him that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen\ncircumstances I am unable to have the honor of being present at his\ntable, greatly as I should desire to do so,” Miüsov said irritably to\nthe monk.\n\n“And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,” Fyodor\nPavlovitch cut in immediately. “Do you hear, Father; this gentleman\ndoesn’t want to remain in my company or else he’d come at once. And you\nshall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and good\nappetite to you. I will decline, and not you. Home, home, I’ll eat at\nhome, I don’t feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable\nrelative.”\n\n“I am not your relative and never have been, you contemptible man!”\n\n“I said it on purpose to madden you, because you always disclaim the\nrelationship, though you really are a relation in spite of your\nshuffling. I’ll prove it by the church calendar. As for you, Ivan, stay\nif you like. I’ll send the horses for you later. Propriety requires you\nto go to the Father Superior, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to apologize for\nthe disturbance we’ve been making....”\n\n“Is it true that you are going home? Aren’t you lying?”",
            "10": "“Pyotr Alexandrovitch! How could I dare after what’s happened! Forgive\nme, gentlemen, I was carried away! And upset besides! And, indeed, I am\nashamed. Gentlemen, one man has the heart of Alexander of Macedon and\nanother the heart of the little dog Fido. Mine is that of the little\ndog Fido. I am ashamed! After such an escapade how can I go to dinner,\nto gobble up the monastery’s sauces? I am ashamed, I can’t. You must\nexcuse me!”\n\n“The devil only knows, what if he deceives us?” thought Miüsov, still\nhesitating, and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eyes.\nThe latter turned round, and noticing that Miüsov was watching him,\nwaved him a kiss.\n\n“Well, are you coming to the Superior?” Miüsov asked Ivan abruptly.\n\n“Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.”\n\n“Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded\ndinner,” said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact\nthat the monk was listening. “We ought, at least, to apologize for the\ndisturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What do you think?”\n\n“Yes, we must explain that it wasn’t our doing. Besides, father won’t\nbe there,” observed Ivan.\n\n“Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!”\n\nThey all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On the road\nthrough the copse he made one observation however—that the Father\nSuperior had been waiting a long time, and that they were more than\nhalf an hour late. He received no answer. Miüsov looked with hatred at\nIvan.\n\n“Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,” he\nthought. “A brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!”"

            "0": "Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed.\nIt was a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a\nnarrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress. In the\ncorner, under the ikons, was a reading‐desk with a cross and the Gospel\nlying on it. The elder sank exhausted on the bed. His eyes glittered\nand he breathed hard. He looked intently at Alyosha, as though\nconsidering something.\n\n“Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are\nneeded there, go and wait at the Father Superior’s table.”\n\n“Let me stay here,” Alyosha entreated.\n\n“You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and\nbe of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember,\nmy son”—the elder liked to call him that—“this is not the place for you\nin the future. When it is God’s will to call me, leave the monastery.\nGo away for good.”\n\nAlyosha started.\n\n“What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great\nservice in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will\nhave to take a wife, too. You will have to bear _all_ before you come\nback. There will be much to do. But I don’t doubt of you, and so I send\nyou forth. Christ is with you. Do not abandon Him and He will not\nabandon you. You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be\nhappy. This is my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work,\nwork unceasingly. Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you\nagain, not only my days but my hours are numbered.”\n\nAlyosha’s face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his mouth\nquivered.\n\n“What is it again?” Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. “The worldly\nmay follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who\nis departing. We rejoice and pray for him. Leave me, I must pray. Go,\nand make haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near\nboth.”\n\nFather Zossima raised his hand to bless him. Alyosha could make no\nprotest, though he had a great longing to remain. He longed, moreover,\nto ask the significance of his bowing to Dmitri, the question was on\nthe tip of his tongue, but he dared not ask it. He knew that the elder\nwould have explained it unasked if he had thought fit. But evidently it\nwas not his will. That action had made a terrible impression on\nAlyosha; he believed blindly in its mysterious significance.\nMysterious, and perhaps awful.",
            "1": "As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in\ntime to serve at the Father Superior’s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at\nhis heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima’s\nwords, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly\nmust infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how\ncould he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and\nhearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to\nleave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such\nanguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from\nthe hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed\nat the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go—about five\nhundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the\nfirst turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one.\n\n“Are you waiting for me?” asked Alyosha, overtaking him.\n\n“Yes,” grinned Rakitin. “You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I\nknow; he has a banquet. There’s not been such a banquet since the\nSuperior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I\nshan’t be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing,\nAlexey, what does that vision mean? That’s what I want to ask you.”\n\n“What vision?”\n\n“That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn’t he tap the ground with\nhis forehead, too!”\n\n“You speak of Father Zossima?”\n\n“Yes, of Father Zossima.”\n\n“Tapped the ground?”\n\n“Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that\nvision mean?”\n\n“I don’t know what it means, Misha.”\n\n“I knew he wouldn’t explain it to you! There’s nothing wonderful about\nit, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in\nthe performance. All the pious people in the town will talk about it\nand spread the story through the province, wondering what it meant. To\nmy thinking the old man really has a keen nose; he sniffed a crime.\nYour house stinks of it.”\n\n“What crime?”\n\nRakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of.",
            "2": "“It’ll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your\nrich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what\nmay turn up. If something happens later on, it’ll be: ‘Ah, the holy man\nforesaw it, prophesied it!’ though it’s a poor sort of prophecy,\nflopping like that. ‘Ah, but it was symbolic,’ they’ll say, ‘an\nallegory,’ and the devil knows what all! It’ll be remembered to his\nglory: ‘He predicted the crime and marked the criminal!’ That’s always\nthe way with these crazy fanatics; they cross themselves at the tavern\nand throw stones at the temple. Like your elder, he takes a stick to a\njust man and falls at the feet of a murderer.”\n\n“What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?”\n\nAlyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.\n\n“What murderer? As though you didn’t know! I’ll bet you’ve thought of\nit before. That’s interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you\nalways speak the truth, though you’re always between two stools. Have\nyou thought of it or not? Answer.”\n\n“I have,” answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken\naback.\n\n“What? Have you really?” he cried.\n\n“I ... I’ve not exactly thought it,” muttered Alyosha, “but directly\nyou began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought of it myself.”\n\n“You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your father and\nyour brother Mitya to‐day you thought of a crime. Then I’m not\nmistaken?”\n\n“But wait, wait a minute,” Alyosha broke in uneasily. “What has led you\nto see all this? Why does it interest you? That’s the first question.”\n\n“Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I’ll deal with them\nseparately. What led me to see it? I shouldn’t have seen it, if I\nhadn’t suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the\nvery heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one trait.\nThese very honest but passionate people have a line which mustn’t be\ncrossed. If it were, he’d run at your father with a knife. But your\nfather’s a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who can never draw the\nline—if they both let themselves go, they’ll both come to grief.”\n\n“No, Misha, no. If that’s all, you’ve reassured me. It won’t come to\nthat.”",
            "3": "“But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest, our\nMitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he’s—a sensualist. That’s the\nvery definition and inner essence of him. It’s your father has handed\nhim on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you,\nAlyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You’re a Karamazov too, you\nknow! In your family sensuality is carried to a disease. But now, these\nthree sensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their\nbelts. The three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may\nbe the fourth.”\n\n“You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri—despises her,” said Alyosha,\nwith a sort of shudder.\n\n“Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn’t despise her. Since he has openly\nabandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn’t despise her. There’s\nsomething here, my dear boy, that you don’t understand yet. A man will\nfall in love with some beauty, with a woman’s body, or even with a part\nof a woman’s body (a sensualist can understand that), and he’ll abandon\nhis own children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country,\nRussia, too. If he’s honest, he’ll steal; if he’s humane, he’ll murder;\nif he’s faithful, he’ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women’s feet,\nsung of their feet in his verse. Others don’t sing their praises, but\nthey can’t look at their feet without a thrill—and it’s not only their\nfeet. Contempt’s no help here, brother, even if he did despise\nGrushenka. He does, but he can’t tear himself away.”\n\n“I understand that,” Alyosha jerked out suddenly.",
            "4": "“Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at\nthe first word,” said Rakitin, malignantly. “That escaped you unawares,\nand the confession’s the more precious. So it’s a familiar subject;\nyou’ve thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you\nvirgin soul! You’re a quiet one, Alyosha, you’re a saint, I know, but\nthe devil only knows what you’ve thought about, and what you know\nalready! You are pure, but you’ve been down into the depths.... I’ve\nbeen watching you a long time. You’re a Karamazov yourself; you’re a\nthorough Karamazov—no doubt birth and selection have something to\nanswer for. You’re a sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from\nyour mother. Why do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know,\nGrushenka has been begging me to bring you along. ‘I’ll pull off his\ncassock,’ she says. You can’t think how she keeps begging me to bring\nyou. I wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know,\nshe’s an extraordinary woman, too!”\n\n“Thank her and say I’m not coming,” said Alyosha, with a strained\nsmile. “Finish what you were saying, Misha. I’ll tell you my idea\nafter.”",
            "5": "“There’s nothing to finish. It’s all clear. It’s the same old tune,\nbrother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,\nIvan? He’s a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you Karamazovs\nis that you’re all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your brother Ivan\nwrites theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive\nof his own, though he’s an atheist, and he admits it’s a fraud\nhimself—that’s your brother Ivan. He’s trying to get Mitya’s betrothed\nfor himself, and I fancy he’ll succeed, too. And what’s more, it’s with\nMitya’s consent. For Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be\nrid of her, and escape to Grushenka. And he’s ready to do that in spite\nof all his nobility and disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the\nmost fatal people! Who the devil can make you out? He recognizes his\nvileness and goes on with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your\nfather, is standing in Mitya’s way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over\nGrushenka. His mouth waters at the sight of her. It’s simply on her\naccount he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Miüsov\ncalled her an ‘abandoned creature.’ He’s worse than a tom‐cat in love.\nAt first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns\nand in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly realized all\nshe is and has gone wild about her. He keeps pestering her with his\noffers, not honorable ones, of course. And they’ll come into collision,\nthe precious father and son, on that path! But Grushenka favors neither\nof them, she’s still playing with them, and teasing them both,\nconsidering which she can get most out of. For though she could filch a\nlot of money from the papa he wouldn’t marry her, and maybe he’ll turn\nstingy in the end, and keep his purse shut. That’s where Mitya’s value\ncomes in; he has no money, but he’s ready to marry her. Yes, ready to\nmarry her! to abandon his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna,\nwho’s rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who\nhas been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse,\nuneducated, provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well come to\npass from all this, and that’s what your brother Ivan is waiting for.\nIt would suit him down to the ground. He’ll carry off Katerina\nIvanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of sixty\nthousand. That’s very alluring to start with, for a man of no\nconsequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won’t be wronging Mitya,\nbut doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya\nonly last week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern,\ncried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that\nhis brother Ivan, he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina\nIvanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan.\nShe’s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan\nwon you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and\nenjoying himself at your expense.”",
            "6": "“How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?” Alyosha asked\nsharply, frowning.\n\n“Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you\nknow I’m speaking the truth.”\n\n“You don’t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn’t be tempted by money.”\n\n“Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It’s not only the money,\nthough a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.”\n\n“Ivan is above that. He wouldn’t make up to any one for thousands. It\nis not money, it’s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it’s suffering\nhe is seeking.”\n\n“What wild dream now? Oh, you—aristocrats!”\n\n“Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is\nhaunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who don’t want\nmillions, but an answer to their questions.”\n\n“That’s plagiarism, Alyosha. You’re quoting your elder’s phrases. Ah,\nIvan has set you a problem!” cried Rakitin, with undisguised malice.\nHis face changed, and his lips twitched. “And the problem’s a stupid\none. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains—you’ll understand it.\nHis article is absurd and ridiculous. And did you hear his stupid\ntheory just now: if there’s no immortality of the soul, then there’s no\nvirtue, and everything is lawful. (And by the way, do you remember how\nyour brother Mitya cried out: ‘I will remember!’) An attractive theory\nfor scoundrels!—(I’m being abusive, that’s stupid.) Not for scoundrels,\nbut for pedantic _poseurs_, ‘haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.’\nHe’s showing off, and what it all comes to is, ‘on the one hand we\ncannot but admit’ and ‘on the other it must be confessed!’ His whole\ntheory is a fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for\nvirtue even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love\nfor freedom, for equality, for fraternity.”\n\nRakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as\nthough remembering something, he stopped short.\n\n“Well, that’s enough,” he said, with a still more crooked smile. “Why\nare you laughing? Do you think I’m a vulgar fool?”\n\n“No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are clever but\n... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your getting hot\nabout it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent\nto Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I’ve suspected that for a long time,\nbrother, that’s why you don’t like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of\nhim?”\n\n“And jealous of her money, too? Won’t you add that?”\n\n“I’ll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.”",
            "7": "“I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother\nIvan with you. Don’t you understand that one might very well dislike\nhim, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him?\nHe condescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven’t I a right to abuse\nhim?”\n\n“I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad. He\ndoesn’t speak of you at all.”\n\n“But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna’s he\nwas abusing me for all he was worth—you see what an interest he takes\nin your humble servant. And which is the jealous one after that,\nbrother, I can’t say. He was so good as to express the opinion that, if\nI don’t go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate\nfuture and don’t become a monk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and\nget on to some solid magazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the\nnext ten years, and in the end become the owner of the magazine, and\nbring it out on the liberal and atheistic side, with a socialistic\ntinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping a sharp look out all\nthe time, that is, keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the\nfools. According to your brother’s account, the tinge of socialism\nwon’t hinder me from laying by the proceeds and investing them under\nthe guidance of some Jew, till at the end of my career I build a great\nhouse in Petersburg and move my publishing offices to it, and let out\nthe upper stories to lodgers. He has even chosen the place for it, near\nthe new stone bridge across the Neva, which they say is to be built in\nPetersburg.”\n\n“Ah, Misha, that’s just what will really happen, every word of it,”\ncried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good‐humored smile.\n\n“You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“No, no, I’m joking, forgive me. I’ve something quite different in my\nmind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You can’t have\nbeen at Katerina Ivanovna’s yourself when he was talking about you?”\n\n“I wasn’t there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him tell it\nwith my own ears; if you want to know, he didn’t tell me, but I\noverheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in\nGrushenka’s bedroom and I couldn’t go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nwas in the next room.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I’d forgotten she was a relation of yours.”\n\n“A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!” cried Rakitin, turning\ncrimson. “Are you mad? You’re out of your mind!”\n\n“Why, isn’t she a relation of yours? I heard so.”",
            "8": "“Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient,\nnoble family, though your father used to run about playing the buffoon\nat other men’s tables, and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor.\nI may be only a priest’s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like\nyou, but don’t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of\nhonor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn’t be a relation of Grushenka,\na common harlot. I beg you to understand that!”\n\nRakitin was intensely irritated.\n\n“Forgive me, for goodness’ sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can\nyou call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?” Alyosha flushed\nsuddenly. “I tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours.\nYou often go to see her, and you told me yourself you’re not her lover.\nI never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does\nshe really deserve it?”\n\n“I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That’s not your\nbusiness. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,\nis more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You’d\nbetter go to the kitchen. Hullo! what’s wrong, what is it? Are we late?\nThey can’t have finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been\nmaking trouble again? No doubt they have. Here’s your father and your\nbrother Ivan after him. They’ve broken out from the Father Superior’s.\nAnd look, Father Isidor’s shouting out something after them from the\nsteps. And your father’s shouting and waving his arms. I expect he’s\nswearing. Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage. You\nsee, he’s going. And there’s old Maximov running!—there must have been\na row. There can’t have been any dinner. Surely they’ve not been\nbeating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been beaten? It\nwould serve them right!”\n\nThere was reason for Rakitin’s exclamations. There had been a\nscandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of\na moment."

            "0": "Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some\ninward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior’s with Ivan: he felt\nashamed of having lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have\ndisdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have\nbeen upset by him in Father Zossima’s cell, and so to have forgotten\nhimself. “The monks were not to blame, in any case,” he reflected, on\nthe steps. “And if they’re decent people here (and the Father Superior,\nI understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with\nthem? I won’t argue, I’ll fall in with everything, I’ll win them by\npoliteness, and ... and ... show them that I’ve nothing to do with that\nÆsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over\nthis affair, just as they have.”\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish\nhis claims to the wood‐cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the\nmore ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable,\nand he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question\nwere.",
            "1": "These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father\nSuperior’s dining‐room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a dining‐\nroom, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they were,\nhowever, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima’s. But\nthere was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either.\nThe furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the\nold‐fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but\neverything was shining with cleanliness, and there were many choice\nflowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the\nmoment was, of course, the beautifully decorated table. The cloth was\nclean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well‐baked bread,\ntwo bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of\nkvas—both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the\nneighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there\nwere five dishes: fish‐soup made of sterlets, served with little fish\npatties; then boiled fish served in a special way; then salmon cutlets,\nice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc‐mange. Rakitin found out\nabout all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the\nkitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere,\nand got information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious\ntemper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and\nnervously exaggerated them in his self‐conceit. He knew he would play a\nprominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to him, was\ndistressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and quite\nunconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that\nbecause he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the\nhighest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have\ninfluenced him in that.",
            "2": "Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be\ninvited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one\nother monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were\nalready waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other\nguest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior\nstepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a\ntall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streaked with\ngray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in\nsilence. But this time they approached to receive his blessing. Miüsov\neven tried to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in\ntime to avoid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the\nceremony in the most simple‐hearted and complete manner, kissing his\nhand as peasants do.\n\n“We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,” began Miüsov,\nsimpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.\n“Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,\nFyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your\nhospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father Zossima’s\ncell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his son, and\nlet fall words which were quite out of keeping ... in fact, quite\nunseemly ... as”—he glanced at the monks—“your reverence is, no doubt,\nalready aware. And therefore, recognizing that he had been to blame, he\nfelt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan\nFyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologies and regrets. In brief, he\nhopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessing, and begs\nyou to forget what has taken place.”\n\nAs he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered\nhis self‐complacency, and all traces of his former irritation\ndisappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with dignity, and, with a slight\nbend of the head, replied:\n\n“I sincerely deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have\nlearnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.”\n\nHe stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent\ntheir heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with\npeculiar fervor.",
            "3": "It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It\nmust be noted that he really had meant to go home, and really had felt\nthe impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though\nnothing had happened, after his disgraceful behavior in the elder’s\ncell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself—quite the\ncontrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to\ndinner. Yet his creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps\nof the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped\nshort. He remembered his own words at the elder’s: “I always feel when\nI meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a\nbuffoon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of\nyou, stupider and lower than I.” He longed to revenge himself on every\none for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in\nthe past been asked, “Why do you hate so and so, so much?” And he had\nanswered them, with his shameless impudence, “I’ll tell you. He has\ndone me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have\nhated him.”\n\nRemembering that now, he smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for\na moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered. “Well,\nsince I have begun, I may as well go on,” he decided. His predominant\nsensation at that moment might be expressed in the following words,\n“Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for\nall I am worth. I will show them I don’t care what they think—that’s\nall!”\n\nHe told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he returned to the\nmonastery and straight to the Father Superior’s. He had no clear idea\nwhat he would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and\nthat a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity, but\nonly to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he could be\nlegally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself,\nand had marveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He\nappeared in the Father Superior’s dining‐room, at the moment when the\nprayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the\ndoorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent,\nmalicious chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. “They thought I\nhad gone, and here I am again,” he cried to the whole room.",
            "4": "For one moment every one stared at him without a word; and at once\nevery one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively\nscandalous, was about to happen. Miüsov passed immediately from the\nmost benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that\nhad subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n“No! this I cannot endure!” he cried. “I absolutely cannot! and ... I\ncertainly cannot!”\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was\nbeyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n“What is it he cannot?” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, “that he absolutely\ncannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not?\nWill you receive me as your guest?”\n\n“You are welcome with all my heart,” answered the Superior.\n“Gentlemen!” he added, “I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay\naside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family\nharmony—with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.”\n\n“No, no, it is impossible!” cried Miüsov, beside himself.\n\n“Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible\nfor me, and I won’t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr\nAlexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You\nstung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he\ndoes not admit he is my relation. That’s right, isn’t it, von Sohn?\nHere’s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?”\n\n“Do you mean me?” muttered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n“Of course I mean you,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “Who else? The Father\nSuperior could not be von Sohn.”\n\n“But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.”\n\n“No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It\nwas a famous murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry—I\nbelieve that is what such places are called among you—he was killed and\nrobbed, and in spite of his venerable age, he was nailed up in a box\nand sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they\nwere nailing him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that\nis to say, the piano. So this is that very von Sohn. He has risen from\nthe dead, hasn’t he, von Sohn?”\n\n“What is happening? What’s this?” voices were heard in the group of\nmonks.\n\n“Let us go,” cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.",
            "5": "“No, excuse me,” Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another\nstep into the room. “Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed\nme for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon,\nPyotr Alexandrovitch. Miüsov, my relation, prefers to have _plus de\nnoblesse que de sincérité_ in his words, but I prefer in mine _plus de\nsincérité que de noblesse_, and—damn the _noblesse_! That’s right,\nisn’t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon\nand play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak\nmy mind. Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch\nthere is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a\nlook and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his\nfather; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I’ve\nbeen playing the fool, I have been listening and having a look on the\nsly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performance. You\nknow how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing\nonce has fallen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to\nget up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Confession is a\ngreat sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but\nthere in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud. Can it be\nright to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess\nin secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was\nof old. But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this\nand that ... well, you understand what—sometimes it would not be proper\nto talk about it—so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be\ncarried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first\nopportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son,\nAlexey, home.”",
            "6": "We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the\nweak spot. There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even\nreached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others\nwhere the institution of elders existed) that too much respect was paid\nto the elders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior,\nthat the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so\non—absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the\nspirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing\nhim on the current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of\nignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not\nunderstand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on\nthis occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the\nelder’s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He\nwas only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as\nhe had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd\nnonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audience, and above all to\nhimself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew\nperfectly well that with each word he would be adding more and more\nabsurdity, he could not restrain himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n“How disgraceful!” cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n“Pardon me!” said the Father Superior. “It was said of old, ‘Many have\nbegun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And\nhearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and\nHe has sent it to heal my vain soul.’ And so we humbly thank you,\nhonored guest!” and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.",
            "7": "“Tut—tut—tut—sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old\ngestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them.\nA kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller’s\n_Robbers_. I don’t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the\ntruth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud!\nFather monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for\nthat? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly\nmonk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without\nshutting yourself up in a monastery at other people’s expense, and\nwithout expecting a reward up aloft for it—you’ll find that a bit\nharder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got\nhere?” He went up to the table. “Old port wine, mead brewed by the\nEliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon.\nLook at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has\nprovided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the\nfarthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the\ntax‐gatherer! You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.”\n\n“This is too disgraceful!” said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Païssy kept obstinately silent. Miüsov rushed from the room, and\nKalganov after him.\n\n“Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to\nsee you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan’t come. I sent you\na thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he!\nNo, I’ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the\nhumiliation I endured.” He thumped the table with his fist in a\nparoxysm of simulated feeling. “This monastery has played a great part\nin my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife,\nthe crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread\nstories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age\nof Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand,\nnor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of\nme!”\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great\npart in his life, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But\nhe was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one\nmoment almost believing it himself. He was so touched he was almost\nweeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw\nback.",
            "8": "The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again\nspoke impressively:\n\n“It is written again, ‘Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that\ncometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not\nhim who hath dishonored thee.’ And so will we.”\n\n“Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.\nBethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey,\naway from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch,\nmy most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn,\nwhat have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun\nthere. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give\nyou sucking‐pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brandy and\nliqueur to it.... I’ve cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don’t lose your\nchance.” He went out, shouting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n“Alexey!” his father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him. “You\ncome home to me to‐day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress,\nand leave no trace behind.”\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence.\nMeanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was\nabout to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good‐by\nto Alyosha. But at this point another almost incredible scene of\ngrotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode. Maximov\nsuddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting,\nafraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running. He was\nin such a hurry that in his impatience he put his foot on the step on\nwhich Ivan’s left foot was still resting, and clutching the carriage he\nkept trying to jump in. “I am going with you!” he kept shouting,\nlaughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his\nface. “Take me, too.”\n\n“There!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. “Did I not say he was von\nSohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you\ntear yourself away? What did you _vonsohn_ there? And how could you get\naway from the dinner? You must be a brazen‐faced fellow! I am that\nmyself, but I am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him\npass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you\nlie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip\non to the box, von Sohn!”",
            "9": "But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a\nviolent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chance\nhe did not fall.\n\n“Drive on!” Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman.\n\n“Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?”\nFyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n“Well, you are a fellow,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.\n\nAfter a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, “Why, it was\nyou got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of\nit. Why are you angry now?”\n\n“You’ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,” Ivan snapped\nsullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n“A drop of brandy would be nice now,” he observed sententiously, but\nIvan made no response.\n\n“You shall have some, too, when we get home.”\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.\n\n“But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will\ndislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.”\n\nIvan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at\nthe road. And they did not speak again all the way home.\n\n\n\n\nBook III. The Sensualists"

            "0": "The Karamazovs’ house was far from being in the center of the town, but\nit was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant‐looking old house of two\nstories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was roomy and snug, and\nmight still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little\ncupboards and closets and staircases. There were rats in it, but Fyodor\nPavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. “One doesn’t feel so\nsolitary when one’s left alone in the evening,” he used to say. It was\nhis habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to\nlock himself up alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the\nyard. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although\nthere was a kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of cooking,\nand, winter and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the\ncourtyard. The house was built for a large family; there was room for\nfive times as many, with their servants. But at the time of our story\nthere was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son\nIvan. And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory, and\nhis old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov. Of these three\nwe must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said something already.\nHe was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his\nobject, if once he had been brought by any reasons (and they were often\nvery illogical ones) to believe that it was immutably right. He was\nhonest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her\nhusband’s will implicitly all her life, yet she had pestered him\nterribly after the emancipation of the serfs. She was set on leaving\nFyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small\nsavings. But Grigory decided then, once for all, that “the woman’s\ntalking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,” and that they ought\nnot to leave their old master, whatever he might be, for “that was now\ntheir duty.”\n\n“Do you understand what duty is?” he asked Marfa Ignatyevna.\n\n“I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it’s our\nduty to stay here I never shall understand,” Marfa answered firmly.\n\n“Well, don’t understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your\ntongue.”",
            "1": "And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised\nthem a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly. Grigory knew, too,\nthat he had an indisputable influence over his master. It was true, and\nhe was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning\nbuffoon, yet, though his will was strong enough “in some of the affairs\nof life,” as he expressed it, he found himself, to his surprise,\nextremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies. He knew his\nweaknesses and was afraid of them. There are positions in which one has\nto keep a sharp look out. And that’s not easy without a trustworthy\nman, and Grigory was a most trustworthy man. Many times in the course\nof his life Fyodor Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing\nthrough Grigory’s intervention, and on each occasion the old servant\ngave him a good lecture. But it wasn’t only thrashings that Fyodor\nPavlovitch was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle\nand complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained\nthe extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted, which\nsometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a moment. It was almost a\nmorbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his lust, like some\nnoxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in moments of\ndrunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion\nwhich took an almost physical form. “My soul’s simply quaking in my\nthroat at those times,” he used to say. At such moments he liked to\nfeel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a\nstrong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his\ndebauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to\noverlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or\nthreaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and,\nin case of need, to defend him—from whom? From somebody unknown, but\nterrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was\n_another_ man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him in his\nsick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some\nquite irrelevant words with him. And if the old servant were not angry,\nhe felt comforted, and if he were angry, he was more dejected. It\nhappened even (very rarely however) that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at\nnight to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him for a moment. When the\nold man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin talking about the most\ntrivial matters, and would soon let him go again, sometimes even with a\njest. And after he had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with\na curse and sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had\nhappened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha’s arrival. Alyosha “pierced\nhis heart” by “living with him, seeing everything and blaming nothing.”\nMoreover, Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known\nbefore: a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable\nkindness, a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who\ndeserved it so little. All this was a complete surprise to the old\nprofligate, who had dropped all family ties. It was a new and\nsurprising experience for him, who had till then loved nothing but\n“evil.” When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to himself that he had\nlearnt something he had not till then been willing to learn.",
            "2": "I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaïda Ivanovna,\nthe first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that\nhe had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor “crazy\nwoman,” against his master and any one who chanced to speak ill or\nlightly of her. His sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something\nsacred to him, so that even now, twenty years after, he could not bear\na slighting allusion to her from any one, and would at once check the\noffender. Externally, Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and\nspoke, weighing his words, without frivolity. It was impossible to tell\nat first sight whether he loved his meek, obedient wife; but he really\ndid love her, and she knew it.\n\nMarfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she was probably, indeed,\ncleverer than her husband, or, at least, more prudent than he in\nworldly affairs, and yet she had given in to him in everything without\nquestion or complaint ever since her marriage, and respected him for\nhis spiritual superiority. It was remarkable how little they spoke to\none another in the course of their lives, and only of the most\nnecessary daily affairs. The grave and dignified Grigory thought over\nall his cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown\nused to knowing that he did not need her advice. She felt that her\nhusband respected her silence, and took it as a sign of her good sense.\nHe had never beaten her but once, and then only slightly. Once during\nthe year after Fyodor Pavlovitch’s marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, the\nvillage girls and women—at that time serfs—were called together before\nthe house to sing and dance. They were beginning “In the Green\nMeadows,” when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and\ndanced “the Russian Dance,” not in the village fashion, but as she had\ndanced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich Miüsov\nfamily, in their private theater, where the actors were taught to dance\nby a dancing master from Moscow. Grigory saw how his wife danced, and,\nan hour later, at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson, pulling\nher hair a little. But there it ended: the beating was never repeated,\nand Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.",
            "3": "God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died.\nGrigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it. When\nAdelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of\nthree years old, combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own\nhands, and looked after him for almost a year. Afterwards he had looked\nafter Ivan and Alyosha, for which the general’s widow had rewarded him\nwith a slap in the face; but I have already related all that. The only\nhappiness his own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of\nits birth. When it was born, he was overwhelmed with grief and horror.\nThe baby had six fingers. Grigory was so crushed by this, that he was\nnot only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the\ngarden. It was spring, and he spent three days digging the kitchen\ngarden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean‐time\nGrigory had reached a conclusion. Going into the cottage where the\nclergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including Fyodor\nPavlovitch, who was to stand god‐ father, he suddenly announced that\nthe baby “ought not to be christened at all.” He announced this\nquietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing with dull\nintentness at the priest.\n\n“Why not?” asked the priest with good‐humored surprise.\n\n“Because it’s a dragon,” muttered Grigory.\n\n“A dragon? What dragon?”\n\nGrigory did not speak for some time. “It’s a confusion of nature,” he\nmuttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more.",
            "4": "They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby. Grigory prayed\nearnestly at the font, but his opinion of the new‐born child remained\nunchanged. Yet he did not interfere in any way. As long as the sickly\ninfant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it,\nand for the most part kept out of the cottage. But when, at the end of\na fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he himself laid the child in its\nlittle coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were\nfilling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down\nto the earth. He did not for years afterwards mention his child, nor\ndid Marfa speak of the baby before him, and, even if Grigory were not\npresent, she never spoke of it above a whisper. Marfa observed that,\nfrom the day of the burial, he devoted himself to “religion,” and took\nto reading the _Lives of the Saints_, for the most part sitting alone\nand in silence, and always putting on his big, round, silver‐rimmed\nspectacles. He rarely read aloud, only perhaps in Lent. He was fond of\nthe Book of Job, and had somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and\nsermons of “the God‐fearing Father Isaac the Syrian,” which he read\npersistently for years together, understanding very little of it, but\nperhaps prizing and loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun\nto listen to the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the\nneighborhood. He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting\nto go over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him\nan expression of still greater gravity.",
            "5": "He was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. And the birth of his deformed\nchild, and its death, had, as though by special design, been\naccompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which, as he said\nlater, had left a “stamp” upon his soul. It happened that, on the very\nnight after the burial of his child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of\na new‐born baby. She was frightened and waked her husband. He listened\nand said he thought it was more like some one groaning, “it might be a\nwoman.” He got up and dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he\nwent down the steps, he distinctly heard groans coming from the garden.\nBut the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and\nthere was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by\na strong, high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a\nlantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical\nfears of his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child\ncrying, and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went\ninto the garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came\nfrom the bath‐house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were\nthe groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath‐house, he saw a\nsight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the\nstreets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta\nSmerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath‐ house and\nhad just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside\nher. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But her\nstory needs a chapter to itself."

            "0": "There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and\nconfirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was\na dwarfish creature, “not five foot within a wee bit,” as many of the\npious old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her\nbroad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare\nin her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She\nwandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing\nbut a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb’s\nwool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted\nwith mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it,\nas she always slept on the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a\nhomeless, sickly drunkard, called Ilya, had lost everything and lived\nmany years as a workman with some well‐to‐do tradespeople. Her mother\nhad long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta\ninhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for\nevery one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot,\nand so specially dear to God. Ilya’s employers, and many others in the\ntown, especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her better, and\nalways rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the\nwinter. But, although she allowed them to dress her up without\nresisting, she usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch,\nand taking off all that had been given her—kerchief, sheepskin, skirt\nor boots—she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock as\nbefore. It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the\nprovince, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and\nwas wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was told\nshe was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to\nwander about in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties,\nand must not occur again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta\nwas left as she was. At last her father died, which made her even more\nacceptable in the eyes of the religious persons of the town, as an\norphan. In fact, every one seemed to like her; even the boys did not\ntease her, and the boys of our town, especially the schoolboys, are a\nmischievous set. She would walk into strange houses, and no one drove\nher away. Every one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were\ngiven a copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms‐jug\nof the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market,\nshe would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would stop\none of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the lady\nwould be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything but\nblack bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop, where there\nwere costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on her, for\nthey knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she\nwould not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to church.\nShe slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle (there\nare many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a\nkitchen garden. She used at least once a week to turn up “at home,”\nthat is at the house of her father’s former employers, and in the\nwinter went there every night, and slept either in the passage or the\ncowhouse. People were amazed that she could stand such a life, but she\nwas accustomed to it, and, although she was so tiny, she was of a\nrobust constitution. Some of the townspeople declared that she did all\nthis only from pride, but that is hardly credible. She could hardly\nspeak, and only from time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How\ncould she have been proud?",
            "1": "It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years\nago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a\nvery late hour, according to our provincial notions. They passed\nthrough the “back‐ way,” which led between the back gardens of the\nhouses, with hurdles on either side. This way leads out on to the\nbridge over the long, stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a\nriver. Among the nettles and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw\nLizaveta asleep. They stopped to look at her, laughing, and began\njesting with unbridled licentiousness. It occurred to one young\ngentleman to make the whimsical inquiry whether any one could possibly\nlook upon such an animal as a woman, and so forth.... They all\npronounced with lofty repugnance that it was impossible. But Fyodor\nPavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward and declared that it was\nby no means impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy\nabout it, and so on.... It is true that at that time he was overdoing\nhis part as a buffoon. He liked to put himself forward and entertain\nthe company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality he\nwas on a servile footing with them. It was just at the time when he had\nreceived the news of his first wife’s death in Petersburg, and, with\ncrape upon his hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly that even\nthe most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him. The\nrevelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one of\nthem even began challenging him to act upon it. The others repelled the\nidea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity,\nand at last they went on their way. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore\nthat he had gone with them, and perhaps it was so, no one knows for\ncertain, and no one ever knew. But five or six months later, all the\ntown was talking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta’s\ncondition, and trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged\nher. Then suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this\nmiscreant was no other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going?\nOf that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still\namong us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the father\nof grown‐up daughters, who could hardly have spread the tale, even if\nthere had been any foundation for it. But rumor pointed straight at\nFyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at him. Of course this was\nno great grievance to him: he would not have troubled to contradict a\nset of tradespeople. In those days he was proud, and did not condescend\nto talk except in his own circle of the officials and nobles, whom he\nentertained so well.",
            "2": "At the time, Grigory stood up for his master vigorously. He provoked\nquarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing\nsome people round to his side. “It’s the wench’s own fault,” he\nasserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had\nescaped from prison and whose name was well known to us, as he had\nhidden in our town. This conjecture sounded plausible, for it was\nremembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just at that time in\nthe autumn, and had robbed three people. But this affair and all the\ntalk about it did not estrange popular sympathy from the poor idiot.\nShe was better looked after than ever. A well‐to‐do merchant’s widow\nnamed Kondratyev arranged to take her into her house at the end of\nApril, meaning not to let her go out until after the confinement. They\nkept a constant watch over her, but in spite of their vigilance she\nescaped on the very last day, and made her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\ngarden. How, in her condition, she managed to climb over the high,\nstrong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she must have\nbeen lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny.\nThe most likely explanation is that it happened naturally—that\nLizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens,\nhad somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and\nhad leapt down, injuring herself.\n\nGrigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch\nan old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta\ndied at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his\nwife sit down, put it on her lap. “A child of God—an orphan is akin to\nall,” he said, “and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us\nthis, who has come from the devil’s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him\nand weep no more.”\n\nSo Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people\nwere not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch\ndid not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he\npersisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople\nwere pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch\ninvented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his\nmother’s nickname.",
            "3": "So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch’s second servant, and was\nliving in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story\nbegins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this\nSmerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers’ attention so long\noccupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story,\nhoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it."

            "0": "Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his\nfather shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness\nhe did not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the\nkitchen to find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set\noff, trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt\ntormenting him. I hasten to add that his father’s shouts, commanding\nhim to return home “with his mattress and pillow” did not frighten him\nin the least. He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were\nmerely “a flourish” to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman\nin our town who was celebrating his name‐day with a party of friends,\ngetting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery\nand furniture and tore his own and his wife’s clothes, and finally\nbroke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of course,\nwhen he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers. Alyosha\nknew that his father would let him go back to the monastery next day,\npossibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded that his\nfather might hurt any one else, but would not hurt him. Alyosha was\ncertain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him,\nand, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him. This was for him\nan axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he went his way\nwithout hesitation, relying on it.",
            "1": "But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and\nworried him the more because he could not formulate it. It was the fear\nof a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him in\nthe note handed to him by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her about\nsomething. This request and the necessity of going had at once aroused\nan uneasy feeling in his heart, and this feeling had grown more and\nmore painful all the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage\nand at the Father Superior’s. He was not uneasy because he did not know\nwhat she would speak of and what he must answer. And he was not afraid\nof her simply as a woman. Though he knew little of women, he had spent\nhis life, from early childhood till he entered the monastery, entirely\nwith women. He was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been\nafraid of her from the first time he saw her. He had only seen her two\nor three times, and had only chanced to say a few words to her. He\nthought of her as a beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her\nbeauty which troubled him, but something else. And the vagueness of his\napprehension increased the apprehension itself. The girl’s aims were of\nthe noblest, he knew that. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri\nsimply through generosity, though he had already behaved badly to her.\nYet, although Alyosha recognized and did justice to all these fine and\ngenerous sentiments, a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he\ndrew near her house.\n\nHe reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend,\nwith her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was\neven more certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the\nreason. And so his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great\nlonging to run and see his brother Dmitri before that fateful\ninterview. Without showing him the letter, he could talk to him about\nit. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and he was sure to be away from\nhome too. Standing still for a minute, he reached a final decision.\nCrossing himself with a rapid and accustomed gesture, and at once\nsmiling, he turned resolutely in the direction of his terrible lady.",
            "2": "He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then across the\nmarket‐place, it was a long way round. Though our town is small, it is\nscattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his father was\nexpecting him, and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command. He might\nbe unreasonable, and so he had to make haste to get there and back. So\nhe decided to take a short cut by the back‐way, for he knew every inch\nof the ground. This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and\ncrossing other people’s back‐yards, where every one he met knew him and\ngreeted him. In this way he could reach the High Street in half the\ntime.\n\nHe had to pass the garden adjoining his father’s, and belonging to a\nlittle tumbledown house with four windows. The owner of this house, as\nAlyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her daughter, who\nhad been a genteel maid‐servant in generals’ families in Petersburg.\nNow she had been at home a year, looking after her sick mother. She\nalways dressed up in fine clothes, though her old mother and she had\nsunk into such poverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\nkitchen for soup and bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though the\nyoung woman came up for soup, she had never sold any of her dresses,\nand one of these even had a long train—a fact which Alyosha had learned\nfrom Rakitin, who always knew everything that was going on in the town.\nHe had forgotten it as soon as he heard it, but now, on reaching the\ngarden, he remembered the dress with the train, raised his head, which\nhad been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite unexpected.\n\nOver the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was\nleaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him, obviously\nafraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard. Alyosha ran up to\nthe hurdle.\n\n“It’s a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,” Mitya\nsaid in a joyful, hurried whisper. “Climb in here quickly! How splendid\nthat you’ve come! I was just thinking of you!”\n\nAlyosha was delighted too, but he did not know how to get over the\nhurdle. Mitya put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump.\nTucking up his cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility\nof a bare‐ legged street urchin.\n\n“Well done! Now come along,” said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper.",
            "3": "“Where?” whispered Alyosha, looking about him and finding himself in a\ndeserted garden with no one near but themselves. The garden was small,\nbut the house was at least fifty paces away.\n\n“There’s no one here. Why do you whisper?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“Why do I whisper? Deuce take it!” cried Dmitri at the top of his\nvoice. “You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in\nsecret, and on the watch. I’ll explain later on, but, knowing it’s a\nsecret, I began whispering like a fool, when there’s no need. Let us\ngo. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you.\n\nGlory to God in the world,\nGlory to God in me ...\n\n\nI was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came.”\n\nThe garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only\nalong the fence at the four sides. There were apple‐trees, maples,\nlimes and birch‐trees. The middle of the garden was an empty grass\nspace, from which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the\nsummer. The garden was let out for a few roubles for the summer. There\nwere also plantations of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid\nout along the sides; a kitchen garden had been planted lately near the\nhouse.\n\nDmitri led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.\nThere, in a thicket of lime‐trees and old bushes of black currant,\nelder, snowball‐tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble‐down green\nsummer‐house, blackened with age. Its walls were of lattice‐work, but\nthere was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows when this\nsummer‐house was built. There was a tradition that it had been put up\nsome fifty years before by a retired colonel called von Schmidt, who\nowned the house at that time. It was all in decay, the floor was\nrotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled musty. In the\nsummer‐house there was a green wooden table fixed in the ground, and\nround it were some green benches upon which it was still possible to\nsit. Alyosha had at once observed his brother’s exhilarated condition,\nand on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of brandy and a\nwineglass on the table.\n\n“That’s brandy,” Mitya laughed. “I see your look: ‘He’s drinking\nagain!’ Distrust the apparition.\n\nDistrust the worthless, lying crowd,\nAnd lay aside thy doubts.",
            "4": "\nI’m not drinking, I’m only ‘indulging,’ as that pig, your Rakitin,\nsays. He’ll be a civil councilor one day, but he’ll always talk about\n‘indulging.’ Sit down. I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press\nyou to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world—in reality—in\nre‐al‐ i‐ty—(can you take it in?) I love no one but you!”\n\nHe uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.\n\n“No one but you and one ‘jade’ I have fallen in love with, to my ruin.\nBut being in love doesn’t mean loving. You may be in love with a woman\nand yet hate her. Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still. Sit\ndown here by the table and I’ll sit beside you and look at you, and go\non talking. You shall keep quiet and I’ll go on talking, for the time\nhas come. But on reflection, you know, I’d better speak quietly, for\nhere—here—you can never tell what ears are listening. I will explain\neverything; as they say, ‘the story will be continued.’ Why have I been\nlonging for you? Why have I been thirsting for you all these days, and\njust now? (It’s five days since I’ve cast anchor here.) Because it’s\nonly to you I can tell everything; because I must, because I need you,\nbecause to‐morrow I shall fly from the clouds, because to‐morrow life\nis ending and beginning. Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of\nfalling down a precipice into a pit? That’s just how I’m falling, but\nnot in a dream. And I’m not afraid, and don’t you be afraid. At least,\nI am afraid, but I enjoy it. It’s not enjoyment though, but ecstasy.\nDamn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish\nspirit—whatever it is! Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine, how\nclear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it’s still summer; four\no’clock in the afternoon and the stillness! Where were you going?”\n\n“I was going to father’s, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna’s\nfirst.”\n\n“To her, and to father! Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for\nyou? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and\neven in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina\nIvanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To send an\nangel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And\nhere you are on your way to see father and her.”\n\n“Did you really mean to send me?” cried Alyosha with a distressed\nexpression.\n\n“Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be\nquiet, be quiet for a time. Don’t be sorry, and don’t cry.”",
            "5": "Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead.\n\n“She’s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that’s why\nyou’re going to her? You wouldn’t be going except for that?”\n\n“Here is her note.” Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked\nthrough it quickly.\n\n“And you were going the back‐way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him\nby the back‐way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly\nold fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I\nmean to tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in\nheaven I’ve told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are\nan angel on earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that’s what\nI need, that some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people\nbreak away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at\nleast one of them, and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to\nsome one else and says, ‘Do this for me’—some favor never asked before\nthat could only be asked on one’s deathbed—would that other refuse, if\nhe were a friend or a brother?”\n\n“I will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,” said Alyosha.\n\n“Make haste! H’m!... Don’t be in a hurry, Alyosha, you hurry and worry\nyourself. There’s no need to hurry now. Now the world has taken a new\nturning. Ah, Alyosha, what a pity you can’t understand ecstasy. But\nwhat am I saying to him? As though you didn’t understand it. What an\nass I am! What am I saying? ‘Be noble, O man!’—who says that?”\n\nAlyosha made up his mind to wait. He felt that, perhaps, indeed, his\nwork lay here. Mitya sank into thought for a moment, with his elbow on\nthe table and his head in his hand. Both were silent.\n\n“Alyosha,” said Mitya, “you’re the only one who won’t laugh. I should\nlike to begin—my confession—with Schiller’s _Hymn to Joy_, _An die\nFreude_! I don’t know German, I only know it’s called that. Don’t think\nI’m talking nonsense because I’m drunk. I’m not a bit drunk. Brandy’s\nall very well, but I need two bottles to make me drunk:\n\nSilenus with his rosy phiz\nUpon his stumbling ass.\n\n\nBut I’ve not drunk a quarter of a bottle, and I’m not Silenus. I’m not\nSilenus, though I am strong,[1] for I’ve made a decision once for all.\nForgive me the pun; you’ll have to forgive me a lot more than puns\nto‐day. Don’t be uneasy. I’m not spinning it out. I’m talking sense,\nand I’ll come to the point in a minute. I won’t keep you in suspense.\nStay, how does it go?”",
            "6": "He raised his head, thought a minute, and began with enthusiasm:\n\n“Wild and fearful in his cavern\nHid the naked troglodyte,\nAnd the homeless nomad wandered\nLaying waste the fertile plain.\nMenacing with spear and arrow\nIn the woods the hunter strayed....\nWoe to all poor wretches stranded\nOn those cruel and hostile shores!\n\n“From the peak of high Olympus\nCame the mother Ceres down,\nSeeking in those savage regions\nHer lost daughter Proserpine.\nBut the Goddess found no refuge,\nFound no kindly welcome there,\nAnd no temple bearing witness\nTo the worship of the gods.\n\n“From the fields and from the vineyards\nCame no fruits to deck the feasts,\nOnly flesh of bloodstained victims\nSmoldered on the altar‐fires,\nAnd where’er the grieving goddess\nTurns her melancholy gaze,\nSunk in vilest degradation\nMan his loathsomeness displays.”\n\n\nMitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha’s hand.\n\n“My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too. There’s a\nterrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of\ntrouble. Don’t think I’m only a brute in an officer’s uniform,\nwallowing in dirt and drink. I hardly think of anything but of that\ndegraded man—if only I’m not lying. I pray God I’m not lying and\nshowing off. I think about that man because I am that man myself.\n\nWould he purge his soul from vileness\nAnd attain to light and worth,\nHe must turn and cling for ever\nTo his ancient Mother Earth.\n\n\nBut the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth. I\ndon’t kiss her. I don’t cleave to her bosom. Am I to become a peasant\nor a shepherd? I go on and I don’t know whether I’m going to shame or\nto light and joy. That’s the trouble, for everything in the world is a\nriddle! And whenever I’ve happened to sink into the vilest degradation\n(and it’s always been happening) I always read that poem about Ceres\nand man. Has it reformed me? Never! For I’m a Karamazov. For when I do\nleap into the pit, I go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be\nfalling in that degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it. And in\nthe very depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise. Let me be\naccursed. Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil\nin which my God is shrouded. Though I may be following the devil, I am\nThy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the\nworld cannot stand.",
            "7": "Joy everlasting fostereth\nThe soul of all creation,\nIt is her secret ferment fires\nThe cup of life with flame.\n’Tis at her beck the grass hath turned\nEach blade towards the light\nAnd solar systems have evolved\nFrom chaos and dark night,\nFilling the realms of boundless space\nBeyond the sage’s sight.\nAt bounteous Nature’s kindly breast,\nAll things that breathe drink Joy,\nAnd birds and beasts and creeping things\nAll follow where She leads.\nHer gifts to man are friends in need,\nThe wreath, the foaming must,\nTo angels—vision of God’s throne,\nTo insects—sensual lust.\n\n\nBut enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness\nthat every one would laugh at. But you won’t laugh. Your eyes are\nshining, too. Enough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects\nto whom God gave “sensual lust.”\n\nTo insects—sensual lust.\n\n\nI am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. All we\nKaramazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives\nin you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood. Tempests,\nbecause sensual lust is a tempest—worse than a tempest! Beauty is a\nterrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been\nfathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but\nriddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by\nside. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I’ve thought a lot about\nthis. It’s terrible what mysteries there are! Too many riddles weigh\nmen down on earth. We must solve them as we can, and try to keep a dry\nskin in the water. Beauty! I can’t endure the thought that a man of\nlofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with\nthe ideal of Sodom. What’s still more awful is that a man with the\nideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna,\nand his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just\nas in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad,\nindeed. I’d have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it!\nWhat to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart.\nIs there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of\nmankind beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful\nthing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the\ndevil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man. But a\nman always talks of his own ache. Listen, now to come to facts.”"

            "0": "“I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent\nseveral thousand roubles in seducing young girls. That’s a swinish\ninvention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I\ndidn’t need money simply for _that_. With me money is an accessory, the\noverflow of my heart, the framework. To‐day she would be my lady,\nto‐morrow a wench out of the streets in her place. I entertained them\nboth. I threw away money by the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies.\nSometimes I gave it to the ladies, too, for they’ll take it greedily,\nthat must be admitted, and be pleased and thankful for it. Ladies used\nto be fond of me: not all of them, but it happened, it happened. But I\nalways liked side‐paths, little dark back‐alleys behind the main\nroad—there one finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in\nthe dirt. I am speaking figuratively, brother. In the town I was in,\nthere were no such back‐alleys in the literal sense, but morally there\nwere. If you were like me, you’d know what that means. I loved vice, I\nloved the ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a\nnoxious insect? In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot of us,\nfor a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and I began\nsqueezing a girl’s hand, and forced her to kiss me. She was the\ndaughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature. She\nallowed me, she allowed me much in the dark. She thought, poor thing,\nthat I should come next day to make her an offer (I was looked upon as\na good match, too). But I didn’t say a word to her for five months. I\nused to see her in a corner at dances (we were always having dances),\nher eyes watching me. I saw how they glowed with fire—a fire of gentle\nindignation. This game only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my\nsoul. Five months later she married an official and left the town,\nstill angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live\nhappily. Observe that I told no one. I didn’t boast of it. Though I’m\nfull of low desires, and love what’s low, I’m not dishonorable. You’re\nblushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all\nthis was nothing much—wayside blossoms _à la_ Paul de Kock—though the\ncruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I’ve a perfect album\nof reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings. I tried to\nbreak it off without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never\nbragged of one of them. But that’s enough. You can’t suppose I brought\nyou here simply to talk of such nonsense. No, I’m going to tell you\nsomething more curious; and don’t be surprised that I’m glad to tell\nyou, instead of being ashamed.”",
            "1": "“You say that because I blushed,” Alyosha said suddenly. “I wasn’t\nblushing at what you were saying or at what you’ve done. I blushed\nbecause I am the same as you are.”\n\n“You? Come, that’s going a little too far!”\n\n“No, it’s not too far,” said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not\na new one). “The ladder’s the same. I’m at the bottom step, and you’re\nabove, somewhere about the thirteenth. That’s how I see it. But it’s\nall the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step\nis bound to go up to the top one.”\n\n“Then one ought not to step on at all.”\n\n“Any one who can help it had better not.”\n\n“But can you?”\n\n“I think not.”\n\n“Hush, Alyosha, hush, darling! I could kiss your hand, you touch me so.\nThat rogue Grushenka has an eye for men. She told me once that she’d\ndevour you one day. There, there, I won’t! From this field of\ncorruption fouled by flies, let’s pass to my tragedy, also befouled by\nflies, that is by every sort of vileness. Although the old man told\nlies about my seducing innocence, there really was something of the\nsort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and then it did not come\noff. The old man who has reproached me with what never happened does\nnot even know of this fact; I never told any one about it. You’re the\nfirst, except Ivan, of course—Ivan knows everything. He knew about it\nlong before you. But Ivan’s a tomb.”\n\n“Ivan’s a tomb?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAlyosha listened with great attention.",
            "2": "“I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under\nsupervision, like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in\nthe little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be\nrich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways\nas well. Although they shook their heads over me, they liked me. My\ncolonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike to me. He was always\ndown upon me, but I had powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town\nwas on my side, so he couldn’t do me much harm. I was in fault myself\nfor refusing to treat him with proper respect. I was proud. This\nobstinate old fellow, who was really a very good sort, kind‐hearted and\nhospitable, had had two wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a\nhumble family, left a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a\nyoung woman of four and twenty when I was there, and was living with\nher father and an aunt, her mother’s sister. The aunt was simple and\nilliterate; the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things\nabout people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than\nAgafya—fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn’t bad‐looking\neither, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full figure, and\nbeautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face. She had not married,\nalthough she had had two suitors. She refused them, but was as cheerful\nas ever. I was intimate with her, not in ‘that’ way, it was pure\nfriendship. I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I\nused to talk to her with shocking frankness, and she only laughed. Many\nwomen like such freedom, and she was a girl too, which made it very\namusing. Another thing, one could never think of her as a young lady.\nShe and her aunt lived in her father’s house with a sort of voluntary\nhumility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people. She\nwas a general favorite, and of use to every one, for she was a clever\ndressmaker. She had a talent for it. She gave her services freely\nwithout asking for payment, but if any one offered her payment, she\ndidn’t refuse. The colonel, of course, was a very different matter. He\nwas one of the chief personages in the district. He kept open house,\nentertained the whole town, gave suppers and dances. At the time I\narrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the\nexpected return of the colonel’s second daughter, a great beauty, who\nhad just left a fashionable school in the capital. This second daughter\nis Katerina Ivanovna, and she was the child of the second wife, who\nbelonged to a distinguished general’s family; although, as I learnt on\ngood authority, she too brought the colonel no money. She had\nconnections, and that was all. There may have been expectations, but\nthey had come to nothing.",
            "3": "“Yet, when the young lady came from boarding‐school on a visit, the\nwhole town revived. Our most distinguished ladies—two ‘Excellencies’\nand a colonel’s wife—and all the rest following their lead, at once\ntook her up and gave entertainments in her honor. She was the belle of\nthe balls and picnics, and they got up _tableaux vivants_ in aid of\ndistressed governesses. I took no notice, I went on as wildly as\nbefore, and one of my exploits at the time set all the town talking. I\nsaw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the battery commander’s,\nbut I didn’t go up to her, as though I disdained her acquaintance. I\ndid go up and speak to her at an evening party not long after. She\nscarcely looked at me, and compressed her lips scornfully. ‘Wait a bit.\nI’ll have my revenge,’ thought I. I behaved like an awful fool on many\noccasions at that time, and I was conscious of it myself. What made it\nworse was that I felt that ‘Katenka’ was not an innocent\nboarding‐school miss, but a person of character, proud and really\nhigh‐principled; above all, she had education and intellect, and I had\nneither. You think I meant to make her an offer? No, I simply wanted to\nrevenge myself, because I was such a hero and she didn’t seem to feel\nit.\n\n“Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the\nlieutenant‐colonel put me under arrest for three days. Just at that\ntime father sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a\ndeed giving up all claims upon him—settling our accounts, so to speak,\nand saying that I wouldn’t expect anything more. I didn’t understand a\nword of it at the time. Until I came here, Alyosha, till the last few\ndays, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven’t been able to make head or\ntail of my money affairs with father. But never mind that, we’ll talk\nof it later.",
            "4": "“Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me\nsomething that interested me immensely. The authorities, I learnt, were\ndissatisfied with our lieutenant‐colonel. He was suspected of\nirregularities; in fact, his enemies were preparing a surprise for him.\nAnd then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil\nof a shindy. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire. I won’t tell\nyou how it all happened. He had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a\nmarked coolness in the town towards him and all his family. His friends\nall turned their backs on him. Then I took my first step. I met Agafya\nIvanovna, with whom I’d always kept up a friendship, and said, ‘Do you\nknow there’s a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your\nfather’s accounts?’\n\n“ ‘What do you mean? What makes you say so? The general was here not\nlong ago, and everything was all right.’\n\n“ ‘Then it was, but now it isn’t.’\n\n“She was terribly scared.\n\n“ ‘Don’t frighten me!’ she said. ‘Who told you so?’\n\n“ ‘Don’t be uneasy,’ I said, ‘I won’t tell any one. You know I’m as\nsilent as the tomb. I only wanted, in view of “possibilities,” to add,\nthat when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he can’t\nproduce it, he’ll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in\nhis old age, unless you like to send me your young lady secretly. I’ve\njust had money paid me. I’ll give her four thousand, if you like, and\nkeep the secret religiously.’\n\n“ ‘Ah, you scoundrel!’—that’s what she said. ‘You wicked scoundrel! How\ndare you!’\n\n“She went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her once more\nthat the secret should be kept sacred. Those two simple creatures,\nAgafya and her aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect\nangels all through this business. They genuinely adored their ‘Katya,’\nthought her far above them, and waited on her, hand and foot. But\nAgafya told her of our conversation. I found that out afterwards. She\ndidn’t keep it back, and of course that was all I wanted.",
            "5": "“Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion. The\nold lieutenant‐colonel was taken ill at once, couldn’t leave his room\nfor two days, and didn’t hand over the government money. Dr. Kravchenko\ndeclared that he really was ill. But I knew for a fact, and had known\nfor a long time, that for the last four years the money had never been\nin his hands except when the Commander made his visits of inspection.\nHe used to lend it to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town\ncalled Trifonov, an old widower, with a big beard and gold‐rimmed\nspectacles. He used to go to the fair, do a profitable business with\nthe money, and return the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a\npresent from the fair, as well as interest on the loan. But this time\n(I heard all about it quite by chance from Trifonov’s son and heir, a\ndriveling youth and one of the most vicious in the world)—this time, I\nsay, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair. The\nlieutenant‐colonel flew to him. ‘I’ve never received any money from\nyou, and couldn’t possibly have received any.’ That was all the answer\nhe got. So now our lieutenant‐colonel is confined to the house, with a\ntowel round his head, while they’re all three busy putting ice on it.\nAll at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order\nto ‘hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.’ He\nsigned the book (I saw the signature in the book afterwards), stood up,\nsaying he would put on his uniform, ran to his bedroom, loaded his\ndouble‐barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot off his right\nfoot, fixed the gun against his chest, and began feeling for the\ntrigger with his foot. But Agafya, remembering what I had told her, had\nher suspicions. She stole up and peeped into the room just in time. She\nrushed in, flung herself upon him from behind, threw her arms round\nhim, and the gun went off, hit the ceiling, but hurt no one. The others\nran in, took away the gun, and held him by the arms. I heard all about\nthis afterwards. I was at home, it was getting dusk, and I was just\npreparing to go out. I had dressed, brushed my hair, scented my\nhandkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and\nfacing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.",
            "6": "“It’s strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her in the\nstreet, so that no one knew of it in the town. I lodged with two\ndecrepit old ladies, who looked after me. They were most obliging old\nthings, ready to do anything for me, and at my request were as silent\nafterwards as two cast‐iron posts. Of course I grasped the position at\nonce. She walked in and looked straight at me, her dark eyes\ndetermined, even defiant, but on her lips and round her mouth I saw\nuncertainty.\n\n“ ‘My sister told me,’ she began, ‘that you would give me 4,500 roubles\nif I came to you for it—myself. I have come ... give me the money!’\n\n“She couldn’t keep it up. She was breathless, frightened, her voice\nfailed her, and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it\nquivered. Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?”\n\n“Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,” said Alyosha in\nagitation.",
            "7": "“I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I\nshan’t spare myself. My first idea was a—Karamazov one. Once I was\nbitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from\nit. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then—a noxious insect,\nyou understand? I looked her up and down. You’ve seen her? She’s a\nbeauty. But she was beautiful in another way then. At that moment she\nwas beautiful because she was noble, and I was a scoundrel; she in all\nthe grandeur of her generosity and sacrifice for her father, and I—a\nbug! And, scoundrel as I was, she was altogether at my mercy, body and\nsoul. She was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that\nvenomous thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with\nsuspense. It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I\nshould act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of pity.\nI could scarcely breathe. Understand, I should have gone next day to\nask for her hand, so that it might end honorably, so to speak, and that\nnobody would or could know. For though I’m a man of base desires, I’m\nhonest. And at that very second some voice seemed to whisper in my ear,\n‘But when you come to‐morrow to make your proposal, that girl won’t\neven see you; she’ll order her coachman to kick you out of the yard.\n“Publish it through all the town,” she would say, “I’m not afraid of\nyou.” ’ I looked at the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That\nis how it would be, not a doubt of it. I could see from her face now\nthat I should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. I longed\nto play her the nastiest swinish cad’s trick: to look at her with a\nsneer, and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with a\ntone of voice that only a shopman could use.\n\n“ ‘Four thousand! What do you mean? I was joking. You’ve been counting\nyour chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my\nheart. But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity.\nYou’ve put yourself out to no purpose.’",
            "8": "“I should have lost the game, of course. She’d have run away. But it\nwould have been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all.\nI’d have howled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have\nplayed that trick. Would you believe it, it has never happened to me\nwith any other woman, not one, to look at her at such a moment with\nhatred. But, on my oath, I looked at her for three seconds, or five\nperhaps, with fearful hatred—that hate which is only a hair’s‐breadth\nfrom love, from the maddest love!\n\n“I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I\nremember the ice burnt my forehead like fire. I did not keep her long,\ndon’t be afraid. I turned round, went up to the table, opened the\ndrawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles (it was lying\nin a French dictionary). Then I showed it her in silence, folded it,\nhanded it to her, opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back,\nmade her a deep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe\nme! She shuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly\npale—white as a sheet, in fact—and all at once, not impetuously but\nsoftly, gently, bowed down to my feet—not a boarding‐school curtsey,\nbut a Russian bow, with her forehead to the floor. She jumped up and\nran away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself\nwith it on the spot; why, I don’t know. It would have been frightfully\nstupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand\nthat one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn’t stab myself. I\nonly kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard—which there was no\nneed to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in telling you\nabout my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to glorify\nmyself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into the human\nheart! Well, so much for that ‘adventure’ with Katerina Ivanovna. So\nnow Ivan knows of it, and you—no one else.”\n\nDmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his\nhandkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the\nsame place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to\nturn quite round to face him."

The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.”\n\n“And I understand nothing of that second half so far,” said Alyosha.\n\n“And I? Do you suppose I understand it?”\n\n“Stop, Dmitri. There’s one important question. Tell me, you were\nbetrothed, you are betrothed still?”\n\n“We weren’t betrothed at once, not for three months after that\nadventure. The next day I told myself that the incident was closed,\nconcluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to\nmake her an offer. On her side she gave no sign of life for the six\nweeks that she remained in the town; except, indeed, for one action.\nThe day after her visit the maid‐servant slipped round with an envelope\naddressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the change out of the\nbanknote. Only four thousand five hundred roubles was needed, but there\nwas a discount of about two hundred on changing it. She only sent me\nabout two hundred and sixty. I don’t remember exactly, but not a note,\nnot a word of explanation. I searched the packet for a pencil\nmark—n‐nothing! Well, I spent the rest of the money on such an orgy\nthat the new major was obliged to reprimand me.\n\n“Well, the lieutenant‐colonel produced the battalion money, to the\nastonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he had the money\nuntouched. He’d no sooner paid it than he fell ill, took to his bed,\nand, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he died five\ndays afterwards. He was buried with military honors, for he had not had\ntime to receive his discharge. Ten days after his funeral, Katerina\nIvanovna, with her aunt and sister, went to Moscow. And, behold, on the\nvery day they went away (I hadn’t seen them, didn’t see them off or\ntake leave) I received a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on\nit only one line in pencil: ‘I will write to you. Wait. K.’ And that\nwas all.",
            "1": "“I’ll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes\nchanged with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an\nArabian fairy‐tale. That general’s widow, their nearest relation,\nsuddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and\nnext‐of‐kin—both died in the same week of small‐pox. The old lady,\nprostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her one hope,\nclutched at her, altered her will in Katya’s favor. But that concerned\nthe future. Meanwhile she gave her, for present use, eighty thousand\nroubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she liked with. She was an\nhysterical woman. I saw something of her in Moscow, later.\n\n“Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles.\nI was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later\ncame the promised letter. I have it with me now. You must read it. She\noffers to be my wife, offers herself to me. ‘I love you madly,’ she\nsays, ‘even if you don’t love me, never mind. Be my husband. Don’t be\nafraid. I won’t hamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will\nbe the carpet under your feet. I want to love you for ever. I want to\nsave you from yourself.’ Alyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines\nin my vulgar words and in my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone,\nthat I can never cure myself of. That letter stabs me even now. Do you\nthink I don’t mind—that I don’t mind still? I wrote her an answer at\nonce, as it was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her with\ntears. One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her\nbeing rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck‐up beggar! I\nmentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it slipped\nfrom my pen. Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him all I could\nabout it in a letter of six pages, and sent him to her. Why do you look\nlike that? Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with her;\nhe’s in love with her still. I know that. I did a stupid thing, in the\nworld’s opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving of\nus all now. Oo! Don’t you see what a lot she thinks of Ivan, how she\nrespects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man\nlike me, especially after all that has happened here?”\n\n“But I am convinced that she does love a man like you, and not a man\nlike him.”",
            "2": "“She loves her own _virtue_, not me.” The words broke involuntarily,\nand almost malignantly, from Dmitri. He laughed, but a minute later his\neyes gleamed, he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with\nhis fist.\n\n“I swear, Alyosha,” he cried, with intense and genuine anger at\nhimself; “you may not believe me, but as God is holy, and as Christ is\nGod, I swear that though I smiled at her lofty sentiments just now, I\nknow that I am a million times baser in soul than she, and that these\nlofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly angel’s. That’s\nthe tragedy of it—that I know that for certain. What if any one does\nshow off a bit? Don’t I do it myself? And yet I’m sincere, I’m sincere.\nAs for Ivan, I can understand how he must be cursing nature now—with\nhis intellect, too! To see the preference given—to whom, to what? To a\nmonster who, though he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him,\ncan’t restrain his debaucheries—and before the very eyes of his\nbetrothed! And a man like me is preferred, while he is rejected. And\nwhy? Because a girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of\ngratitude. It’s ridiculous! I’ve never said a word of this to Ivan, and\nIvan of course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me. But destiny\nwill be accomplished, and the best man will hold his ground while the\nundeserving one will vanish into his back‐ alley for ever—his filthy\nback‐alley, his beloved back‐alley, where he is at home and where he\nwill sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with enjoyment.\nI’ve been talking foolishly. I’ve no words left. I use them at random,\nbut it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the back‐ alley, and\nshe will marry Ivan.”\n\n“Stop, Dmitri,” Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. “There’s\none thing you haven’t made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the\nsame, aren’t you? How can you break off the engagement if she, your\nbetrothed, doesn’t want to?”\n\n“Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in\nMoscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style. The\ngeneral’s wife blessed us, and—would you believe it?—congratulated\nKatya. ‘You’ve made a good choice,’ she said, ‘I see right through\nhim.’ And—would you believe it?—she didn’t like Ivan, and hardly\ngreeted him. I had a lot of talk with Katya in Moscow. I told her about\nmyself—sincerely, honorably. She listened to everything.\n\nThere was sweet confusion,\nThere were tender words.",
            "3": "\nThough there were proud words, too. She wrung out of me a mighty\npromise to reform. I gave my promise, and here—”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why, I called to you and brought you out here to‐day, this very\nday—remember it—to send you—this very day again—to Katerina Ivanovna,\nand—”\n\n“What?”\n\n“To tell her that I shall never come to see her again. Say, ‘He sends\nyou his compliments.’ ”\n\n“But is that possible?”\n\n“That’s just the reason I’m sending you, in my place, because it’s\nimpossible. And, how could I tell her myself?”\n\n“And where are you going?”\n\n“To the back‐alley.”\n\n“To Grushenka, then!” Alyosha exclaimed mournfully, clasping his hands.\n“Can Rakitin really have told the truth? I thought that you had just\nvisited her, and that was all.”",
            "4": "“Can a betrothed man pay such visits? Is such a thing possible and with\nsuch a betrothed, and before the eyes of all the world? Confound it, I\nhave some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be\nbetrothed, and to be an honest man. I understand that. Why do you look\nat me? You see, I went in the first place to beat her. I had heard, and\nI know for a fact now, that that captain, father’s agent, had given\nGrushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her to sue me for payment, so as to put\nan end to me. They wanted to scare me. I went to beat her. I had had a\nglimpse of her before. She doesn’t strike one at first sight. I knew\nabout her old merchant, who’s lying ill now, paralyzed; but he’s\nleaving her a decent little sum. I knew, too, that she was fond of\nmoney, that she hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest,\nthat she’s a merciless cheat and swindler. I went to beat her, and I\nstayed. The storm broke—it struck me down like the plague. I’m\nplague‐stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there\nwill never be anything more for me. The cycle of the ages is\naccomplished. That’s my position. And though I’m a beggar, as fate\nwould have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket. I drove\nwith Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty‐five versts from here. I got\ngypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there drunk on\nit, and all the women and girls. I sent the thousands flying. In three\ndays’ time I was stripped bare, but a hero. Do you suppose the hero had\ngained his end? Not a sign of it from her. I tell you that rogue,\nGrushenka, has a supple curve all over her body. You can see it in her\nlittle foot, even in her little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that\nwas all, I swear! ‘I’ll marry you if you like,’ she said, ‘you’re a\nbeggar, you know. Say that you won’t beat me, and will let me do\nanything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.’ She laughed, and\nshe’s laughing still!”\n\nDmitri leapt up with a sort of fury. He seemed all at once as though he\nwere drunk. His eyes became suddenly bloodshot.\n\n“And do you really mean to marry her?”",
            "5": "“At once, if she will. And if she won’t, I shall stay all the same.\nI’ll be the porter at her gate. Alyosha!” he cried. He stopped short\nbefore him, and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him\nviolently. “Do you know, you innocent boy, that this is all delirium,\nsenseless delirium, for there’s a tragedy here. Let me tell you,\nAlexey, that I may be a low man, with low and degraded passions, but a\nthief and a pickpocket Dmitri Karamazov never can be. Well, then; let\nme tell you that I am a thief and a pickpocket. That very morning, just\nbefore I went to beat Grushenka, Katerina Ivanovna sent for me, and in\nstrict secrecy (why I don’t know, I suppose she had some reason) asked\nme to go to the chief town of the province and to post three thousand\nroubles to Agafya Ivanovna in Moscow, so that nothing should be known\nof it in the town here. So I had that three thousand roubles in my\npocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at\nMokroe. Afterwards I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show\nher the post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would\nbring the receipt, and so far I haven’t brought it. I’ve forgotten it.\nNow what do you think you’re going to her to‐day to say? ‘He sends his\ncompliments,’ and she’ll ask you, ‘What about the money?’ You might\nstill have said to her, ‘He’s a degraded sensualist, and a low\ncreature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn’t send your money then,\nbut wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn’t control himself.’\nBut still you might have added, ‘He isn’t a thief though. Here is your\nthree thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna.\nBut he told me to say “he sends his compliments.” ’ But, as it is, she\nwill ask, ‘But where is the money?’ ”\n\n“Mitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don’t\nworry yourself to death with despair.”\n\n“What, do you suppose I’d shoot myself because I can’t get three\nthousand to pay back? That’s just it. I shan’t shoot myself. I haven’t\nthe strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I’m going to Grushenka.\nI don’t care what happens.”\n\n“And what then?”\n\n“I’ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come,\nI’ll go into the next room. I’ll clean her friends’ goloshes, blow up\ntheir samovar, run their errands.”",
            "6": "“Katerina Ivanovna will understand it all,” Alyosha said solemnly.\n“She’ll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive.

She’ll see\nthat for herself.”\n\n“She won’t forgive everything,” said Dmitri, with a grin. “There’s\nsomething in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what\nwould be the best thing to do?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Pay back the three thousand.”\n\n“Where can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give\nyou another thousand—that makes three. Take it and pay it back.”\n\n“And when would you get it, your three thousand? You’re not of age,\nbesides, and you must—you absolutely must—take my farewell to her\nto‐day, with the money or without it, for I can’t drag on any longer,\nthings have come to such a pass. To‐morrow is too late. I shall send\nyou to father.”\n\n“To father?”\n\n“Yes, to father first. Ask him for three thousand.”\n\n“But, Mitya, he won’t give it.”\n\n“As though he would! I know he won’t. Do you know the meaning of\ndespair, Alexey?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Listen. Legally he owes me nothing. I’ve had it all from him, I know\nthat. But morally he owes me something, doesn’t he? You know he started\nwith twenty‐eight thousand of my mother’s money and made a hundred\nthousand with it. Let him give me back only three out of the\ntwenty‐eight thousand, and he’ll draw my soul out of hell, and it will\natone for many of his sins. For that three thousand—I give you my\nsolemn word—I’ll make an end of everything, and he shall hear nothing\nmore of me. For the last time I give him the chance to be a father.\nTell him God Himself sends him this chance.”\n\n“Mitya, he won’t give it for anything.”",
            "7": "“I know he won’t. I know it perfectly well. Now, especially. That’s not\nall. I know something more. Now, only a few days ago, perhaps only\nyesterday he found out for the first time _in earnest_ (underline _in\nearnest_) that Grushenka is really perhaps not joking, and really means\nto marry me. He knows her nature; he knows the cat. And do you suppose\nhe’s going to give me money to help to bring that about when he’s crazy\nabout her himself? And that’s not all, either. I can tell you more than\nthat. I know that for the last five days he has had three thousand\ndrawn out of the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed\ninto a large envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red\ntape. You see how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written:\n‘To my angel, Grushenka, when she will come to me.’ He scrawled it\nhimself in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money’s\nthere except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he trusts like himself. So now\nhe has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he\nhopes she’ll come for the money. He has sent her word of it, and she\nhas sent him word that perhaps she’ll come. And if she does go to the\nold man, can I marry her after that? You understand now why I’m here in\nsecret and what I’m on the watch for.”\n\n“For her?”\n\n“Yes, for her. Foma has a room in the house of these sluts here. Foma\ncomes from our parts; he was a soldier in our regiment. He does jobs\nfor them. He’s watchman at night and goes grouse‐shooting in the\nday‐time; and that’s how he lives. I’ve established myself in his room.\nNeither he nor the women of the house know the secret—that is, that I\nam on the watch here.”\n\n“No one but Smerdyakov knows, then?”\n\n“No one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.”\n\n“It was he told you about the money, then?”\n\n“Yes. It’s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn’t know about the money, or\nanything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three\ndays’ journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he’ll give\neight thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help\nhim by going to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That’s\nwhat the old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he’s away.”\n\n“Then he’s expecting Grushenka to‐day?”",
            "8": "“No, she won’t come to‐day; there are signs. She’s certain not to\ncome,” cried Mitya suddenly. “Smerdyakov thinks so, too. Father’s\ndrinking now. He’s sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and\nask for the three thousand.”\n\n“Mitya, dear, what’s the matter with you?” cried Alyosha, jumping up\nfrom his place, and looking keenly at his brother’s frenzied face. For\none moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad.\n\n“What is it? I’m not insane,” said Dmitri, looking intently and\nearnestly at him. “No fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what\nI’m saying. I believe in miracles.”\n\n“In miracles?”\n\n“In a miracle of Divine Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my\ndespair. He sees the whole picture. Surely He won’t let something awful\nhappen. Alyosha, I believe in miracles. Go!”\n\n“I am going. Tell me, will you wait for me here?”\n\n“Yes. I know it will take some time. You can’t go at him point blank.\nHe’s drunk now. I’ll wait three hours—four, five, six, seven. Only\nremember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to‐day, if it has to be at\nmidnight, _with the money or without the money_, and say, ‘He sends his\ncompliments to you.’ I want you to say that verse to her: ‘He sends his\ncompliments to you.’ ”\n\n“Mitya! And what if Grushenka comes to‐day—if not to‐day, to‐morrow, or\nthe next day?”\n\n“Grushenka? I shall see her. I shall rush out and prevent it.”\n\n“And if—”\n\n“If there’s an if, it will be murder. I couldn’t endure it.”\n\n“Who will be murdered?”\n\n“The old man. I shan’t kill her.”\n\n“Brother, what are you saying?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know.... I don’t know. Perhaps I shan’t kill, and perhaps\nI shall. I’m afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me\nwith his face at that moment. I hate his ugly throat, his nose, his\neyes, his shameless snigger. I feel a physical repulsion. That’s what\nI’m afraid of. That’s what may be too much for me.”\n\n“I’ll go, Mitya. I believe that God will order things for the best,\nthat nothing awful may happen.”\n\n“And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn’t come to\npass—”\n\nAlyosha went thoughtfully towards his father’s house."

            "0": "He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a\ndining‐ room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the\ndrawing‐room, which was the largest room, and furnished with\nold‐fashioned ostentation. The furniture was white and very old,\nupholstered in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the\nwindows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of\nold‐fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper, which\nwas torn in many places, there hung two large portraits—one of some\nprince who had been governor of the district thirty years before, and\nthe other of some bishop, also long since dead. In the corner opposite\nthe door there were several ikons, before which a lamp was lighted at\nnightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as to light the room.\nFyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three or four o’clock\nin the morning, and would wander about the room at night or sit in an\narm‐chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He often slept\nquite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but\nusually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.\n\nWhen Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had\nbeen served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after\ndinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory\nand Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants\nseemed in singularly good spirits. Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with\nlaughter. Before he entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he\nknew so well, and could tell from the sound of it that his father had\nonly reached the good‐humored stage, and was far from being completely\ndrunk.\n\n“Here he is! Here he is!” yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at\nseeing Alyosha. “Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it’s\nhot and good. I don’t offer you brandy, you’re keeping the fast. But\nwould you like some? No; I’d better give you some of our famous\nliqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right.\nHere are the keys. Look sharp!”\n\nAlyosha began refusing the liqueur.\n\n“Never mind. If you won’t have it, we will,” said Fyodor Pavlovitch,\nbeaming. “But stay—have you dined?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread\nand drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior’s kitchen. “Though I\nshould be pleased to have some hot coffee.”",
            "1": "“Bravo, my darling! He’ll have some coffee. Does it want warming? No,\nit’s boiling. It’s capital coffee: Smerdyakov’s making. My Smerdyakov’s\nan artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too. You\nmust come one day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand....\nBut, stay; didn’t I tell you this morning to come home with your\nmattress and pillow and all? Have you brought your mattress? He he he!”\n\n“No, I haven’t,” said Alyosha, smiling, too.\n\n“Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren’t\nyou? There, my darling, I couldn’t do anything to vex you. Do you know,\nIvan, I can’t resist the way he looks one straight in the face and\nlaughs? It makes me laugh all over. I’m so fond of him. Alyosha, let me\ngive you my blessing—a father’s blessing.”\n\nAlyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his mind.\n\n“No, no,” he said. “I’ll just make the sign of the cross over you, for\nnow. Sit still. Now we’ve a treat for you, in your own line, too. It’ll\nmake you laugh. Balaam’s ass has begun talking to us here—and how he\ntalks! How he talks!”\n\nBalaam’s ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He was a young\nman of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn. Not\nthat he was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he was conceited and\nseemed to despise everybody.",
            "2": "But we must pause to say a few words about him now. He was brought up\nby Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up “with no sense of gratitude,”\nas Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look\nat the world mistrustfully. In his childhood he was very fond of\nhanging cats, and burying them with great ceremony. He used to dress up\nin a sheet as though it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some\nobject over the dead cat as though it were a censer. All this he did on\nthe sly, with the greatest secrecy. Grigory caught him once at this\ndiversion and gave him a sound beating. He shrank into a corner and\nsulked there for a week. “He doesn’t care for you or me, the monster,”\nGrigory used to say to Marfa, “and he doesn’t care for any one. Are you\na human being?” he said, addressing the boy directly. “You’re not a\nhuman being. You grew from the mildew in the bath‐house.[2] That’s what\nyou are.” Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could never forgive him\nthose words. Grigory taught him to read and write, and when he was\ntwelve years old, began teaching him the Scriptures. But this teaching\ncame to nothing. At the second or third lesson the boy suddenly\ngrinned.\n\n“What’s that for?” asked Grigory, looking at him threateningly from\nunder his spectacles.\n\n“Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon,\nand stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first\nday?”",
            "3": "Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his teacher.\nThere was something positively condescending in his expression. Grigory\ncould not restrain himself. “I’ll show you where!” he cried, and gave\nthe boy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a\nword, but withdrew into his corner again for some days. A week later he\nhad his first attack of the disease to which he was subject all the\nrest of his life—epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his\nattitude to the boy seemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no\nnotice of him, though he never scolded him, and always gave him a\ncopeck when he met him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would\nsend the boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of\nhis illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor,\nand tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The\nfits occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals.\nThe fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very\nsevere. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal\npunishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs to him.\nHe forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a time, too. One day\nwhen the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch noticed him lingering\nby the bookcase, and reading the titles through the glass. Fyodor\nPavlovitch had a fair number of books—over a hundred—but no one ever\nsaw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase.\n“Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You’ll be better sitting\nreading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,” and Fyodor\nPavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_.\n\nHe read a little but didn’t like it. He did not once smile, and ended\nby frowning.\n\n“Why? Isn’t it funny?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\nSmerdyakov did not speak.\n\n“Answer, stupid!”\n\n“It’s all untrue,” mumbled the boy, with a grin.\n\n“Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey. Stay, here’s\nSmaragdov’s _Universal History_. That’s all true. Read that.”\n\nBut Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought\nit dull. So the bookcase was closed again.\n\nShortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that\nSmerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary\nfastidiousness. He would sit before his soup, take up his spoon and\nlook into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold\nit to the light.",
            "4": "“What is it? A beetle?” Grigory would ask.\n\n“A fly, perhaps,” observed Marfa.\n\nThe squeamish youth never answered, but he did the same with his bread,\nhis meat, and everything he ate. He would hold a piece on his fork to\nthe light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long\ndeliberation decide to put it in his mouth.\n\n“Ach! What fine gentlemen’s airs!” Grigory muttered, looking at him.\n\nWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he\ndetermined to make him his cook, and sent him to Moscow to be trained.\nHe spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in\nappearance. He looked extraordinarily old for his age. His face had\ngrown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he\nseemed almost exactly the same as before he went away. He was just as\nunsociable, and showed not the slightest inclination for any\ncompanionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard afterwards, he had always\nbeen silent. Moscow itself had little interest for him; he saw very\nlittle there, and took scarcely any notice of anything. He went once to\nthe theater, but returned silent and displeased with it. On the other\nhand, he came back to us from Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and\nclean linen. He brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day\ninvariably, and was very fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a\nspecial English polish, so that they shone like mirrors. He turned out\na first‐rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the\nwhole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such\nthings. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as\nfor men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor\nPavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were\nbecoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which\ndid not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.\n\n“Why are your fits getting worse?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking\naskance at his new cook. “Would you like to get married? Shall I find\nyou a wife?”",
            "5": "But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor\nPavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that\nhe had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when\nFyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard\nthree hundred‐rouble notes which he had only just received. He only\nmissed them next day, and was just hastening to search his pockets when\nhe saw the notes lying on the table. Where had they come from?\nSmerdyakov had picked them up and brought them in the day before.\n\n“Well, my lad, I’ve never met any one like you,” Fyodor Pavlovitch said\nshortly, and gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not only believed\nin his honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him, although\nthe young man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always\nsilent. He rarely spoke. If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the\ntime what the young man was interested in, and what was in his mind, it\nwould have been impossible to tell by looking at him. Yet he used\nsometimes to stop suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street,\nand would stand still for ten minutes, lost in thought. A physiognomist\nstudying his face would have said that there was no thought in it, no\nreflection, but only a sort of contemplation. There is a remarkable\npicture by the painter Kramskoy, called “Contemplation.” There is a\nforest in winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute\nsolitude, stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes. He stands,\nas it were, lost in thought. Yet he is not thinking; he is\n“contemplating.” If any one touched him he would start and look at one\nas though awakening and bewildered. It’s true he would come to himself\nimmediately; but if he were asked what he had been thinking about, he\nwould remember nothing. Yet probably he has, hidden within himself, the\nimpression which had dominated him during the period of contemplation.\nThose impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards them\nimperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he does\nnot know either. He may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many\nyears, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for\nhis soul’s salvation, or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his\nnative village, and perhaps do both. There are a good many\n“contemplatives” among the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one\nof them, and he probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions,\nhardly knowing why."

            "0": "But Balaam’s ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one.\nGrigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from\nthe shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had\nappeared in the newspaper of that day. This soldier had been taken\nprisoner in some remote part of Asia, and was threatened with an\nimmediate agonizing death if he did not renounce Christianity and\nfollow Islam. He refused to deny his faith, and was tortured, flayed\nalive, and died, praising and glorifying Christ. Grigory had related\nthe story at table. Fyodor Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert\nafter dinner, to laugh and talk, if only with Grigory. This afternoon\nhe was in a particularly good‐humored and expansive mood. Sipping his\nbrandy and listening to the story, he observed that they ought to make\na saint of a soldier like that, and to take his skin to some monastery.\n“That would make the people flock, and bring the money in.”\n\nGrigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched,\nbut, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who\nwas standing by the door, smiled. Smerdyakov often waited at table\ntowards the end of dinner, and since Ivan’s arrival in our town he had\ndone so every day.\n\n“What are you grinning at?” asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile\ninstantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory.\n\n“Well, my opinion is,” Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a\nloud voice, “that if that laudable soldier’s exploit was so very great\nthere would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he had on such\nan emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his own\nchristening, to save by that same his life, for good deeds, by which,\nin the course of years to expiate his cowardice.”\n\n“How could it not be a sin? You’re talking nonsense. For that you’ll go\nstraight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,” put in Fyodor\nPavlovitch.\n\nIt was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we\nhave seen, was highly delighted at his appearance.\n\n“We’re on your subject, your subject,” he chuckled gleefully, making\nAlyosha sit down to listen.\n\n“As for mutton, that’s not so, and there’ll be nothing there for this,\nand there shouldn’t be either, if it’s according to justice,”\nSmerdyakov maintained stoutly.\n\n“How do you mean ‘according to justice’?” Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still\nmore gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee.",
            "1": "“He’s a rascal, that’s what he is!” burst from Grigory. He looked\nSmerdyakov wrathfully in the face.\n\n“As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” answered\nSmerdyakov with perfect composure. “You’d better consider yourself\nthat, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race,\nand they demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my\nholy christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since\nthere would be no sin in it.”\n\n“But you’ve said that before. Don’t waste words. Prove it,” cried\nFyodor Pavlovitch.\n\n“Soup‐maker!” muttered Grigory contemptuously.\n\n“As for being a soup‐maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself,\nGrigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to\nthose enemies, ‘No, I’m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,’ then\nat once, by God’s high judgment, I become immediately and specially\nanathema accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as\nthough I were a heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I\nsay it aloud, but when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a\nsecond has passed, I am cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory\nVassilyevitch?”\n\nHe addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really\nanswering Fyodor Pavlovitch’s questions, and was well aware of it, and\nintentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.\n\n“Ivan,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, “stoop down for me to\nwhisper. He’s got this all up for your benefit. He wants you to praise\nhim. Praise him.”\n\nIvan listened with perfect seriousness to his father’s excited whisper.\n\n“Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once\nmore. “Ivan, your ear again.”\n\nIvan bent down again with a perfectly grave face.\n\n“I love you as I do Alyosha. Don’t think I don’t love you. Some\nbrandy?”\n\n“Yes.—But you’re rather drunk yourself,” thought Ivan, looking steadily\nat his father.\n\nHe was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.\n\n“You’re anathema accursed, as it is,” Grigory suddenly burst out, “and\nhow dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if—”\n\n“Don’t scold him, Grigory, don’t scold him,” Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him\nshort.\n\n“You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and\nlisten, for I haven’t finished all I had to say. For at the very moment\nI become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a\nheathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail.\nIsn’t that so?”",
            "2": "“Make haste and finish, my boy,” Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping\nfrom his wine‐glass with relish.\n\n“And if I’ve ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy\nwhen they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I\nhad already been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason\nof the thought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy.\nAnd if I have already been discharged, in what manner and with what\nsort of justice can I be held responsible as a Christian in the other\nworld for having denied Christ, when, through the very thought alone,\nbefore denying Him I had been relieved from my christening? If I’m no\nlonger a Christian, then I can’t renounce Christ, for I’ve nothing then\nto renounce. Who will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory\nVassilyevitch, even in heaven, for not having been born a Christian?\nAnd who would punish him for that, considering that you can’t take two\nskins off one ox? For God Almighty Himself, even if He did make the\nTatar responsible, when he dies would give him the smallest possible\npunishment, I imagine (since he must be punished), judging that he is\nnot to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen, from\nheathen parents. The Lord God can’t surely take a Tatar and say he was\na Christian? That would mean that the Almighty would tell a real\nuntruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even in one\nword?”\n\nGrigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his eyes nearly\nstarting out of his head. Though he did not clearly understand what was\nsaid, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking\nlike a man who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch\nemptied his glass and went off into his shrill laugh.\n\n“Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must\nhave been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit,\nwho taught you? But you’re talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense,\nnonsense, nonsense. Don’t cry, Grigory, we’ll reduce him to smoke and\nashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your\nenemies, but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own\nheart, and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema\naccursed. And if once you’re anathema they won’t pat you on the head\nfor it in hell. What do you say to that, my fine Jesuit?”",
            "3": "“There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there\nwas no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most\nordinary.”\n\n“How’s that the most ordinary?”\n\n“You lie, accursed one!” hissed Grigory.\n\n“Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,” Smerdyakov went on, staid\nand unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to\nthe vanquished foe. “Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is\nsaid in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed,\nand bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least\ndelay at your bidding. Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I’m without\nfaith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing\nat me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea\nfor that’s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which\nruns at the bottom of the garden. You’ll see for yourself that it won’t\nbudge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it,\nand that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven’t faith in the\nproper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into\nconsideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no\none, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains\ninto the sea—except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most,\ntwo, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in\nthe Egyptian desert, so you wouldn’t find them—if so it be, if all the\nrest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the\npopulation of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert,\nand in His well‐known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I’m\npersuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I\nshed tears of repentance.”\n\n“Stay!” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. “So you do\nsuppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it,\nwrite it down. There you have the Russian all over!”\n\n“You’re quite right in saying it’s characteristic of the people’s\nfaith,” Ivan assented, with an approving smile.\n\n“You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It’s true, isn’t it,\nAlyosha? That’s the Russian faith all over, isn’t it?”\n\n“No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,” said Alyosha firmly\nand gravely.\n\n“I’m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only\nthat idea. Surely that’s Russian, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes, that’s purely Russian,” said Alyosha smiling.",
            "4": "“Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I’ll give it to you\nto‐day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let\nme tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from\ncarelessness, because we haven’t time; things are too much for us, and,\nin the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only\ntwenty‐four hours in the day, so that one hasn’t even time to get sleep\nenough, much less to repent of one’s sins. While you have denied your\nfaith to your enemies when you’d nothing else to think about but to\nshow your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.”\n\n“Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\nthat it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed\nthen in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would\nhave been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone\nover to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn’t have\ncome to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that\ninstant to the mountain, ‘Move and crush the tormentor,’ and it would\nhave moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a\nblack‐beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had\nhappened, praising and glorifying God. But, suppose at that very moment\nI had tried all that, and cried to that mountain, ‘Crush these\ntormentors,’ and it hadn’t crushed them, how could I have helped\ndoubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of mortal\nterror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not\nattain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven (for since the mountain\nhad not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up\naloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world\nto come). So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to\nno good purpose? For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my\nback, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my\ncry. And at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one\nmight lose one’s reason from fear, so that one would not be able to\nthink at all. And, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if\nnot seeing my advantage or reward there or here, I should, at least,\nsave my skin. And so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should\ncherish the hope that I might be altogether forgiven.”"

            "0": "The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who\nhad been so gay, suddenly began frowning. He frowned and gulped brandy,\nand it was already a glass too much.\n\n“Get along with you, Jesuits!” he cried to the servants. “Go away,\nSmerdyakov. I’ll send you the gold piece I promised you to‐day, but be\noff! Don’t cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa. She’ll comfort you and put you to\nbed. The rascals won’t let us sit in peace after dinner,” he snapped\npeevishly, as the servants promptly withdrew at his word.\n\n“Smerdyakov always pokes himself in now, after dinner. It’s you he’s so\ninterested in. What have you done to fascinate him?” he added to Ivan.\n\n“Nothing whatever,” answered Ivan. “He’s pleased to have a high opinion\nof me; he’s a lackey and a mean soul. Raw material for revolution,\nhowever, when the time comes.”\n\n“For revolution?”\n\n“There will be others and better ones. But there will be some like him\nas well. His kind will come first, and better ones after.”\n\n“And when will the time come?”\n\n“The rocket will go off and fizzle out, perhaps. The peasants are not\nvery fond of listening to these soup‐makers, so far.”\n\n“Ah, brother, but a Balaam’s ass like that thinks and thinks, and the\ndevil knows where he gets to.”\n\n“He’s storing up ideas,” said Ivan, smiling.\n\n“You see, I know he can’t bear me, nor any one else, even you, though\nyou fancy that he has a high opinion of you. Worse still with Alyosha,\nhe despises Alyosha. But he doesn’t steal, that’s one thing, and he’s\nnot a gossip, he holds his tongue, and doesn’t wash our dirty linen in\npublic. He makes capital fish pasties too. But, damn him, is he worth\ntalking about so much?”\n\n“Of course he isn’t.”\n\n“And as for the ideas he may be hatching, the Russian peasant,\ngenerally speaking, needs thrashing. That I’ve always maintained. Our\npeasants are swindlers, and don’t deserve to be pitied, and it’s a good\nthing they’re still flogged sometimes. Russia is rich in birches. If\nthey destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up\nfor the clever people. We’ve left off thrashing the peasants, we’ve\ngrown so clever, but they go on thrashing themselves. And a good thing\ntoo. ‘For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again,’\nor how does it go? Anyhow, it will be measured. But Russia’s all\nswinishness. My dear, if you only knew how I hate Russia.... That is,\nnot Russia, but all this vice! But maybe I mean Russia. _Tout cela\nc’est de la cochonnerie_.... Do you know what I like? I like wit.”",
            "1": "“You’ve had another glass. That’s enough.”\n\n“Wait a bit. I’ll have one more, and then another, and then I’ll stop.\nNo, stay, you interrupted me. At Mokroe I was talking to an old man,\nand he told me: ‘There’s nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to\nbe thrashed, and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them. And\nthe girl he has thrashed to‐day, the young man will ask in marriage\nto‐morrow. So it quite suits the girls, too,’ he said. There’s a set of\nde Sades for you! But it’s clever, anyway. Shall we go over and have a\nlook at it, eh? Alyosha, are you blushing? Don’t be bashful, child. I’m\nsorry I didn’t stay to dinner at the Superior’s and tell the monks\nabout the girls at Mokroe. Alyosha, don’t be angry that I offended your\nSuperior this morning. I lost my temper. If there is a God, if He\nexists, then, of course, I’m to blame, and I shall have to answer for\nit. But if there isn’t a God at all, what do they deserve, your\nfathers? It’s not enough to cut their heads off, for they keep back\nprogress. Would you believe it, Ivan, that that lacerates my\nsentiments? No, you don’t believe it as I see from your eyes. You\nbelieve what people say, that I’m nothing but a buffoon. Alyosha, do\nyou believe that I’m nothing but a buffoon?”\n\n“No, I don’t believe it.”\n\n“And I believe you don’t, and that you speak the truth. You look\nsincere and you speak sincerely. But not Ivan. Ivan’s supercilious....\nI’d make an end of your monks, though, all the same. I’d take all that\nmystic stuff and suppress it, once for all, all over Russia, so as to\nbring all the fools to reason. And the gold and the silver that would\nflow into the mint!”\n\n“But why suppress it?” asked Ivan.\n\n“That Truth may prevail. That’s why.”\n\n“Well, if Truth were to prevail, you know, you’d be the first to be\nrobbed and suppressed.”\n\n“Ah! I dare say you’re right. Ah, I’m an ass!” burst out Fyodor\nPavlovitch, striking himself lightly on the forehead. “Well, your\nmonastery may stand then, Alyosha, if that’s how it is. And we clever\npeople will sit snug and enjoy our brandy. You know, Ivan, it must have\nbeen so ordained by the Almighty Himself. Ivan, speak, is there a God\nor not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing\nagain?”\n\n“I’m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about\nSmerdyakov’s belief in the existence of two saints who could move\nmountains.”\n\n“Why, am I like him now, then?”\n\n“Very much.”",
            "2": "“Well, that shows I’m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian\ncharacteristic. And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a\nphilosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I’ll catch you\nto‐morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not? Only, be\nserious. I want you to be serious now.”\n\n“No, there is no God.”\n\n“Alyosha, is there a God?”\n\n“There is.”\n\n“Ivan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a\ntiny bit?”\n\n“There is no immortality either.”\n\n“None at all?”\n\n“None at all.”\n\n“There’s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something?\nAnything is better than nothing!”\n\n“Absolute nothingness.”\n\n“Alyosha, is there immortality?”\n\n“There is.”\n\n“God and immortality?”\n\n“God and immortality. In God is immortality.”\n\n“H’m! It’s more likely Ivan’s right. Good Lord! to think what faith,\nwhat force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream,\nand for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For\nthe last time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last\ntime!”\n\n“And for the last time there is not.”\n\n“Who is laughing at mankind, Ivan?”\n\n“It must be the devil,” said Ivan, smiling.\n\n“And the devil? Does he exist?”\n\n“No, there’s no devil either.”\n\n“It’s a pity. Damn it all, what wouldn’t I do to the man who first\ninvented God! Hanging on a bitter aspen tree would be too good for\nhim.”\n\n“There would have been no civilization if they hadn’t invented God.”\n\n“Wouldn’t there have been? Without God?”\n\n“No. And there would have been no brandy either. But I must take your\nbrandy away from you, anyway.”\n\n“Stop, stop, stop, dear boy, one more little glass. I’ve hurt Alyosha’s\nfeelings. You’re not angry with me, Alyosha? My dear little Alexey!”\n\n“No, I am not angry. I know your thoughts. Your heart is better than\nyour head.”\n\n“My heart better than my head, is it? Oh, Lord! And that from you.\nIvan, do you love Alyosha?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You must love him” (Fyodor Pavlovitch was by this time very drunk).\n“Listen, Alyosha, I was rude to your elder this morning. But I was\nexcited. But there’s wit in that elder, don’t you think, Ivan?”\n\n“Very likely.”\n\n“There is, there is. _Il y a du Piron là‐dedans._ He’s a Jesuit, a\nRussian one, that is. As he’s an honorable person there’s a hidden\nindignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect\nholiness.”\n\n“But, of course, he believes in God.”",
            "3": "“Not a bit of it. Didn’t you know? Why, he tells every one so, himself.\nThat is, not every one, but all the clever people who come to him. He\nsaid straight out to Governor Schultz not long ago: ‘_Credo_, but I\ndon’t know in what.’ ”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“He really did. But I respect him. There’s something of Mephistopheles\nabout him, or rather of ‘The hero of our time’ ... Arbenin, or what’s\nhis name?... You see, he’s a sensualist. He’s such a sensualist that I\nshould be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to\nhim. You know, when he begins telling stories.... The year before last\nhe invited us to tea, tea with liqueur (the ladies send him liqueur),\nand began telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides....\nEspecially how he once cured a paralyzed woman. ‘If my legs were not\nbad I know a dance I could dance you,’ he said. What do you say to\nthat? ‘I’ve plenty of tricks in my time,’ said he. He did Dernidov, the\nmerchant, out of sixty thousand.”\n\n“What, he stole it?”\n\n“He brought him the money as a man he could trust, saying, ‘Take care\nof it for me, friend, there’ll be a police search at my place\nto‐morrow.’ And he kept it. ‘You have given it to the Church,’ he\ndeclared. I said to him: ‘You’re a scoundrel,’ I said. ‘No,’ said he,\n‘I’m not a scoundrel, but I’m broad‐minded.’ But that wasn’t he, that\nwas some one else. I’ve muddled him with some one else ... without\nnoticing it. Come, another glass and that’s enough. Take away the\nbottle, Ivan. I’ve been telling lies. Why didn’t you stop me, Ivan, and\ntell me I was lying?”\n\n“I knew you’d stop of yourself.”\n\n“That’s a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You\ndespise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.”\n\n“Well, I’m going away. You’ve had too much brandy.”\n\n“I’ve begged you for Christ’s sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or\ntwo, and you don’t go.”\n\n“I’ll go to‐morrow if you’re so set upon it.”\n\n“You won’t go. You want to keep an eye on me. That’s what you want,\nspiteful fellow. That’s why you won’t go.”\n\nThe old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when\nthe drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel\nand to assert himself.",
            "4": "“Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look\nat me and say, ‘You ugly drunkard!’ Your eyes are mistrustful. They’re\ncontemptuous.... You’ve come here with some design. Alyosha, here,\nlooks at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn’t despise me. Alexey, you\nmustn’t love Ivan.”\n\n“Don’t be ill‐tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,”\nAlyosha said emphatically.\n\n“Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It’s\nthe third time I’ve told you.”\n\nHe mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face.\n\n“Don’t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don’t love me,\nbut don’t be angry all the same. You’ve nothing to love me for. You go\nto Tchermashnya. I’ll come to you myself and bring you a present. I’ll\nshow you a little wench there. I’ve had my eye on her a long time.\nShe’s still running about bare‐foot. Don’t be afraid of bare‐footed\nwenches—don’t despise them—they’re pearls!”\n\nAnd he kissed his hand with a smack.",
            "5": "“To my thinking,” he revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant\nhe touched on his favorite topic. “To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You\nchildren, little sucking‐pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a\nwoman ugly in my life—that’s been my rule! Can you understand that? How\ncould you understand it? You’ve milk in your veins, not blood. You’re\nnot out of your shells yet. My rule has been that you can always find\nsomething devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn’t find\nin any other. Only, one must know how to find it, that’s the point!\nThat’s a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women. The very fact that\nshe is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you understand\nthat? Even in _vieilles filles_, even in them you may discover\nsomething that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as\nto let them grow old without noticing them. Bare‐footed girls or\nunattractive ones, you must take by surprise. Didn’t you know that? You\nmust astound them till they’re fascinated, upset, ashamed that such a\ngentleman should fall in love with such a little slut. It’s a jolly\ngood thing that there always are and will be masters and slaves in the\nworld, so there always will be a little maid‐ of‐all‐work and her\nmaster, and you know, that’s all that’s needed for happiness. Stay ...\nlisten, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your mother, but in a\ndifferent way. I paid no attention to her at all, but all at once, when\nthe minute came, I’d be all devotion to her, crawl on my knees, kiss\nher feet, and I always, always—I remember it as though it were\nto‐day—reduced her to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little\nlaugh. It was peculiar to her. I knew her attacks always used to begin\nlike that. The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically, and\nthis little laugh was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good\ncounterfeit. That’s the great thing, to know how to take every one.\nOnce Belyavsky—he was a handsome fellow, and rich—used to like to come\nhere and hang about her—suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her\npresence. And she—such a mild sheep—why, I thought she would have\nknocked me down for that blow. How she set on me! ‘You’re beaten,\nbeaten now,’ she said. ‘You’ve taken a blow from him. You have been\ntrying to sell me to him,’ she said.... ‘And how dared he strike you in\nmy presence! Don’t dare come near me again, never, never! Run at once,\nchallenge him to a duel!’... I took her to the monastery then to bring\nher to her senses. The holy Fathers prayed her back to reason. But I\nswear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only\nonce, perhaps, in the first year; then she was very fond of praying.\nShe used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn\nme out of her room then. I’ll knock that mysticism out of her, thought\nI! ‘Here,’ said I, ‘you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it\ndown. You believe it’s miraculous, but here, I’ll spit on it directly\nand nothing will happen to me for it!’... When she saw it, good Lord! I\nthought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her hands,\nthen suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and fell\non the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what’s the\nmatter?”",
            "6": "The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking\nabout his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha’s face. He\nflushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had\ngone spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something\nvery strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in\nthe crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from\nhis seat exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands,\nhid his face in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in\nan hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His\nextraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old\nman.\n\n“Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It’s like her, exactly as she used to be\nthen, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that’s what\nI used to do to her. He’s upset about his mother, his mother,” he\nmuttered to Ivan.\n\n“But she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?” said\nIvan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before\nhis flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only\nfor a second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man’s mind that\nAlyosha’s mother actually was the mother of Ivan too.\n\n“Your mother?” he muttered, not understanding. “What do you mean? What\nmother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she\nwas yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before.\nExcuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!” He stopped. A\nbroad, drunken, half‐senseless grin overspread his face.\n\nAt that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there\nwere violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the\nroom. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.\n\n“He’ll kill me! He’ll kill me! Don’t let him get at me!” he screamed,\nclinging to the skirt of Ivan’s coat."

They had been\nstruggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on\ninstructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking\nadvantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room\nto look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors\non the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and\nstood before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to\ndefend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood.\nSeeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at\nGrigory.\n\n“Then she’s there! She’s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!”\n\nHe tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back.\nBeside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all\nhis might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him,\nbroke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other\nend of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\n“She’s here!” shouted Dmitri. “I saw her turn towards the house just\nnow, but I couldn’t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?”\n\nThat shout, “She’s here!” produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor\nPavlovitch. All his terror left him.\n\n“Hold him! Hold him!” he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile\nGrigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and\nAlyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard\nto fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass\nvase—not an expensive one—on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset\nas he ran past it.\n\n“At him!” shouted the old man. “Help!”\n\nIvan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him\nback.\n\n“Why do you run after him? He’ll murder you outright,” Ivan cried\nwrathfully at his father.\n\n“Ivan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka’s here. He said he saw her\nhimself, running.”\n\nHe was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the\nsudden news that she was here made him beside himself. He was trembling\nall over. He seemed frantic.\n\n“But you’ve seen for yourself that she hasn’t come,” cried Ivan.\n\n“But she may have come by that other entrance.”\n\n“You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.”",
            "1": "Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing‐room. He had, of course,\nfound the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so\nGrushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.\n\n“Hold him!” shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again.\n“He’s been stealing money in my bedroom.” And tearing himself from Ivan\nhe rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly\nclutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his\ntemples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He\nkicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man\nmoaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms\nround him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him\nwith his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.\n\n“Madman! You’ve killed him!” cried Ivan.\n\n“Serve him right!” shouted Dmitri breathlessly. “If I haven’t killed\nhim, I’ll come again and kill him. You can’t protect him!”\n\n“Dmitri! Go away at once!” cried Alyosha commandingly.\n\n“Alexey! You tell me. It’s only you I can believe; was she here just\nnow, or not? I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the\nlane. I shouted, she ran away.”\n\n“I swear she’s not been here, and no one expected her.”\n\n“But I saw her.... So she must ... I’ll find out at once where she\nis.... Good‐by, Alexey! Not a word to Æsop about the money now. But go\nto Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, ‘He sends his\ncompliments to you!’ Compliments, his compliments! Just compliments and\nfarewell! Describe the scene to her.”\n\nMeanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an\narm‐chair. His face was covered with blood, but he was conscious and\nlistened greedily to Dmitri’s cries. He was still fancying that\nGrushenka really was somewhere in the house. Dmitri looked at him with\nhatred as he went out.\n\n“I don’t repent shedding your blood!” he cried. “Beware, old man,\nbeware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown\nyou altogether.”\n\nHe ran out of the room.\n\n“She’s here. She must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov!” the old man\nwheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him with his finger.\n\n“No, she’s not here, you old lunatic!” Ivan shouted at him angrily.\n“Here, he’s fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!”",
            "2": "Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and\nput him to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his head. Exhausted by\nthe brandy, by his violent emotion, and the blows he had received, he\nshut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow.\nIvan and Alyosha went back to the drawing‐room. Smerdyakov removed the\nfragments of the broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking\ngloomily at the floor.\n\n“Shouldn’t you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?”\nAlyosha said to him. “We’ll look after him. My brother gave you a\nterrible blow—on the head.”\n\n“He’s insulted me!” Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly.\n\n“He’s ‘insulted’ his father, not only you,” observed Ivan with a forced\nsmile.\n\n“I used to wash him in his tub. He’s insulted me,” repeated Grigory.\n\n“Damn it all, if I hadn’t pulled him away perhaps he’d have murdered\nhim. It wouldn’t take much to do for Æsop, would it?” whispered Ivan to\nAlyosha.\n\n“God forbid!” cried Alyosha.\n\n“Why should He forbid?” Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a\nmalignant grimace. “One reptile will devour the other. And serve them\nboth right, too.”\n\nAlyosha shuddered.\n\n“Of course I won’t let him be murdered as I didn’t just now. Stay here,\nAlyosha, I’ll go for a turn in the yard. My head’s begun to ache.”\n\nAlyosha went to his father’s bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the\nscreen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and\ngazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and\nmeditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement.\n\n“Alyosha,” he whispered apprehensively, “where’s Ivan?”\n\n“In the yard. He’s got a headache. He’s on the watch.”\n\n“Give me that looking‐glass. It stands over there. Give it me.”\n\nAlyosha gave him a little round folding looking‐glass which stood on\nthe chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was\nconsiderably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a\nrather large crimson bruise.\n\n“What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I’m afraid of Ivan.\nI’m more afraid of Ivan than the other. You’re the only one I’m not\nafraid of....”\n\n“Don’t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he’ll defend you.”\n\n“Alyosha, and what of the other? He’s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell\nme the truth, was she here just now or not?”\n\n“No one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.”\n\n“You know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.”\n\n“She won’t marry him.”",
            "3": "“She won’t. She won’t. She won’t. She won’t on any account!”\n\nThe old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more\ncomforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized\nAlyosha’s hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively\nglittered in his eyes.\n\n“That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,”\nhe said. “Take it home and keep it for yourself. And I’ll let you go\nback to the monastery.... I was joking this morning, don’t be angry\nwith me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an\nangel and tell me the truth!”\n\n“You’re still asking whether she has been here or not?” Alyosha said\nsorrowfully.\n\n“No, no, no. I believe you. I’ll tell you what it is: you go to\nGrushenka yourself, or see her somehow; make haste and ask her; see for\nyourself, which she means to choose, him or me. Eh? What? Can you?”\n\n“If I see her I’ll ask her,” Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.\n\n“No, she won’t tell you,” the old man interrupted, “she’s a rogue.\nShe’ll begin kissing you and say that it’s you she wants. She’s a\ndeceitful, shameless hussy. You mustn’t go to her, you mustn’t!”\n\n“No, father, and it wouldn’t be suitable, it wouldn’t be right at all.”\n\n“Where was he sending you just now? He shouted ‘Go’ as he ran away.”\n\n“To Katerina Ivanovna.”\n\n“For money? To ask her for money?”\n\n“No. Not for money.”\n\n“He’s no money; not a farthing. I’ll settle down for the night, and\nthink things over, and you can go. Perhaps you’ll meet her.... Only be\nsure to come to me to‐morrow in the morning. Be sure to. I have a word\nto say to you to‐morrow. Will you come?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“When you come, pretend you’ve come of your own accord to ask after me.\nDon’t tell any one I told you to. Don’t say a word to Ivan.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\n“Good‐by, my angel. You stood up for me, just now. I shall never forget\nit. I’ve a word to say to you to‐morrow—but I must think about it.”\n\n“And how do you feel now?”\n\n“I shall get up to‐morrow and go out, perfectly well, perfectly well!”\n\nCrossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the\ngateway. He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note‐book.\nAlyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and\nhad let him go back to sleep at the monastery.\n\n“Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to‐morrow morning,” said\nIvan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to\nAlyosha.",
            "4": "“I shall be at the Hohlakovs’ to‐morrow,” answered Alyosha, “I may be\nat Katerina Ivanovna’s, too, if I don’t find her now.”\n\n“But you’re going to her now, anyway? For that ‘compliments and\nfarewell,’ ” said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.\n\n“I think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what\nwent before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he—well, in\nfact—takes his leave of her?”\n\n“Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?”\nexclaimed Alyosha.\n\n“One can’t tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out.\nThat woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and\nnot let Dmitri in the house.”\n\n“Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at\nother men and decide which is worthy to live?”\n\n“Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided\nin men’s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for\nrights—who has not the right to wish?”\n\n“Not for another man’s death?”\n\n“What even if for another man’s death? Why lie to oneself since all men\nlive so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I\nsaid just now—that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let\nme ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Æsop’s\nblood, murdering him, eh?”\n\n“What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don’t\nthink Dmitri is capable of it, either.”\n\n“Thanks, if only for that,” smiled Ivan. “Be sure, I should always\ndefend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this\ncase. Good‐by till to‐morrow. Don’t condemn me, and don’t look on me as\na villain,” he added with a smile.\n\nThey shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt\nthat his brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had\ncertainly done this with some definite motive."

            "0": "Alyosha left his father’s house feeling even more exhausted and\ndejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed\nshattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put\ntogether the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the\nagonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He felt something\nbordering upon despair, which he had never known till then. Towering\nlike a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal, insoluble question:\nHow would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with\nthis terrible woman? Now he had himself been a witness of it, he had\nbeen present and seen them face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri\ncould be made unhappy, terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble\nawaiting him. It appeared too that there were other people concerned,\nfar more so than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was\nsomething positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step\ntowards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he\nfelt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women?\nStrange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna’s in\nthe greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the\ncontrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance\nfrom her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult\nthan before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably,\nand Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might\nsink to any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina\nIvanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father.\n\nIt was by now seven o’clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered\nthe very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by\nKaterina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One of\nthem, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half‐sister\nAgafya Ivanovna who had looked after her in her father’s house when she\ncame from boarding‐school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style\nand consequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that\nthey both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she\nonly kept them with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave\nway to no one but her benefactress, the general’s widow, who had been\nkept by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged to write twice a\nweek a full account of all her doings.",
            "1": "When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to\nhim to take his name up, it was evident that they were already aware of\nhis arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from the window. At least,\nAlyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and\nrustling skirts. Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room.\n\nAlyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such\nexcitement. He was conducted however to the drawing‐room at once. It\nwas a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all in\nprovincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and\nlittle tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on the\ntables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window. It was\ntwilight and rather dark. Alyosha made out a silk mantle thrown down on\nthe sofa, where people had evidently just been sitting; and on a table\nin front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate, cakes, a\nglass saucer with blue raisins, and another with sweetmeats. Alyosha\nsaw that he had interrupted visitors, and frowned. But at that instant\nthe portière was raised, and with rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina\nIvanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant\nsmile of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted\ncandles and set them on the table.\n\n“Thank God! At last you have come too! I’ve been simply praying for you\nall day! Sit down.”\n\nAlyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna’s beauty when, three weeks\nbefore, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna’s special\nrequest, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation\nbetween them at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very\nshy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him.\nAlyosha had been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He\nwas struck by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self‐confidence of the\nhaughty girl. And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not\nexaggerating it. He thought her great glowing black eyes were very\nfine, especially with her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But\nin those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was\nsomething with which his brother might well be passionately in love,\nbut which perhaps could not be loved for long. He expressed this\nthought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother\nbesought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on\nseeing his betrothed.",
            "2": "“You’ll be happy with her, but perhaps—not tranquilly happy.”\n\n“Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don’t\nyield to fate. So you think I shan’t love her for ever.”\n\n“No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you won’t always\nbe happy with her.”\n\nAlyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with\nhimself for having yielded to his brother’s entreaties and put such\n“foolish” ideas into words. For his opinion had struck him as awfully\nfoolish immediately after he had uttered it. He felt ashamed too of\nhaving given so confident an opinion about a woman. It was with the\nmore amazement that he felt now, at the first glance at Katerina\nIvanovna as she ran in to him, that he had perhaps been utterly\nmistaken. This time her face was beaming with spontaneous good‐natured\nkindliness, and direct warm‐hearted sincerity. The “pride and\nhaughtiness,” which had struck Alyosha so much before, was only\nbetrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of bright, strong\nfaith in herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance, at the first\nword, that all the tragedy of her position in relation to the man she\nloved so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps already knew\neverything, positively everything. And yet, in spite of that, there was\nsuch brightness in her face, such faith in the future. Alyosha felt at\nonce that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts. He was conquered\nand captivated immediately. Besides all this, he noticed at her first\nwords that she was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps quite\nexceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.\n\n“I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole\ntruth—from you and no one else.”\n\n“I have come,” muttered Alyosha confusedly, “I—he sent me.”",
            "3": "“Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know everything—everything!”\ncried Katerina Ivanovna, her eyes flashing. “Wait a moment, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, I’ll tell you why I’ve been so longing to see you. You\nsee, I know perhaps far more than you do yourself, and there’s no need\nfor you to tell me anything. I’ll tell you what I want from you. I want\nto know your own last impression of him. I want you to tell me most\ndirectly, plainly, coarsely even (oh, as coarsely as you like!), what\nyou thought of him just now and of his position after your meeting with\nhim to‐day. That will perhaps be better than if I had a personal\nexplanation with him, as he does not want to come to me. Do you\nunderstand what I want from you? Now, tell me simply, tell me every\nword of the message he sent you with (I knew he would send you).”\n\n“He told me to give you his compliments—and to say that he would never\ncome again—but to give you his compliments.”\n\n“His compliments? Was that what he said—his own expression?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word, perhaps he did not\nuse the right word?”\n\n“No; he told me precisely to repeat that word. He begged me two or\nthree times not to forget to say so.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna flushed hotly.\n\n“Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I’ll\ntell you what I think, and you must simply say whether it’s right or\nnot. Listen! If he had sent me his compliments in passing, without\ninsisting on your repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that\nwould be the end of everything! But if he particularly insisted on\nthose words, if he particularly told you not to forget to repeat them\nto me, then perhaps he was in excitement, beside himself. He had made\nhis decision and was frightened at it. He wasn’t walking away from me\nwith a resolute step, but leaping headlong. The emphasis on that phrase\nmay have been simply bravado.”\n\n“Yes, yes!” cried Alyosha warmly. “I believe that is it.”\n\n“And, if so, he’s not altogether lost. I can still save him. Stay! Did\nhe not tell you anything about money—about three thousand roubles?”\n\n“He did speak about it, and it’s that more than anything that’s\ncrushing him. He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters\nnow,” Alyosha answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his heart and\nbelieving that there really might be a way of escape and salvation for\nhis brother. “But do you know about the money?” he added, and suddenly\nbroke off.",
            "4": "“I’ve known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and\nheard long ago that the money had not arrived. He hadn’t sent the\nmoney, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he was still in need\nof money. My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to\nturn, and who was his true friend. No, he won’t recognize that I am his\ntruest friend; he won’t know me, and looks on me merely as a woman.\nI’ve been tormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him\nfrom being ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand. Let\nhim feel ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people’s\nknowing, but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without\nshame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready to\nbear for his sake? Why, why doesn’t he know me? How dare he not know me\nafter all that has happened? I want to save him for ever. Let him\nforget me as his betrothed. And here he fears that he is dishonored in\nmy eyes. Why, he wasn’t afraid to be open with you, Alexey\nFyodorovitch. How is it that I don’t deserve the same?”\n\nThe last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes.\n\n“I must tell you,” Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, “what\nhappened just now between him and my father.”\n\nAnd he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the\nmoney, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that\nhad again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments\nand farewell. “He went to that woman,” Alyosha added softly.\n\n“And do you suppose that I can’t put up with that woman? Does he think\nI can’t? But he won’t marry her,” she suddenly laughed nervously.\n“Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? It’s passion, not\nlove. He won’t marry her because she won’t marry him.” Again Katerina\nIvanovna laughed strangely.\n\n“He may marry her,” said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.",
            "5": "“He won’t marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know\nthat? Do you know that?” Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with\nextraordinary warmth. “She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic\ncreatures. I know how bewitching she is, but I know too that she is\nkind, firm and noble. Why do you look at me like that, Alexey\nFyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at my words, perhaps you don’t\nbelieve me? Agrafena Alexandrovna, my angel!” she cried suddenly to\nsome one, peeping into the next room, “come in to us. This is a friend.\nThis is Alyosha. He knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him.”\n\n“I’ve only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,” said a\nsoft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.",
            "6": "The portière was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming,\ncame up to the table. A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He fixed\nhis eyes on her and could not take them off. Here she was, that awful\nwoman, the “beast,” as Ivan had called her half an hour before. And yet\none would have thought the creature standing before him most simple and\nordinary, a good‐natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like\nother handsome ordinary women! It is true she was very, very\ngood‐looking with that Russian beauty so passionately loved by many\nmen. She was a rather tall woman, though a little shorter than Katerina\nIvanovna, who was exceptionally tall. She had a full figure, with soft,\nas it were, noiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar\nover‐sweetness, like her voice. She moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna,\nwith a vigorous, bold step, but noiselessly. Her feet made absolutely\nno sound on the floor. She sank softly into a low chair, softly\nrustling her sumptuous black silk dress, and delicately nestling her\nmilk‐white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl. She was\ntwenty‐two years old, and her face looked exactly that age. She was\nvery white in the face, with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The\nmodeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw\nwas set a trifle forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly\nprominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. But\nher magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable‐colored eyebrows\nand charming gray‐blue eyes with their long lashes would have made the\nmost indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the street,\nstop at the sight of her face and remember it long after. What struck\nAlyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature.\nThere was a childlike look in her eyes, a look of childish delight. She\ncame up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to expect\nsomething with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity. The light\nin her eyes gladdened the soul—Alyosha felt that. There was something\nelse in her which he could not understand, or would not have been able\nto define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him. It was\nthat softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that\ncatlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the\nshawl could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish\nbosom. Her figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though\nalready in somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined.\nConnoisseurs of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that\nthis fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of\nthirty, would “spread”; that the face would become puffy, and that\nwrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes;\nthe complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps—in fact, that it was\nthe beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so often met\nwith in Russian women. Alyosha, of course, did not think of this; but\nthough he was fascinated, yet he wondered with an unpleasant sensation,\nand as it were regretfully, why she drawled in that way and could not\nspeak naturally. She did so evidently feeling there was a charm in the\nexaggerated, honeyed modulation of the syllables. It was, of course,\nonly a bad, underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea\nof good manners. And yet this intonation and manner of speaking\nimpressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with the childishly\nsimple and happy expression of her face, the soft, babyish joy in her\neyes. Katerina Ivanovna at once made her sit down in an arm‐ chair\nfacing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her several times on her\nsmiling lips. She seemed quite in love with her.",
            "7": "“This is the first time we’ve met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said\nrapturously. “I wanted to know her, to see her. I wanted to go to her,\nbut I’d no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me. I knew we\nshould settle everything together—everything. My heart told me so—I was\nbegged not to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the\ndifficulty, and I was not mistaken. Grushenka has explained everything\nto me, told me all she means to do. She flew here like an angel of\ngoodness and brought us peace and joy.”\n\n“You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,” drawled\nGrushenka in her sing‐song voice, still with the same charming smile of\ndelight.\n\n“Don’t dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain\nyou! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more. It looks as though it\nwere swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how\nshe laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It does one’s heart good to see the\nangel.”\n\nAlyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down\nhim.\n\n“You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all\nworthy of your kindness.”\n\n“Not worthy! She’s not worthy of it!” Katerina Ivanovna cried again\nwith the same warmth. “You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we’re fanciful,\nwe’re self‐willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart. We’re\nnoble, we’re generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have\nonly been unfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an\nunworthy, perhaps, or fickle man. There was one man—one, an officer\ntoo, we loved him, we sacrificed everything to him. That was long ago,\nfive years ago, and he has forgotten us, he has married. Now he is a\nwidower, he has written, he is coming here, and, do you know, we’ve\nloved him, none but him, all this time, and we’ve loved him all our\nlife! He will come, and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last\nfive years she’s been wretched. But who can reproach her, who can boast\nof her favor? Only that bedridden old merchant, but he is more like her\nfather, her friend, her protector. He found her then in despair, in\nagony, deserted by the man she loved. She was ready to drown herself\nthen, but the old merchant saved her—saved her!”\n\n“You defend me very kindly, dear young lady. You are in a great hurry\nabout everything,” Grushenka drawled again.",
            "8": "“Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?\nGrushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little\nhand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! It has brought me happiness and\nhas lifted me up, and I’m going to kiss it, outside and inside, here,\nhere, here!”\n\nAnd three times she kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat,\nhand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture. She held out her hand with a\ncharming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the “sweet young lady,”\nand obviously liked having her hand kissed.\n\n“Perhaps there’s rather too much rapture,” thought Alyosha. He blushed.\nHe felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.\n\n“You won’t make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this\nbefore Alexey Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“Do you think I meant to make you blush?” said Katerina Ivanovna,\nsomewhat surprised. “Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!”\n\n“Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady.\nMaybe I’m not so good as I seem to you. I’ve a bad heart; I will have\nmy own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for\nfun.”\n\n“But now you’ll save him. You’ve given me your word. You’ll explain it\nall to him. You’ll break to him that you have long loved another man,\nwho is now offering you his hand.”\n\n“Oh, no! I didn’t give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking\nabout that. I didn’t give you my word.”\n\n“Then I didn’t quite understand you,” said Katerina Ivanovna slowly,\nturning a little pale. “You promised—”\n\n“Oh, no, angel lady, I’ve promised nothing,” Grushenka interrupted\nsoftly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression. “You\nsee at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with\nyou. If I want to do a thing I do it. I may have made you some promise\njust now. But now again I’m thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I\nliked him very much once—liked him for almost a whole hour. Now maybe I\nshall go and tell him to stay with me from this day forward. You see,\nI’m so changeable.”\n\n“Just now you said—something quite different,” Katerina Ivanovna\nwhispered faintly.\n\n“Ah, just now! But, you know. I’m such a soft‐hearted, silly creature.\nOnly think what he’s gone through on my account! What if when I go home\nI feel sorry for him? What then?”\n\n“I never expected—”",
            "9": "“Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now\nperhaps you won’t care for a silly creature like me, now you know my\ncharacter. Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,” she said\ntenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna’s hand.\n\n“Here, dear young lady, I’ll take your hand and kiss it as you did\nmine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three\nhundred times to be even with you. Well, but let that pass. And then it\nshall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want\nto do your bidding like a slave. Let it be as God wills, without any\nagreements and promises. What a sweet hand—what a sweet hand you have!\nYou sweet young lady, you incredible beauty!”\n\nShe slowly raised the hands to her lips, with the strange object indeed\nof “being even” with her in kisses.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna did not take her hand away. She listened with timid\nhope to the last words, though Grushenka’s promise to do her bidding\nlike a slave was very strangely expressed. She looked intently into her\neyes; she still saw in those eyes the same simple‐hearted, confiding\nexpression, the same bright gayety.\n\n“She’s perhaps too naïve,” thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of\nhope.\n\nGrushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the “sweet hand.” She\nraised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three\nminutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something.\n\n“Do you know, angel lady,” she suddenly drawled in an even more soft\nand sugary voice, “do you know, after all, I think I won’t kiss your\nhand?” And she laughed a little merry laugh.\n\n“As you please. What’s the matter with you?” said Katerina Ivanovna,\nstarting suddenly.\n\n“So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I\ndidn’t kiss yours.”\n\nThere was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness\nat Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n“Insolent creature!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly\ngrasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat.\n\nGrushenka too got up, but without haste.\n\n“So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn’t kiss yours\nat all. And how he will laugh!”\n\n“Vile slut! Go away!”\n\n“Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That’s unbecoming for you,\ndear young lady, a word like that.”\n\n“Go away! You’re a creature for sale!” screamed Katerina Ivanovna.\nEvery feature was working in her utterly distorted face.",
            "10": "“For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money\nonce; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha\nheld her with all his strength.\n\n“Not a step, not a word! Don’t speak, don’t answer her. She’ll go\naway—she’ll go at once.”\n\nAt that instant Katerina Ivanovna’s two aunts ran in at her cry, and\nwith them a maid‐servant. All hurried to her.\n\n“I will go away,” said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa.\n“Alyosha, darling, see me home!”\n\n“Go away—go away, make haste!” cried Alyosha, clasping his hands\nimploringly.\n\n“Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I’ve got a pretty little story to\ntell you on the way. I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See\nme home, dear, you’ll be glad of it afterwards.”\n\nAlyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the\nhouse, laughing musically.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was\nshaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her.\n\n“I warned you,” said the elder of her aunts. “I tried to prevent your\ndoing this. You’re too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You\ndon’t know these creatures, and they say she’s worse than any of them.\nYou are too self‐willed.”\n\n“She’s a tigress!” yelled Katerina Ivanovna. “Why did you hold me,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch? I’d have beaten her—beaten her!”\n\nShe could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she did not care\nto, indeed.\n\n“She ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!”\n\nAlyosha withdrew towards the door.\n\n“But, my God!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her hands. “He! He! He\ncould be so dishonorable, so inhuman! Why, he told that creature what\nhappened on that fatal, accursed day! ‘You brought your beauty for\nsale, dear young lady.’ She knows it! Your brother’s a scoundrel,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch.”\n\nAlyosha wanted to say something, but he couldn’t find a word. His heart\nached.\n\n“Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It’s shameful, it’s awful for me! To‐\nmorrow, I beg you on my knees, come to‐morrow. Don’t condemn me.\nForgive me. I don’t know what I shall do with myself now!”\n\nAlyosha walked out into the street reeling. He could have wept as she\ndid. Suddenly he was overtaken by the maid.\n\n“The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov;\nit’s been left with us since dinner‐time.”\n\nAlyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost\nunconsciously, into his pocket."

            "0": "It was not much more than three‐quarters of a mile from the town to the\nmonastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour\ndeserted. It was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at\nthirty paces ahead. There were cross‐roads half‐way. A figure came into\nsight under a solitary willow at the cross‐roads. As soon as Alyosha\nreached the cross‐ roads the figure moved out and rushed at him,\nshouting savagely:\n\n“Your money or your life!”\n\n“So it’s you, Mitya,” cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled\nhowever.\n\n“Ha ha ha! You didn’t expect me? I wondered where to wait for you. By\nher house? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you.\nAt last I thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here, there’s no\nother way to the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a\nbeetle. But what’s the matter?”\n\n“Nothing, brother—it’s the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father’s\nblood just now.” (Alyosha began to cry, he had been on the verge of\ntears for a long time, and now something seemed to snap in his soul.)\n“You almost killed him—cursed him—and now—here—you’re making\njokes—‘Your money or your life!’ ”\n\n“Well, what of that? It’s not seemly—is that it? Not suitable in my\nposition?”\n\n“No—I only—”\n\n“Stay. Look at the night. You see what a dark night, what clouds, what\na wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you. And as\nGod’s above, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what\nis there to wait for? Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I\ncan twist them into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go\non burdening the earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence? And then\nI heard you coming—Heavens, it was as though something flew down to me\nsuddenly. So there is a man, then, whom I love. Here he is, that man,\nmy dear little brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the\nonly one I love in the world. And I loved you so much, so much at that\nmoment that I thought, ‘I’ll fall on his neck at once.’ Then a stupid\nidea struck me, to have a joke with you and scare you. I shouted, like\na fool, ‘Your money!’ Forgive my foolery—it was only nonsense, and\nthere’s nothing unseemly in my soul.... Damn it all, tell me what’s\nhappened. What did she say? Strike me, crush me, don’t spare me! Was\nshe furious?”\n\n“No, not that.... There was nothing like that, Mitya. There—I found\nthem both there.”\n\n“Both? Whom?”\n\n“Grushenka at Katerina Ivanovna’s.”\n\nDmitri was struck dumb.",
            "1": "“Impossible!” he cried. “You’re raving! Grushenka with her?”\n\nAlyosha described all that had happened from the moment he went in to\nKaterina Ivanovna’s. He was ten minutes telling his story. He can’t be\nsaid to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he seemed to make\nit clear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly\ndescribing, often in one word, his own sensations. Dmitri listened in\nsilence, gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to\nAlyosha that he understood it all, and had grasped every point. But as\nthe story went on, his face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He\nscowled, he clenched his teeth, and his fixed stare became still more\nrigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible\nrapidity, his wrathful, savage face changed, his tightly compressed\nlips parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled,\nspontaneous laughter. He literally shook with laughter. For a long time\nhe could not speak.\n\n“So she wouldn’t kiss her hand! So she didn’t kiss it; so she ran\naway!” he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it\nmight have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous. “So the\nother one called her tigress! And a tigress she is! So she ought to be\nflogged on a scaffold? Yes, yes, so she ought. That’s just what I\nthink; she ought to have been long ago. It’s like this, brother, let\nher be punished, but I must get better first. I understand the queen of\nimpudence. That’s her all over! You saw her all over in that\nhand‐kissing, the she‐devil! She’s magnificent in her own line! So she\nran home? I’ll go—ah—I’ll run to her! Alyosha, don’t blame me, I agree\nthat hanging is too good for her.”\n\n“But Katerina Ivanovna!” exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.",
            "2": "“I see her, too! I see right through her, as I’ve never done before!\nIt’s a regular discovery of the four continents of the world, that is,\nof the five! What a thing to do! That’s just like Katya, who was not\nafraid to face a coarse, unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on\na generous impulse to save her father! But the pride, the recklessness,\nthe defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried\nto stop her? That aunt, you know, is overbearing, herself. She’s the\nsister of the general’s widow in Moscow, and even more stuck‐up than\nshe. But her husband was caught stealing government money. He lost\neverything, his estate and all, and the proud wife had to lower her\ncolors, and hasn’t raised them since. So she tried to prevent Katya,\nbut she wouldn’t listen to her! She thinks she can overcome everything,\nthat everything will give way to her. She thought she could bewitch\nGrushenka if she liked, and she believed it herself: she plays a part\nto herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka’s\nhand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by\nGrushenka, that’s to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her\nown delusion—because it was _her_ dream, _her_ delusion! Alyosha,\ndarling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up\nyour cassock and run? Ha ha ha!”\n\n“Brother, you don’t seem to have noticed how you’ve insulted Katerina\nIvanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her\nface just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her\nbeauty! Brother, what could be worse than that insult?”\n\nWhat worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it\nseemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna’s\nhumiliation.\n\n“Bah!” Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand.\nHe only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the\ninsult, and Katerina Ivanovna’s cry: “Your brother is a scoundrel!”\n\n“Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that ‘fatal day,’ as\nKatya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at\nMokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing. I\nwas sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya’s image, and Grushenka\nunderstood it. She understood it all then. I remember, she cried\nherself.... Damn it all! But it’s bound to be so now.... Then she\ncried, but now ‘the dagger in the heart’! That’s how women are.”\n\nHe looked down and sank into thought.",
            "3": "“Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!” he said suddenly, in a\ngloomy voice. “It doesn’t matter whether I cried or not, I’m a\nscoundrel! Tell her I accept the name, if that’s any comfort. Come,\nthat’s enough. Good‐by. It’s no use talking! It’s not amusing. You go\nyour way and I mine. And I don’t want to see you again except as a last\nresource. Good‐ by, Alexey!”\n\nHe warmly pressed Alyosha’s hand, and still looking down, without\nraising his head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly\ntowards the town.\n\nAlyosha looked after him, unable to believe he would go away so\nabruptly.\n\n“Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!” cried Dmitri,\nsuddenly turning back. “Look at me. Look at me well. You see here,\nhere—there’s terrible disgrace in store for me.” (As he said “here,”\nDmitri struck his chest with his fist with a strange air, as though the\ndishonor lay precisely on his chest, in some spot, in a pocket,\nperhaps, or hanging round his neck.) “You know me now, a scoundrel, an\navowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I’ve never done anything\nbefore and never shall again, anything that can compare in baseness\nwith the dishonor which I bear now at this very minute on my breast,\nhere, here, which will come to pass, though I’m perfectly free to stop\nit. I can stop it or carry it through, note that. Well, let me tell\nyou, I shall carry it through. I shan’t stop it. I told you everything\njust now, but I didn’t tell you this, because even I had not brass\nenough for it. I can still pull up; if I do, I can give back the full\nhalf of my lost honor to‐morrow. But I shan’t pull up. I shall carry\nout my base plan, and you can bear witness that I told you so\nbeforehand. Darkness and destruction! No need to explain. You’ll find\nout in due time. The filthy back‐alley and the she‐ devil. Good‐by.\nDon’t pray for me, I’m not worth it. And there’s no need, no need at\nall.... I don’t need it! Away!”\n\nAnd he suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the\nmonastery.\n\n“What? I shall never see him again! What is he saying?” he wondered\nwildly. “Why, I shall certainly see him to‐morrow. I shall look him up.\nI shall make a point of it. What does he mean?”\n\n\nHe went round the monastery, and crossed the pine‐wood to the\nhermitage. The door was opened to him, though no one was admitted at\nthat hour. There was a tremor in his heart as he went into Father\nZossima’s cell.",
            "4": "“Why, why, had he gone forth? Why had he sent him into the world? Here\nwas peace. Here was holiness. But there was confusion, there was\ndarkness in which one lost one’s way and went astray at once....”\n\nIn the cell he found the novice Porfiry and Father Païssy, who came\nevery hour to inquire after Father Zossima. Alyosha learnt with alarm\nthat he was getting worse and worse. Even his usual discourse with the\nbrothers could not take place that day. As a rule every evening after\nservice the monks flocked into Father Zossima’s cell, and all confessed\naloud their sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations;\neven their disputes, if there had been any. Some confessed kneeling.\nThe elder absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and\ndismissed them. It was against this general “confession” that the\nopponents of “elders” protested, maintaining that it was a profanation\nof the sacrament of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was\nquite a different thing. They even represented to the diocesan\nauthorities that such confessions attained no good object, but actually\nto a large extent led to sin and temptation. Many of the brothers\ndisliked going to the elder, and went against their own will because\nevery one went, and for fear they should be accused of pride and\nrebellious ideas. People said that some of the monks agreed beforehand,\nsaying, “I’ll confess I lost my temper with you this morning, and you\nconfirm it,” simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew\nthat this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were\namong the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from\nrelations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read by\nhim before those to whom they were addressed.",
            "5": "It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good\nfaith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in\nfact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was\nfalse and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced\nof the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that “for those who have\ncome within these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and\nsacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on\nthe other hand, who find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and\nhave made a mistake in entering the monastery—their proper place is in\nthe world. Even in the temple one cannot be safe from sin and the\ndevil. So it was no good taking it too much into account.”\n\n“He is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him,” Father Païssy whispered\nto Alyosha, as he blessed him. “It’s difficult to rouse him. And he\nmust not be roused. He waked up for five minutes, sent his blessing to\nthe brothers, and begged their prayers for him at night. He intends to\ntake the sacrament again in the morning. He remembered you, Alexey. He\nasked whether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the\ntown. ‘I blessed him for that work,’ he said, ‘his place is there, not\nhere, for awhile.’ Those were his words about you. He remembered you\nlovingly, with anxiety; do you understand how he honored you? But how\nis it that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world?\nHe must have foreseen something in your destiny! Understand, Alexey,\nthat if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty laid upon\nyou by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.”\n\nFather Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was\ndying, though he might live another day or two. Alyosha firmly and\nardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father, the\nHohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he would not leave the monastery next\nday, but would remain with his elder to the end. His heart glowed with\nlove, and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one\ninstant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his\ndeathbed, and whom he honored above every one in the world. He went\ninto Father Zossima’s bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground\nbefore the elder, who slept quietly without stirring, with regular,\nhardly audible breathing and a peaceful face.",
            "6": "Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received\nhis guests in the morning. Taking off his boots, he lay down on the\nhard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he had long used as a bed, bringing\nnothing but a pillow. The mattress, about which his father had shouted\nto him that morning, he had long forgotten to lie on. He took off his\ncassock, which he used as a covering. But before going to bed, he fell\non his knees and prayed a long time. In his fervent prayer he did not\nbeseech God to lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous\nemotion, which always visited his soul after the praise and adoration,\nof which his evening prayer usually consisted. That joy always brought\nhim light untroubled sleep. As he was praying, he suddenly felt in his\npocket the little pink note the servant had handed him as he left\nKaterina Ivanovna’s. He was disturbed, but finished his prayer. Then,\nafter some hesitation, he opened the envelope. In it was a letter to\nhim, signed by Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had\nlaughed at him before the elder in the morning.\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she wrote, “I am writing to you without any\none’s knowledge, even mamma’s, and I know how wrong it is. But I cannot\nlive without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart,\nand this no one but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say\nwhat I want so much to tell you? Paper, they say, does not blush, but I\nassure you it’s not true and that it’s blushing just as I am now, all\nover. Dear Alyosha, I love you, I’ve loved you from my childhood, since\nour Moscow days, when you were very different from what you are now,\nand I shall love you all my life. My heart has chosen you, to unite our\nlives, and pass them together till our old age. Of course, on condition\nthat you will leave the monastery. As for our age we will wait for the\ntime fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong,\nI shall be walking and dancing. There can be no doubt of that.\n\n“You see how I’ve thought of everything. There’s only one thing I can’t\nimagine: what you’ll think of me when you read this. I’m always\nlaughing and being naughty. I made you angry this morning, but I assure\nyou before I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of\nGod, and now I’m praying, and almost crying.",
            "7": "“My secret is in your hands. When you come to‐morrow, I don’t know how\nI shall look at you. Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can’t restrain\nmyself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to‐day.\nYou’ll think I’m a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won’t believe\nmy letter. And so I beg you, dear one, if you’ve any pity for me, when\nyou come to‐ morrow, don’t look me straight in the face, for if I meet\nyour eyes, it will be sure to make me laugh, especially as you’ll be in\nthat long gown. I feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you\ncome, don’t look at me at all for a time, look at mamma or at the\nwindow....\n\n“Here I’ve written you a love‐letter. Oh, dear, what have I done?\nAlyosha, don’t despise me, and if I’ve done something very horrid and\nwounded you, forgive me. Now the secret of my reputation, ruined\nperhaps for ever, is in your hands.\n\n“I shall certainly cry to‐day. Good‐by till our meeting, our _awful_\nmeeting.—LISE.\n\n“P.S.—Alyosha! You must, must, must come!—LISE.”\n\nAlyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought a\nlittle, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh. He started. That\nlaugh seemed to him sinful. But a minute later he laughed again just as\nsoftly and happily. He slowly replaced the note in the envelope,\ncrossed himself and lay down. The agitation in his heart passed at\nonce. “God, have mercy upon all of them, have all these unhappy and\nturbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set them in the right path. All\nways are Thine. Save them according to Thy wisdom. Thou art love. Thou\nwilt send joy to all!” Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling\ninto peaceful sleep.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nBook IV. Lacerations"

            "0": "Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak. Father Zossima woke up\nfeeling very weak, though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a\nchair. His mind was quite clear; his face looked very tired, yet bright\nand almost joyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and\ncordiality. “Maybe I shall not live through the coming day,” he said to\nAlyosha. Then he desired to confess and take the sacrament at once. He\nalways confessed to Father Païssy. After taking the communion, the\nservice of extreme unction followed. The monks assembled and the cell\nwas gradually filled up by the inmates of the hermitage. Meantime it\nwas daylight. People began coming from the monastery. After the service\nwas over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one. As the\ncell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for\nothers. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his\narm‐chair. He talked as much as he could. Though his voice was weak, it\nwas fairly steady.\n\n“I’ve been teaching you so many years, and therefore I’ve been talking\naloud so many years, that I’ve got into the habit of talking, and so\nmuch so that it’s almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than\nto talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,”\nhe jested, looking with emotion at the group round him.\n\nAlyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them. But\nthough he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady, his\nspeech was somewhat disconnected. He spoke of many things, he seemed\nanxious before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in\nhis life, and not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as\nthough thirsting to share with all men and all creation his joy and\necstasy, and once more in his life to open his whole heart.",
            "1": "“Love one another, Fathers,” said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha\ncould remember afterwards. “Love God’s people. Because we have come\nhere and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those\nthat are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming\nhere, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others,\nthan all men on earth.... And the longer the monk lives in his\nseclusion, the more keenly he must recognize that. Else he would have\nhad no reason to come here. When he realizes that he is not only worse\nthan others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and\neverything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the\naim of our seclusion is attained. For know, dear ones, that every one\nof us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth,\nnot merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one\npersonally for all mankind and every individual man. This knowledge is\nthe crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a\nspecial sort of men, but only what all men ought to be. Only through\nthat knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal,\ninexhaustible love. Then every one of you will have the power to win\nover the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world\nwith your tears.... Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess\nyour sins to yourself unceasingly. Be not afraid of your sins, even\nwhen perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no\nconditions with God. Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the\nlittle nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you,\nwho abuse and slander you. Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil,\nthe materialists—and I mean not only the good ones—for there are many\ngood ones among them, especially in our day—hate not even the wicked\nones. Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who\nhave none to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray. And\nadd: it is not in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower\nthan all men.... Love God’s people, let not strangers draw away the\nflock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or\nworse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw\naway your flock. Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be\nnot extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them....\nHave faith. Cling to the banner and raise it on high.”",
            "2": "But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his words\nafterwards. Sometimes he broke off altogether, as though to take\nbreath, and recover his strength, but he was in a sort of ecstasy. They\nheard him with emotion, though many wondered at his words and found\nthem obscure.... Afterwards all remembered those words.\n\nWhen Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he was struck by\nthe general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding\nabout it. This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others\nby devout solemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen\nimmediately after the elder’s death. Their suspense was, from one point\nof view, almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were\naffected by it. Father Païssy’s face looked the gravest of all.\n\nAlyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had\narrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov.\nIn it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It\nappeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to\nreceive Father Zossima’s blessing, there had been an old woman from the\ntown, a sergeant’s widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether\nshe might pray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had\ngone to Irkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which\nFather Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and\nsaying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind\nof sorcery. He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and\nadded, “as though reading the book of the future” (this was Madame\nHohlakov’s expression), words of comfort: “that her son Vassya was\ncertainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a\nletter, and that she was to go home and expect him.” And “Would you\nbelieve it?” exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, “the prophecy\nhas been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that.” Scarcely had\nthe old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from Siberia\nwhich had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in the letter\nwritten on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his mother\nthat he was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks\nafter her receiving the letter he hoped “to embrace his mother.”",
            "3": "Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new “miracle of\nprediction” to the Superior and all the brotherhood. “All, all, ought\nto know of it!” she concluded. The letter had been written in haste,\nthe excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But\nAlyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already.\nRakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his message “to inform\nmost respectfully his reverence Father Païssy, that he, Rakitin, has a\nmatter to speak of with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it\nfor a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.” As the\nmonk had given the message to Father Païssy before that to Alyosha, the\nlatter found after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him\nto do but to hand it to Father Païssy in confirmation of the story.\n\nAnd even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read\nthe news of the “miracle,” could not completely restrain some inner\nemotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his\nlips.\n\n“We shall see greater things!” broke from him.\n\n“We shall see greater things, greater things yet!” the monks around\nrepeated.\n\nBut Father Païssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a\ntime, not to speak of the matter “till it be more fully confirmed,\nseeing there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed\nthis might well have chanced naturally,” he added, prudently, as it\nwere to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own\ndisavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived.\n\nWithin the hour the “miracle” was of course known to the whole\nmonastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed\nmore impressed by it than the monk who had come the day before from St.\nSylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It\nwas he who had been standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and\nhad asked Father Zossima earnestly, referring to the “healing” of the\nlady’s daughter, “How can you presume to do such things?”",
            "4": "He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The\nevening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind\nthe apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit.\nThis Father Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and\nobserving silence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to\nFather Zossima and the whole institution of “elders,” which he regarded\nas a pernicious and frivolous innovation. He was a very formidable\nopponent, although from his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a\nword to any one. What made him formidable was that a number of monks\nfully shared his feeling, and many of the visitors looked upon him as a\ngreat saint and ascetic, although they had no doubt that he was crazy.\nBut it was just his craziness attracted them.\n\nFather Ferapont never went to see the elder. Though he lived in the\nhermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations, and this too\nbecause he behaved as though he were crazy. He was seventy‐five or\nmore, and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying\nwooden cell which had been built long ago for another great ascetic,\nFather Iona, who had lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose\nsaintly doings many curious stories were still extant in the monastery\nand the neighborhood.",
            "5": "Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same\nsolitary cell seven years previously. It was simply a peasant’s hut,\nthough it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary\nnumber of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them—which men\nbrought to the monastery as offerings to God. Father Ferapont had been\nappointed to look after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said\n(and indeed it was true) that he ate only two pounds of bread in three\ndays. The beekeeper, who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him\nthe bread every three days, and even to this man who waited upon him,\nFather Ferapont rarely uttered a word. The four pounds of bread,\ntogether with the sacrament bread, regularly sent him on Sundays after\nthe late mass by the Father Superior, made up his weekly rations. The\nwater in his jug was changed every day. He rarely appeared at mass.\nVisitors who came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day\nlong at prayer without looking round. If he addressed them, he was\nbrief, abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. On very rare occasions,\nhowever, he would talk to visitors, but for the most part he would\nutter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no\nentreaties would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation. He was\nnot a priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief, chiefly\nhowever among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had communication\nwith heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and so was\nsilent with men.\n\nThe monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the\nbeekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the\ncorner where Father Ferapont’s cell stood. “Maybe he will speak as you\nare a stranger and maybe you’ll get nothing out of him,” the beekeeper\nhad warned him. The monk, as he related afterwards, approached in the\nutmost apprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont\nwas sitting at the door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was\nlightly rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air.\nThe monk from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his\nblessing.\n\n“Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?” said Father Ferapont. “Get\nup!”\n\nThe monk got up.\n\n“Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from?”",
            "6": "What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict\nfasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man.\nHe was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy\nface. There was no doubt he still had considerable strength. He was of\nathletic build. In spite of his great age he was not even quite gray,\nand still had very thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once\nbeen black. His eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly\nprominent. He spoke with a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant’s\nlong reddish coat of coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and\nhad a stout rope round his waist. His throat and chest were bare.\nBeneath his coat, his shirt of the coarsest linen showed almost black\nwith dirt, not having been changed for months. They said that he wore\nirons weighing thirty pounds under his coat. His stockingless feet were\nthrust in old slippers almost dropping to pieces.\n\n“From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,” the monk\nanswered humbly, whilst his keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened\nlittle eyes kept watch on the hermit.\n\n“I have been at your Sylvester’s. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester\nwell?”\n\nThe monk hesitated.\n\n“You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?”",
            "7": "“Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules. During Lent\nthere are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For\nTuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild\nberries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout. On Saturday white\ncabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays\nwe have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage soup. From Monday till\nSaturday evening, six whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and\nwe have only bread and water, and that sparingly; if possible not\ntaking food every day, just the same as is ordered for first week in\nLent. On Good Friday nothing is eaten. In the same way on the Saturday\nwe have to fast till three o’clock, and then take a little bread and\nwater and drink a single cup of wine. On Holy Thursday we drink wine\nand have something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as\nthe Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: ‘It is unseemly by\nremitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole of Lent!’\nThis is how we keep the fast. But what is that compared with you, holy\nFather,” added the monk, growing more confident, “for all the year\nround, even at Easter, you take nothing but bread and water, and what\nwe should eat in two days lasts you full seven. It’s truly\nmarvelous—your great abstinence.”\n\n“And mushrooms?” asked Father Ferapont, suddenly.\n\n“Mushrooms?” repeated the surprised monk.\n\n“Yes. I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away\ninto the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but\nthey can’t give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to\nthe devil. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such\nfasting. Haughty and unclean is their judgment.”\n\n“Och, true,” sighed the monk.\n\n“And have you seen devils among them?” asked Ferapont.\n\n“Among them? Among whom?” asked the monk, timidly.\n\n“I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven’t\nbeen since. I saw a devil sitting on one man’s chest hiding under his\ncassock, only his horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his\npocket with such sharp eyes, he was afraid of me; another settled in\nthe unclean belly of one, another was hanging round a man’s neck, and\nso he was carrying him about without seeing him.”\n\n“You—can see spirits?” the monk inquired.",
            "8": "“I tell you I can see, I can see through them. When I was coming out\nfrom the Superior’s I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big\none, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and\nthe tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and\nslammed the door, pinching his tail in it. He squealed and began to\nstruggle, and I made the sign of the cross over him three times. And he\ndied on the spot like a crushed spider. He must have rotted there in\nthe corner and be stinking, but they don’t see, they don’t smell it.\nIt’s a year since I have been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a\nstranger.”\n\n“Your words are terrible! But, holy and blessed Father,” said the monk,\ngrowing bolder and bolder, “is it true, as they noise abroad even to\ndistant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with\nthe Holy Ghost?”\n\n“He does fly down at times.”\n\n“How does he fly down? In what form?”\n\n“As a bird.”\n\n“The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?”\n\n“There’s the Holy Ghost and there’s the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit\ncan appear as other birds—sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch\nand sometimes as a blue‐tit.”\n\n“How do you know him from an ordinary tit?”\n\n“He speaks.”\n\n“How does he speak, in what language?”\n\n“Human language.”\n\n“And what does he tell you?”\n\n“Why, to‐day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me\nunseemly questions. You want to know too much, monk.”\n\n“Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,” the monk shook\nhis head. But there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eyes.\n\n“Do you see this tree?” asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.\n\n“I do, blessed Father.”\n\n“You think it’s an elm, but for me it has another shape.”\n\n“What sort of shape?” inquired the monk, after a pause of vain\nexpectation.\n\n“It happens at night. You see those two branches? In the night it is\nChrist holding out His arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see\nit clearly and tremble. It’s terrible, terrible!”\n\n“What is there terrible if it’s Christ Himself?”\n\n“Why, He’ll snatch me up and carry me away.”\n\n“Alive?”\n\n“In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven’t you heard? He will take me\nin His arms and bear me away.”",
            "9": "Though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the\nbrothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he still cherished at\nheart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima.\nHe was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one\nwho kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should “see marvels.” His\nwords seemed certainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden\nin those words, and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in\nthose who have sacrificed their intellects for the glory of God? The\npinching of the devil’s tail he was ready and eager to believe, and not\nonly in the figurative sense. Besides he had, before visiting the\nmonastery, a strong prejudice against the institution of “elders,”\nwhich he only knew of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious\ninnovation. Before he had been long at the monastery, he had detected\nthe secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the\ninstitution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked\nhis nose into everything. This was why the news of the fresh “miracle”\nperformed by Father Zossima reduced him to extreme perplexity. Alyosha\nremembered afterwards how their inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been\ncontinually flitting to and fro from one group to another, listening\nand asking questions among the monks that were crowding within and\nwithout the elder’s cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at\nthe time, and only recollected it afterwards.\n\nHe had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima,\nfeeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he\nwas closing his eyes, and sent for him. Alyosha ran at once. There was\nno one else in the cell but Father Païssy, Father Iosif, and the novice\nPorfiry. The elder, opening his weary eyes and looking intently at\nAlyosha, asked him suddenly:\n\n“Are your people expecting you, my son?”\n\nAlyosha hesitated.\n\n“Haven’t they need of you? Didn’t you promise some one yesterday to see\nthem to‐day?”\n\n“I did promise—to my father—my brothers—others too.”\n\n“You see, you must go. Don’t grieve. Be sure I shall not die without\nyour being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my\nson, it will be my last gift to you. To you, dear son, because you love\nme. But now go to keep your promise.”",
            "10": "Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go. But the promise\nthat he should hear his last word on earth, that it should be the last\ngift to him, Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his soul. He\nmade haste that he might finish what he had to do in the town and\nreturn quickly. Father Païssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation\nwhich moved and surprised him greatly. He spoke as they left the cell\ntogether.\n\n“Remember, young man, unceasingly,” Father Païssy began, without\npreface, “that the science of this world, which has become a great\npower, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything divine\nhanded down to us in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the\nlearned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old.\nBut they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and\nindeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole still stands\nsteadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall not prevail\nagainst it. Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it not still a\nliving, a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of\npeople? It is still as strong and living even in the souls of atheists,\nwho have destroyed everything! For even those who have renounced\nChristianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the\nChristian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of\ntheir hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of\nvirtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been\nattempted, the result has been only grotesque. Remember this\nespecially, young man, since you are being sent into the world by your\ndeparting elder. Maybe, remembering this great day, you will not forget\nmy words, uttered from the heart for your guidance, seeing you are\nyoung, and the temptations of the world are great and beyond your\nstrength to endure. Well, now go, my orphan.”",
            "11": "With these words Father Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left the\nmonastery and thought them over, he suddenly realized that he had met a\nnew and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere\nmonk who had hitherto treated him sternly. It was as though Father\nZossima had bequeathed him to him at his death, and “perhaps that’s\njust what had passed between them,” Alyosha thought suddenly. The\nphilosophic reflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to\nthe warmth of Father Païssy’s heart. He was in haste to arm the boy’s\nmind for conflict with temptation and to guard the young soul left in\nhis charge with the strongest defense he could imagine."

            "0": "First of all, Alyosha went to his father. On the way he remembered that\nhis father had insisted the day before that he should come without his\nbrother Ivan seeing him. “Why so?” Alyosha wondered suddenly. “Even if\nmy father has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen?\nMost likely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something\ndifferent,” he decided. Yet he was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who\nopened the garden gate to him (Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in\nthe lodge), told him in answer to his question that Ivan Fyodorovitch\nhad gone out two hours ago.\n\n“And my father?”\n\n“He is up, taking his coffee,” Marfa answered somewhat dryly.\n\nAlyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing\nslippers and a little old overcoat. He was amusing himself by looking\nthrough some accounts, rather inattentively however. He was quite alone\nin the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing. Though he had\ngot up early and was trying to put a bold face on it, he looked tired\nand weak. His forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out\nduring the night, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his nose too\nhad swollen terribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it\nin patches, giving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable\nlook. The old man was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on\nAlyosha as he came in.\n\n“The coffee is cold,” he cried harshly; “I won’t offer you any. I’ve\nordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to‐day, and I don’t invite any\none to share it. Why have you come?”\n\n“To find out how you are,” said Alyosha.\n\n“Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It’s all of no\nconsequence. You need not have troubled. But I knew you’d come poking\nin directly.”\n\nHe said this with almost hostile feeling. At the same time he got up\nand looked anxiously in the looking‐glass (perhaps for the fortieth\ntime that morning) at his nose. He began, too, binding his red\nhandkerchief more becomingly on his forehead.\n\n“Red’s better. It’s just like the hospital in a white one,” he observed\nsententiously. “Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?”\n\n“He is very bad; he may die to‐day,” answered Alyosha. But his father\nhad not listened, and had forgotten his own question at once.\n\n“Ivan’s gone out,” he said suddenly. “He is doing his utmost to carry\noff Mitya’s betrothed. That’s what he is staying here for,” he added\nmaliciously, and, twisting his mouth, looked at Alyosha.",
            "1": "“Surely he did not tell you so?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“Yes, he did, long ago. Would you believe it, he told me three weeks\nago? You don’t suppose he too came to murder me, do you? He must have\nhad some object in coming.”\n\n“What do you mean? Why do you say such things?” said Alyosha, troubled.\n\n“He doesn’t ask for money, it’s true, but yet he won’t get a farthing\nfrom me. I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my\ndear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and the longer\nI live, the more I shall need it,” he continued, pacing from one corner\nof the room to the other, keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose\ngreasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material. “I can still pass for a\nman at five and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty\nyears. As I get older, you know, I shan’t be a pretty object. The\nwenches won’t come to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money.\nSo I am saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey\nFyodorovitch. You may as well know. For I mean to go on in my sins to\nthe end, let me tell you. For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men\nlive in it, only others do it on the sly, and I openly. And so all the\nother sinners fall upon me for being so simple. And your paradise,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it’s\nnot the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists.\nI believe that I fall asleep and don’t wake up again, and that’s all.\nYou can pray for my soul if you like. And if you don’t want to, don’t,\ndamn you! That’s my philosophy. Ivan talked well here yesterday, though\nwe were all drunk. Ivan is a conceited coxcomb, but he has no\nparticular learning ... nor education either. He sits silent and smiles\nat one without speaking—that’s what pulls him through.”\n\nAlyosha listened to him in silence.\n\n“Why won’t he talk to me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your\nIvan is a scoundrel! And I’ll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to.\nFor if you’ve money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing\nand you can have it. That’s what Ivan is afraid of, he is on the watch\nto prevent me getting married and that’s why he is egging on Mitya to\nmarry Grushenka himself. He hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that (as\nthough I should leave him my money if I don’t marry her!). Besides if\nMitya marries Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his rich betrothed, that’s\nwhat he’s reckoning on! He is a scoundrel, your Ivan!”",
            "2": "“How cross you are! It’s because of yesterday; you had better lie\ndown,” said Alyosha.\n\n“There! you say that,” the old man observed suddenly, as though it had\nstruck him for the first time, “and I am not angry with you. But if\nIvan said it, I should be angry with him. It is only with you I have\ngood moments, else you know I am an ill‐natured man.”\n\n“You are not ill‐natured, but distorted,” said Alyosha with a smile.\n\n“Listen. I meant this morning to get that ruffian Mitya locked up and I\ndon’t know now what I shall decide about it. Of course in these\nfashionable days fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice,\nbut even now the law does not allow you to drag your old father about\nby the hair, to kick him in the face in his own house, and brag of\nmurdering him outright—all in the presence of witnesses. If I liked, I\ncould crush him and could have him locked up at once for what he did\nyesterday.”\n\n“Then you don’t mean to take proceedings?”\n\n“Ivan has dissuaded me. I shouldn’t care about Ivan, but there’s\nanother thing.”\n\nAnd bending down to Alyosha, he went on in a confidential half‐whisper.\n\n“If I send the ruffian to prison, she’ll hear of it and run to see him\nat once. But if she hears that he has beaten me, a weak old man, within\nan inch of my life, she may give him up and come to me.... For that’s\nher way, everything by contraries. I know her through and through!\nWon’t you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I’ll pour a\nquarter of a glass of brandy into it, it’s delicious, my boy.”\n\n“No, thank you. I’ll take that roll with me if I may,” said Alyosha,\nand taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his\ncassock. “And you’d better not have brandy, either,” he suggested\napprehensively, looking into the old man’s face.\n\n“You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them.\nOnly one little glass. I’ll get it out of the cupboard.”\n\nHe unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the\ncupboard and put the key back in his pocket.\n\n“That’s enough. One glass won’t kill me.”\n\n“You see you are in a better humor now,” said Alyosha, smiling.",
            "3": "“Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a\nscoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya—why is that? He wants to\nspy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels!\nBut I don’t recognize Ivan, I don’t know him at all. Where does he come\nfrom? He is not one of us in soul. As though I’d leave him anything! I\nshan’t leave a will at all, you may as well know. And I’ll crush Mitya\nlike a beetle. I squash black‐beetles at night with my slipper; they\nsquelch when you tread on them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_\nMitya, for you love him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your\nloving him. But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his\nloving him. But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like\nIvan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust. When the\nwind blows, the dust will be gone.... I had a silly idea in my head\nwhen I told you to come to‐day; I wanted to find out from you about\nMitya. If I were to hand him over a thousand or maybe two now, would\nthe beggarly wretch agree to take himself off altogether for five years\nor, better still, thirty‐five, and without Grushenka, and give her up\nonce for all, eh?”\n\n“I—I’ll ask him,” muttered Alyosha. “If you would give him three\nthousand, perhaps he—”\n\n“That’s nonsense! You needn’t ask him now, no need! I’ve changed my\nmind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won’t give him anything, not\na penny, I want my money myself,” cried the old man, waving his hand.\n“I’ll crush him like a beetle without it. Don’t say anything to him or\nelse he will begin hoping. There’s nothing for you to do here, you\nneedn’t stay. Is that betrothed of his, Katerina Ivanovna, whom he has\nkept so carefully hidden from me all this time, going to marry him or\nnot? You went to see her yesterday, I believe?”\n\n“Nothing will induce her to abandon him.”\n\n“There you see how dearly these fine young ladies love a rake and a\nscoundrel. They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies,\nvery different from—Ah, if I had his youth and the looks I had then\n(for I was better‐looking than he at eight and twenty) I’d have been a\nconquering hero just as he is. He is a low cad! But he shan’t have\nGrushenka, anyway, he shan’t! I’ll crush him!”\n\nHis anger had returned with the last words.\n\n“You can go. There’s nothing for you to do here to‐day,” he snapped\nharshly.\n\nAlyosha went up to say good‐by to him, and kissed him on the shoulder.",
            "4": "“What’s that for?” The old man was a little surprised. “We shall see\neach other again, or do you think we shan’t?”\n\n“Not at all, I didn’t mean anything.”\n\n“Nor did I, I did not mean anything,” said the old man, looking at him.\n“Listen, listen,” he shouted after him, “make haste and come again and\nI’ll have a fish soup for you, a fine one, not like to‐day. Be sure to\ncome! Come to‐morrow, do you hear, to‐morrow!”\n\nAnd as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he went to the\ncupboard again and poured out another half‐glass.\n\n“I won’t have more!” he muttered, clearing his throat, and again he\nlocked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket. Then he went into\nhis bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was\nasleep."

            "0": "“Thank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,” thought Alyosha, as\nhe left his father’s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov’s, “or I\nmight have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.”\n\nAlyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed\ntheir energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. “Father is\nspiteful and angry, he’s made some plan and will stick to it. And what\nof Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be\nspiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I\nmust succeed in finding him to‐day, whatever happens.”\n\nBut Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road,\nwhich, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression\non him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner\ncoming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch\nfrom the High Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw\na group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the\nbridge. They were going home from school, some with their bags on their\nshoulders, others with leather satchels slung across them, some in\nshort jackets, others in little overcoats. Some even had those high\nboots with creases round the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich\nfathers love to wear. The whole group was talking eagerly about\nsomething, apparently holding a council. Alyosha had never from his\nMoscow days been able to pass children without taking notice of them,\nand although he was particularly fond of children of three or\nthereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious\nas he was to‐day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He\nlooked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the\nboys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces\naway, there was another schoolboy standing by a fence. He too had a\nsatchel at his side. He was about ten years old, pale, delicate‐looking\nand with sparkling black eyes. He kept an attentive and anxious watch\non the other six, obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just\ncome out of school, but with whom he had evidently had a feud.\n\nAlyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly‐headed, rosy boy in a\nblack jacket, observed:\n\n“When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on\nmy left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you’ve got yours on\nyour right side. So it will be awkward for you to get at it.”",
            "1": "Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical\nremark. But it is the only way for a grown‐up person to get at once\ninto confidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of\nchildren. One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on\na perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.\n\n“But he is left‐handed,” another, a fine healthy‐looking boy of eleven,\nanswered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha.\n\n“He even throws stones with his left hand,” observed a third.\n\nAt that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the\nleft‐handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy\nstanding the other side of the ditch.\n\n“Give it him, hit him back, Smurov,” they all shouted. But Smurov, the\nleft‐handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he\nthrew a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the\nother side of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging\nwith stones, flung another stone at the group; this time it flew\nstraight at Alyosha and hit him painfully on the shoulder.\n\n“He aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov,\nKaramazov!” the boys shouted, laughing. “Come, all throw at him at\nonce!” and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head\nand he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning\ntheir fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had\ntheir pockets full too.\n\n“What are you about! Aren’t you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you’ll\nkill him,” cried Alyosha.\n\nHe ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy.\nThree or four ceased throwing for a minute.\n\n“He began first!” cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish\nvoice. “He is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day\nwith a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn’t tell tales, but he must\nbe thrashed.”\n\n“But what for? I suppose you tease him.”\n\n“There, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,” cried the\nchildren. “It’s you he is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at\nhim again, don’t miss, Smurov!” and again a fire of stones, and a very\nvicious one, began. The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the\nchest; he screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards\nMihailovsky Street. They all shouted: “Aha, he is funking, he is\nrunning away. Wisp of tow!”",
            "2": "“You don’t know what a beast he is, Karamazov, killing is too good for\nhim,” said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He seemed to be\nthe eldest.\n\n“What’s wrong with him?” asked Alyosha, “is he a tell‐tale or what?”\n\nThe boys looked at one another as though derisively.\n\n“Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky?” the same boy went on. “Catch\nhim up.... You see he’s stopped again, he is waiting and looking at\nyou.”\n\n“He is looking at you,” the other boys chimed in.\n\n“You ask him, does he like a disheveled wisp of tow. Do you hear, ask\nhim that!”\n\nThere was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they\nat him.\n\n“Don’t go near him, he’ll hurt you,” cried Smurov in a warning voice.\n\n“I shan’t ask him about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him\nwith that question somehow. But I’ll find out from him why you hate him\nso.”\n\n“Find out then, find out,” cried the boys, laughing.\n\nAlyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight\ntowards the boy.\n\n“You’d better look out,” the boys called after him; “he won’t be afraid\nof you. He will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he did\nKrassotkin.”\n\nThe boy waited for him without budging. Coming up to him, Alyosha saw\nfacing him a child of about nine years old. He was an undersized weakly\nboy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him\nvindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he\nhad monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves.\nThere was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his\nright boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather,\ncarefully blackened with ink. Both the pockets of his great‐coat were\nweighed down with stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him,\nlooking inquiringly at him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha’s eyes\nthat he wouldn’t beat him, became less defiant, and addressed him\nfirst.\n\n“I am alone, and there are six of them. I’ll beat them all, alone!” he\nsaid suddenly, with flashing eyes.\n\n“I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,” observed Alyosha.\n\n“But I hit Smurov on the head!” cried the boy.\n\n“They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on\npurpose,” said Alyosha.\n\nThe boy looked darkly at him.\n\n“I don’t know you. Do you know me?” Alyosha continued.\n\n“Let me alone!” the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though\nhe were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in\nhis eyes.",
            "3": "“Very well, I am going,” said Alyosha; “only I don’t know you and I\ndon’t tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don’t want to\ntease you. Good‐by!”\n\n“Monk in silk trousers!” cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same\nvindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an\nattitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him;\nbut Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away. He had not gone\nthree steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him\na painful blow in the back.\n\n“So you’ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they\nsay that you attack on the sly,” said Alyosha, turning round again.\nThis time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha’s face; but\nAlyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the\nelbow.\n\n“Aren’t you ashamed? What have I done to you?” he cried.\n\nThe boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would\nattack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a\nlittle wild beast’s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had\ntime to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of\nhis and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten\nseconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his\nfinger away with all his might. The child let go at last and retreated\nto his former distance. Alyosha’s finger had been badly bitten to the\nbone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha took out his\nhandkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured hand. He was a full\nminute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting all the time. At last\nAlyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at him.\n\n“Very well,” he said, “you see how badly you’ve bitten me. That’s\nenough, isn’t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?”\n\nThe boy stared in amazement.\n\n“Though I don’t know you and it’s the first time I’ve seen you,”\nAlyosha went on with the same serenity, “yet I must have done something\nto you—you wouldn’t have hurt me like this for nothing. So what have I\ndone? How have I wronged you, tell me?”\n\nInstead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran\naway. Alyosha walked slowly after him towards Mihailovsky Street, and\nfor a long time he saw the child running in the distance as fast as\never, not turning his head, and no doubt still keeping up his tearful\nwail. He made up his mind to find him out as soon as he had time, and\nto solve this mystery. Just now he had not the time."

            "0": "Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov’s house, a handsome stone house of\ntwo stories, one of the finest in our town. Though Madame Hohlakov\nspent most of her time in another province where she had an estate, or\nin Moscow, where she had a house of her own, yet she had a house in our\ntown too, inherited from her forefathers. The estate in our district\nwas the largest of her three estates, yet she had been very little in\nour province before this time. She ran out to Alyosha in the hall.\n\n“Did you get my letter about the new miracle?” She spoke rapidly and\nnervously.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you show it to every one? He restored the son to his mother!”\n\n“He is dying to‐day,” said Alyosha.\n\n“I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some\none, about all this. No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I can’t see\nhim! The whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense. But now—do\nyou know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?”\n\n“Ah, that’s lucky,” cried Alyosha. “Then I shall see her here. She told\nme yesterday to be sure to come and see her to‐day.”\n\n“I know, I know all. I’ve heard exactly what happened yesterday—and the\natrocious behavior of that—creature. _C’est tragique_, and if I’d been\nin her place I don’t know what I should have done. And your brother\nDmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him?—my goodness! Alexey\nFyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there\nwith her, not that dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but\nthe other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he is sitting with her talking; they are\nhaving a serious conversation. If you could only imagine what’s passing\nbetween them now—it’s awful, I tell you it’s lacerating, it’s like some\nincredible tale of horror. They are ruining their lives for no reason\nany one can see. They both recognize it and revel in it. I’ve been\nwatching for you! I’ve been thirsting for you! It’s too much for me,\nthat’s the worst of it. I’ll tell you all about it presently, but now I\nmust speak of something else, the most important thing—I had quite\nforgotten what’s most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in\nhysterics? As soon as she heard you were here, she began to be\nhysterical!”\n\n“_Maman_, it’s you who are hysterical now, not I,” Lise’s voice caroled\nthrough a tiny crack of the door at the side. Her voice sounded as\nthough she wanted to laugh, but was doing her utmost to control it.\nAlyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping\nthrough it, but that he could not see.",
            "1": "“And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me\nhysterical too. But she is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she has been so\nill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the\nmorning and for Herzenstube to come. He says that he can make nothing\nof it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he can\nmake nothing of it. As soon as you approached the house, she screamed,\nfell into hysterics, and insisted on being wheeled back into this room\nhere.”\n\n“Mamma, I didn’t know he had come. It wasn’t on his account I wanted to\nbe wheeled into this room.”\n\n“That’s not true, Lise, Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch\nwas coming. She was on the look‐out for you.”\n\n“My darling mamma, it’s not at all clever of you. But if you want to\nmake up for it and say something very clever, dear mamma, you’d better\ntell our honored visitor, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that he has shown his\nwant of wit by venturing to us after what happened yesterday and\nalthough every one is laughing at him.”\n\n“Lise, you go too far. I declare I shall have to be severe. Who laughs\nat him? I am so glad he has come, I need him, I can’t do without him.\nOh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am exceedingly unhappy!”\n\n“But what’s the matter with you, mamma, darling?”\n\n“Ah, your caprices, Lise, your fidgetiness, your illness, that awful\nnight of fever, that awful everlasting Herzenstube, everlasting,\neverlasting, that’s the worst of it! Everything, in fact,\neverything.... Even that miracle, too! Oh, how it has upset me, how it\nhas shattered me, that miracle, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch! And that\ntragedy in the drawing‐room, it’s more than I can bear, I warn you. I\ncan’t bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy. Tell me, will Father\nZossima live till to‐morrow, will he? Oh, my God! What is happening to\nme? Every minute I close my eyes and see that it’s all nonsense, all\nnonsense.”\n\n“I should be very grateful,” Alyosha interrupted suddenly, “if you\ncould give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with. I have hurt it,\nand it’s very painful.”\n\nAlyosha unbound his bitten finger. The handkerchief was soaked with\nblood. Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes.\n\n“Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!”\n\nBut as soon as Lise saw Alyosha’s finger through the crack, she flung\nthe door wide open.",
            "2": "“Come, come here,” she cried, imperiously. “No nonsense now! Good\nheavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time?\nHe might have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water!\nYou must wash it first of all, simply hold it in cold water to stop the\npain, and keep it there, keep it there.... Make haste, mamma, some\nwater in a slop‐basin. But do make haste,” she finished nervously. She\nwas quite frightened at the sight of Alyosha’s wound.\n\n“Shouldn’t we send for Herzenstube?” cried Madame Hohlakov.\n\n“Mamma, you’ll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say\nthat he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodness’ sake\ngo yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can come\nquickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.”\n\n“Why, it’s nothing much,” cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm.\n\nYulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it.\n\n“Some lint, mamma, for mercy’s sake, bring some lint and that muddy\ncaustic lotion for wounds, what’s it called? We’ve got some. You know\nwhere the bottle is, mamma; it’s in your bedroom in the right‐hand\ncupboard, there’s a big bottle of it there with the lint.”\n\n“I’ll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don’t scream and don’t\nfuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you\nget such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?”\n\nMadame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.\n\n“First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?”\nshe asked Alyosha, quickly. “And then I’ll talk to you about something\nquite different. Well?”\n\nInstinctively feeling that the time of her mother’s absence was\nprecious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting\nwith the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her\nhands at his story.\n\n“How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?” she\ncried angrily, as though she had a right to control him. “You are\nnothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you\nmust find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it,\nfor there’s some mystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a\nquestion: does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant\nthings, but talking sensibly?”\n\n“Of course not, and I don’t feel much pain now.”",
            "3": "“That’s because your finger is in the water. It must be changed\ndirectly, for it will get warm in a minute. Yulia, bring some ice from\nthe cellar and another basin of water. Now she is gone, I can speak;\nwill you give me the letter I sent you yesterday, dear Alexey\nFyodorovitch—be quick, for mamma will be back in a minute and I don’t\nwant—”\n\n“I haven’t got the letter.”\n\n“That’s not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You’ve got it in\nthat pocket. I’ve been regretting that joke all night. Give me back the\nletter at once, give it me.”\n\n“I’ve left it at home.”\n\n“But you can’t consider me as a child, a little girl, after that silly\njoke! I beg your pardon for that silliness, but you must bring me the\nletter, if you really haven’t got it—bring it to‐day, you must, you\nmust.”\n\n“To‐day I can’t possibly, for I am going back to the monastery and I\nshan’t come and see you for the next two days—three or four perhaps—for\nFather Zossima—”\n\n“Four days, what nonsense! Listen. Did you laugh at me very much?”\n\n“I didn’t laugh at all.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because I believed all you said.”\n\n“You are insulting me!”\n\n“Not at all. As soon as I read it, I thought that all that would come\nto pass, for as soon as Father Zossima dies, I am to leave the\nmonastery. Then I shall go back and finish my studies, and when you\nreach the legal age we will be married. I shall love you. Though I\nhaven’t had time to think about it, I believe I couldn’t find a better\nwife than you, and Father Zossima tells me I must marry.”\n\n“But I am a cripple, wheeled about in a chair,” laughed Lise, flushing\ncrimson.\n\n“I’ll wheel you about myself, but I’m sure you’ll get well by then.”\n\n“But you are mad,” said Lise, nervously, “to make all this nonsense out\nof a joke! Here’s mamma, very _à propos_, perhaps. Mamma, how slow you\nalways are, how can you be so long! And here’s Yulia with the ice!”\n\n“Oh, Lise, don’t scream, above all things don’t scream. That scream\ndrives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place?\nI’ve been hunting and hunting—I do believe you did it on purpose.”\n\n“But I couldn’t tell that he would come with a bad finger, or else\nperhaps I might have done it on purpose. My darling mamma, you begin to\nsay really witty things.”\n\n“Never mind my being witty, but I must say you show nice feeling for\nAlexey Fyodorovitch’s sufferings! Oh, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,\nwhat’s killing me is no one thing in particular, not Herzenstube, but\neverything together, that’s what is too much for me.”",
            "4": "“That’s enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,” Lise laughed gayly.\n“Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That’s simply\nGoulard’s water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but it’s\na splendid lotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had\na fight with the boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger,\nisn’t he a child, a child himself? Is he fit to be married after that?\nFor only fancy, he wants to be married, mamma. Just think of him\nmarried, wouldn’t it be funny, wouldn’t it be awful?”\n\nAnd Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly at\nAlyosha.\n\n“But why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? It’s quite\nout of place—and perhaps the boy was rabid.”\n\n“Why, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!”\n\n“Why not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might\nhave been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one\nnear him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldn’t\nhave done it. Do you still feel the pain?”\n\n“It’s nothing much now.”\n\n“You don’t feel afraid of water?” asked Lise.\n\n“Come, that’s enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick\ntalking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once\nKaterina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she’s dying to see you, dying!”\n\n“Ach, mamma, go to them yourself. He can’t go just now, he is in too\nmuch pain.”\n\n“Not at all, I can go quite well,” said Alyosha.\n\n“What! You are going away? Is that what you say?”\n\n“Well, when I’ve seen them, I’ll come back here and we can talk as much\nas you like. But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once, for I\nam very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can.”\n\n“Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorovitch, don’t trouble to\ncome and see me afterwards, but go straight back to your monastery and\na good riddance. I want to sleep, I didn’t sleep all night.”\n\n“Ah, Lise, you are only making fun, but how I wish you would sleep!”\ncried Madame Hohlakov.\n\n“I don’t know what I’ve done.... I’ll stay another three minutes, five\nif you like,” muttered Alyosha.\n\n“Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he is a monster.”\n\n“Lise, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she is too\ncapricious to‐day. I am afraid to cross her. Oh, the trouble one has\nwith nervous girls! Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after\nseeing you. How quickly you have made her sleepy, and how fortunate it\nis!”",
            "5": "“Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I must kiss you for it, mamma.”\n\n“And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Madame\nHohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid\nwhisper. “I don’t want to suggest anything, I don’t want to lift the\nveil, you will see for yourself what’s going on. It’s appalling. It’s\nthe most fantastic farce. She loves your brother, Ivan, and she is\ndoing her utmost to persuade herself she loves your brother, Dmitri.\nIt’s appalling! I’ll go in with you, and if they don’t turn me out,\nI’ll stay to the end.”"

        "title": "V.\nA Laceration In The Drawing‐Room",
        "content": {
            "0": "But in the drawing‐room the conversation was already over. Katerina\nIvanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment\nAlyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take\nleave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously.\nFor this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for\nsome time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been\nseveral times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with\nKaterina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant “to carry her off”\nfrom Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous,\nthough it worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and\ndreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright\non the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that\nit was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist\nhim? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst thing\npossible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before\nimplicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and\npassionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the\nevening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a\nman like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he\nwas, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.",
            "1": "But during yesterday’s scene with Grushenka another idea had struck\nhim. The word “lacerating,” which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered,\nalmost made him start, because half waking up towards daybreak that\nnight he had cried out “Laceration, laceration,” probably applying it\nto his dream. He had been dreaming all night of the previous day’s\nscene at Katerina Ivanovna’s. Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame\nHohlakov’s blunt and persistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in\nlove with Ivan, and only deceived herself through some sort of pose,\nfrom “self‐laceration,” and tortured herself by her pretended love for\nDmitri from some fancied duty of gratitude. “Yes,” he thought, “perhaps\nthe whole truth lies in those words.” But in that case what was Ivan’s\nposition? Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina\nIvanovna’s must dominate, and she could only dominate some one like\nDmitri, and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might at last submit to\nher domination “to his own happiness” (which was what Alyosha would\nhave desired), but Ivan—no, Ivan could not submit to her, and such\nsubmission would not give him happiness. Alyosha could not help\nbelieving that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections\nflitted through his mind as he entered the drawing‐room. Another idea,\ntoo, forced itself upon him: “What if she loved neither of them—neither\nIvan nor Dmitri?”\n\nIt must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own\nthoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the\nlast month. “What do I know about love and women and how can I decide\nsuch questions?” he thought reproachfully, after such doubts and\nsurmises. And yet it was impossible not to think about it. He felt\ninstinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his\nbrothers’ lives and that a great deal depended upon it.",
            "2": "“One reptile will devour the other,” Ivan had pronounced the day\nbefore, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon\nDmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since\nhe had known Katerina Ivanovna? That phrase had, of course, escaped\nIvan unawares yesterday, but that only made it more important. If he\nfelt like that, what chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the\ncontrary, new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And\nwith which of them was Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish\nfor each of them? He loved them both, but what could he desire for each\nin the midst of these conflicting interests? He might go quite astray\nin this maze, and Alyosha’s heart could not endure uncertainty, because\nhis love was always of an active character. He was incapable of passive\nlove. If he loved any one, he set to work at once to help him. And to\ndo so he must know what he was aiming at; he must know for certain what\nwas best for each, and having ascertained this it was natural for him\nto help them both. But instead of a definite aim, he found nothing but\nuncertainty and perplexity on all sides. “It was lacerating,” as was\nsaid just now. But what could he understand even in this “laceration”?\nHe did not understand the first word in this perplexing maze.\n\nSeeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan,\nwho had already got up to go, “A minute! Stay another minute! I want to\nhear the opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Don’t go\naway,” she added, addressing Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha sit down\nbeside her, and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan.",
            "3": "“You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear\nfriends,” she began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine\ntears of suffering, and Alyosha’s heart warmed to her at once. “You,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene,\nand saw what I did. You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he did. What\nhe thought of me yesterday I don’t know. I only know one thing, that if\nit were repeated to‐day, this minute, I should express the same\nfeelings again as yesterday—the same feelings, the same words, the same\nactions. You remember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me\nin one of them” ... (as she said that, she flushed and her eyes shone).\n“I must tell you that I can’t get over it. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch.\nI don’t even know whether I still love _him_. I feel _pity_ for him,\nand that is a poor sign of love. If I loved him, if I still loved him,\nperhaps I shouldn’t be sorry for him now, but should hate him.”\n\nHer voice quivered, and tears glittered on her eyelashes. Alyosha\nshuddered inwardly. “That girl is truthful and sincere,” he thought,\n“and she does not love Dmitri any more.”\n\n“That’s true, that’s true,” cried Madame Hohlakov.\n\n“Wait, dear. I haven’t told you the chief, the final decision I came to\nduring the night. I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one—for\nme, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it—nothing. It\nwill be so all my life. My dear, kind, ever‐faithful and generous\nadviser, the one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with\nhis deep insight into the heart, approves and commends my decision. He\nknows it.”\n\n“Yes, I approve of it,” Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.\n\n“But I should like Alyosha, too (Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive my\ncalling you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, to\ntell me before my two friends whether I am right. I feel instinctively\nthat you, Alyosha, my dear brother (for you are a dear brother to me),”\nshe said again ecstatically, taking his cold hand in her hot one, “I\nforesee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in\nspite of all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and\nsubmit—I feel that.”\n\n“I don’t know what you are asking me,” said Alyosha, flushing. “I only\nknow that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more\nthan my own!... But I know nothing about such affairs,” something\nimpelled him to add hurriedly.",
            "4": "“In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing\nis honor and duty and something higher—I don’t know what—but higher\nperhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in\nmy heart, and it compels me irresistibly. But it may all be put in two\nwords. I’ve already decided, even if he marries that—creature,” she\nbegan solemnly, “whom I never, never can forgive, _even then I will not\nabandon him_. Henceforward I will never, never abandon him!” she cried,\nbreaking into a sort of pale, hysterical ecstasy. “Not that I would run\nafter him continually, get in his way and worry him. Oh, no! I will go\naway to another town—where you like—but I will watch over him all my\nlife—I will watch over him all my life unceasingly. When he becomes\nunhappy with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let\nhim come to me and he will find a friend, a sister.... Only a sister,\nof course, and so for ever; but he will learn at least that that sister\nis really his sister, who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to\nhim. I will gain my point. I will insist on his knowing me and\nconfiding entirely in me, without reserve,” she cried, in a sort of\nfrenzy. “I will be a god to whom he can pray—and that, at least, he\nowes me for his treachery and for what I suffered yesterday through\nhim. And let him see that all my life I will be true to him and the\npromise I gave him, in spite of his being untrue and betraying me. I\nwill—I will become nothing but a means for his happiness, or—how shall\nI say?—an instrument, a machine for his happiness, and that for my\nwhole life, my whole life, and that he may see that all his life!\nThat’s my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.”\n\nShe was breathless. She had perhaps intended to express her idea with\nmore dignity, art and naturalness, but her speech was too hurried and\ncrude. It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she was\nstill smarting from yesterday’s insult, and that her pride craved\nsatisfaction. She felt this herself. Her face suddenly darkened, an\nunpleasant look came into her eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a\npang of sympathy. His brother Ivan made it worse by adding:\n\n“I’ve only expressed my own view,” he said. “From any one else, this\nwould have been affected and overstrained, but from you—no. Any other\nwoman would have been wrong, but you are right. I don’t know how to\nexplain it, but I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore,\nyou are right.”",
            "5": "“But that’s only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for?\nNothing but yesterday’s insult.” Madame Hohlakov obviously had not\nintended to interfere, but she could not refrain from this very just\ncomment.\n\n“Quite so, quite so,” cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously\nannoyed at being interrupted, “in any one else this moment would be\nonly due to yesterday’s impression and would be only a moment. But with\nKaterina Ivanovna’s character, that moment will last all her life. What\nfor any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting\nburdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty. And she will be\nsustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled. Your life,\nKaterina Ivanovna, will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over\nyour own feelings, your own heroism, and your own suffering; but in the\nend that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet\ncontemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design. Yes, proud\nit certainly is, and desperate in any case, but a triumph for you. And\nthe consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete\nsatisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else.”\n\nThis was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with\nintention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke\nironically and with intention.\n\n“Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!” Madame Hohlakov cried again.\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you\nwill say!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears. Alyosha got\nup from the sofa.\n\n“It’s nothing, nothing!” she went on through her tears. “I’m upset, I\ndidn’t sleep last night. But by the side of two such friends as you and\nyour brother I still feel strong—for I know—you two will never desert\nme.”\n\n“Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow—perhaps to‐morrow—and to\nleave you for a long time—And, unluckily, it’s unavoidable,” Ivan said\nsuddenly.\n\n“To‐morrow—to Moscow!” her face was suddenly contorted; “but—but, dear\nme, how fortunate!” she cried in a voice suddenly changed. In one\ninstant there was no trace left of her tears. She underwent an\ninstantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha. Instead of a poor,\ninsulted girl, weeping in a sort of “laceration,” he saw a woman\ncompletely self‐ possessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though\nsomething agreeable had just happened.",
            "6": "“Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,” she corrected\nherself suddenly, with a charming society smile. “Such a friend as you\nare could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you.” She\nrushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his hands, pressed them\nwarmly. “But what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to\nsee auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present\nposition. You can speak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare\ndear auntie. You will know how to do that. You can’t think how wretched\nI was yesterday and this morning, wondering how I could write them that\ndreadful letter—for one can never tell such things in a letter.... Now\nit will be easy for me to write, for you will see them and explain\neverything. Oh, how glad I am! But I am only glad of that, believe me.\nOf course, no one can take your place.... I will run at once to write\nthe letter,” she finished suddenly, and took a step as though to go out\nof the room.\n\n“And what about Alyosha and his opinion, which you were so desperately\nanxious to hear?” cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry\nnote in her voice.\n\n“I had not forgotten that,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a sudden\nstandstill, “and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?” she\nadded, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. “What I said, I repeat. I\nmust have his opinion. More than that, I must have his decision! As he\nsays, so it shall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey\nFyodorovitch.... But what’s the matter?”\n\n“I couldn’t have believed it. I can’t understand it!” Alyosha cried\nsuddenly in distress.\n\n“What? What?”\n\n“He is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad. You said\nthat on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that\nbut sorry to be—losing a friend. But that was acting, too—you were\nplaying a part—as in a theater!”\n\n“In a theater? What? What do you mean?” exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna,\nprofoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.\n\n“Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him, you\npersist in telling him to his face that it’s fortunate he is going,”\nsaid Alyosha breathlessly. He was standing at the table and did not sit\ndown.\n\n“What are you talking about? I don’t understand.”",
            "7": "“I don’t understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I\nam not saying it properly, but I’ll say it all the same,” Alyosha went\non in the same shaking and broken voice. “What I see is that perhaps\nyou don’t love Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning....\nAnd Dmitri, too, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I\nreally don’t know how I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell\nthe truth ... for nobody here will tell the truth.”\n\n“What truth?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring\nin her voice.\n\n“I’ll tell you,” Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he\nwere jumping from the top of a house. “Call Dmitri; I will fetch\nhim—and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan’s and join\nyour hands. For you’re torturing Ivan, simply because you love him—and\ntorturing him, because you love Dmitri through ‘self‐laceration’—with\nan unreal love—because you’ve persuaded yourself.”\n\nAlyosha broke off and was silent.\n\n“You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot—that’s what you are!”\nKaterina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving\nwith anger.\n\nIvan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand.",
            "8": "“You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,” he said, with an expression\nAlyosha had never seen in his face before—an expression of youthful\nsincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. “Katerina Ivanovna\nhas never cared for me! She has known all the time that I cared for\nher—though I never said a word of my love to her—she knew, but she\ndidn’t care for me. I have never been her friend either, not for one\nmoment; she is too proud to need my friendship. She kept me at her side\nas a means of revenge. She revenged with me and on me all the insults\nwhich she has been continually receiving from Dmitri ever since their\nfirst meeting. For even that first meeting has rankled in her heart as\nan insult—that’s what her heart is like! She has talked to me of\nnothing but her love for him. I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina\nIvanovna, you really love him. And the more he insults you, the more\nyou love him—that’s your ‘laceration.’ You love him just as he is; you\nlove him for insulting you. If he reformed, you’d give him up at once\nand cease to love him. But you need him so as to contemplate\ncontinually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity.\nAnd it all comes from your pride. Oh, there’s a great deal of\nhumiliation and self‐abasement about it, but it all comes from\npride.... I am too young and I’ve loved you too much. I know that I\nought not to say this, that it would be more dignified on my part\nsimply to leave you, and it would be less offensive for you. But I am\ngoing far away, and shall never come back.... It is for ever. I don’t\nwant to sit beside a ‘laceration.’... But I don’t know how to speak\nnow. I’ve said everything.... Good‐by, Katerina Ivanovna; you can’t be\nangry with me, for I am a hundred times more severely punished than\nyou, if only by the fact that I shall never see you again. Good‐by! I\ndon’t want your hand. You have tortured me too deliberately for me to\nbe able to forgive you at this moment. I shall forgive you later, but\nnow I don’t want your hand. ‘Den Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,’ ” he\nadded, with a forced smile, showing, however, that he could read\nSchiller, and read him till he knew him by heart—which Alyosha would\nnever have believed. He went out of the room without saying good‐by\neven to his hostess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha clasped his hands.",
            "9": "“Ivan!” he cried desperately after him. “Come back, Ivan! No, nothing\nwill induce him to come back now!” he cried again, regretfully\nrealizing it; “but it’s my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke\nangrily, wrongly. Unjustly and angrily. He must come back here, come\nback,” Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room.\n\n“You have done no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,” Madame\nHohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. “I will do my\nutmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.”\n\nHer face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, but\nKaterina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred‐rouble notes\nin her hand.",
            "10": "“I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she began,\naddressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though\nnothing had happened. “A week—yes, I think it was a week ago—Dmitri\nFyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action—a very ugly\naction. There is a low tavern here, and in it he met that discharged\nofficer, that captain, whom your father used to employ in some\nbusiness. Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this\ncaptain, seized him by the beard and dragged him out into the street\nand for some distance along it, in that insulting fashion. And I am\ntold that his son, a boy, quite a child, who is at the school here, saw\nit and ran beside them crying and begging for his father, appealing to\nevery one to defend him, while every one laughed. You must forgive me,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think without indignation of that\ndisgraceful action of _his_ ... one of those actions of which only\nDmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger ... and in his\npassions! I can’t describe it even.... I can’t find my words. I’ve made\ninquiries about his victim, and find he is quite a poor man. His name\nis Snegiryov. He did something wrong in the army and was discharged. I\ncan’t tell you what. And now he has sunk into terrible destitution,\nwith his family—an unhappy family of sick children, and, I believe, an\ninsane wife. He has been living here a long time; he used to work as a\ncopying clerk, but now he is getting nothing. I thought if you ... that\nis I thought ... I don’t know. I am so confused. You see, I wanted to\nask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him, to find some excuse\nto go to them—I mean to that captain—oh, goodness, how badly I explain\nit!—and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to” (Alyosha\nblushed), “manage to give him this assistance, these two hundred\nroubles. He will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him to take\nit.... Or, rather, what do I mean? You see it’s not by way of\ncompensation to prevent him from taking proceedings (for I believe he\nmeant to), but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him\nfrom me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s betrothed, not from himself.... But you\nknow.... I would go myself, but you’ll know how to do it ever so much\nbetter. He lives in Lake Street, in the house of a woman called\nKalmikov.... For God’s sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it for me, and now\n... now I am rather ... tired. Good‐ by!”",
            "11": "She turned and disappeared behind the portière so quickly that Alyosha\nhad not time to utter a word, though he wanted to speak. He longed to\nbeg her pardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his heart was\nfull and he could not bear to go out of the room without it. But Madame\nHohlakov took him by the hand and drew him along with her. In the hall\nshe stopped him again as before.\n\n“She is proud, she is struggling with herself; but kind, charming,\ngenerous,” she exclaimed, in a half‐whisper. “Oh, how I love her,\nespecially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything! Dear\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, you didn’t know, but I must tell you, that we all,\nall—both her aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even—have been hoping and\npraying for nothing for the last month but that she may give up your\nfavorite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her and does not care for her,\nand may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch—such an excellent and cultivated young\nman, who loves her more than anything in the world. We are in a regular\nplot to bring it about, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that\naccount.”\n\n“But she has been crying—she has been wounded again,” cried Alyosha.\n\n“Never trust a woman’s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the\nwomen in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.”\n\n“Mamma, you are spoiling him,” Lise’s little voice cried from behind\nthe door.\n\n“No, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,” Alyosha repeated\nunconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his\nindiscretion.\n\n“Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am\nready to say so a thousand times over.”\n\n“Mamma, how has he behaved like an angel?” Lise’s voice was heard\nagain.\n\n“I somehow fancied all at once,” Alyosha went on as though he had not\nheard Lise, “that she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing....\nWhat will happen now?”\n\n“To whom, to whom?” cried Lise. “Mamma, you really want to be the death\nof me. I ask you and you don’t answer.”\n\nAt the moment the maid ran in.\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.”\n\n“What is the matter?” cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. “Mamma, I\nshall be having hysterics, and not she!”",
            "12": "“Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream, don’t persecute me. At your age\none can’t know everything that grown‐up people know. I’ll come and tell\nyou everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am\ncoming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it’s an\nexcellent thing that she is hysterical. That’s just as it ought to be.\nIn such cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine\ntears and hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that I’ll fly to her. As for\nIvan Fyodorovitch’s going away like that, it’s her own fault. But he\nwon’t go away. Lise, for mercy’s sake, don’t scream! Oh, yes; you are\nnot screaming. It’s I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am\ndelighted, delighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\nhow young, how young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out,\nwhen he said all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a\n_savant_, and all of a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and\nyouthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine,\nlike you.... And the way he repeated that German verse, it was just\nlike you! But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste\nto carry out her commission, and then make haste back. Lise, do you\nwant anything now? For mercy’s sake, don’t keep Alexey Fyodorovitch a\nminute. He will come back to you at once.”\n\nMadame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have\nopened the door to see Lise.\n\n“On no account,” cried Lise. “On no account now. Speak through the\ndoor. How have you come to be an angel? That’s the only thing I want to\nknow.”\n\n“For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good‐by!”\n\n“Don’t dare to go away like that!” Lise was beginning.\n\n“Lise, I have a real sorrow! I’ll be back directly, but I have a great,\ngreat sorrow!”\n\nAnd he ran out of the room."

            "0": "He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He\nhad rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love‐affair. “But\nwhat do I know about it? What can I tell about such things?” he\nrepeated to himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. “Oh,\nbeing ashamed would be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve.\nThe trouble is I shall certainly have caused more unhappiness.... And\nFather Zossima sent me to reconcile and bring them together. Is this\nthe way to bring them together?” Then he suddenly remembered how he had\ntried to join their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. “Though\nI acted quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,” he\nconcluded suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion.\n\nKaterina Ivanovna’s commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother\nDmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided\nto go to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a\npresentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he\nwould intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him\nanyhow. Time was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left\nAlyosha for one minute from the time he set off from the monastery.\n\nThere was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina\nIvanovna’s commission; when she had mentioned the captain’s son, the\nlittle schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at\nonce struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his\nfinger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him. Now\nAlyosha felt practically certain of this, though he could not have said\nwhy. Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he resolved to think\nno more about the “mischief” he had done, and not to torture himself\nwith remorse, but to do what he had to do, let come what would. At that\nthought he was completely comforted. Turning to the street where Dmitri\nlodged, he felt hungry, and taking out of his pocket the roll he had\nbrought from his father’s, he ate it. It made him feel stronger.",
            "1": "Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet‐maker,\nhis son, and his old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha.\n“He hasn’t slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he has gone\naway,” the old man said in answer to Alyosha’s persistent inquiries.\nAlyosha saw that he was answering in accordance with instructions. When\nhe asked whether he were not at Grushenka’s or in hiding at Foma’s\n(Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose), all three looked at him in alarm.\n“They are fond of him, they are doing their best for him,” thought\nAlyosha. “That’s good.”\n\nAt last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little\nhouse, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street,\nand with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He\ncrossed the yard and found the door opening into the passage. On the\nleft of the passage lived the old woman of the house with her old\ndaughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for\nthe captain, one of them at last understood that he was asking for\ntheir lodgers, and pointed to a door across the passage. The captain’s\nlodging turned out to be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on\nthe iron latch to open the door, when he was struck by the strange hush\nwithin. Yet he knew from Katerina Ivanovna’s words that the man had a\nfamily. “Either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me\ncoming and are waiting for me to open the door. I’d better knock\nfirst,” and he knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an\ninterval of perhaps ten seconds.\n\n“Who’s there?” shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice.",
            "2": "Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found\nhimself in a regular peasant’s room. Though it was large, it was\ncumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were\nseveral people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove. From the\nstove to the window on the left was a string running across the room,\nand on it there were rags hanging. There was a bedstead against the\nwall on each side, right and left, covered with knitted quilts. On the\none on the left was a pyramid of four print‐covered pillows, each\nsmaller than the one beneath. On the other there was only one very\nsmall pillow. The opposite corner was screened off by a curtain or a\nsheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain could be seen a bed made up\non a bench and a chair. The rough square table of plain wood had been\nmoved into the middle window. The three windows, which consisted each\nof four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close\nshut, so that the room was not very light and rather stuffy. On the\ntable was a frying‐pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a\nhalf‐eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of\nvodka.",
            "3": "A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a\nchair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and yellow, and her\nsunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill. But what\nstruck Alyosha most was the expression in the poor woman’s eyes—a look\nof surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride. And while he was talking\nto her husband, her big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other\nwith the same haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the\nwindow stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair,\npoorly but very neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as\nhe came in. Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. She\nwas a very sad sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and\ncrippled “with withered legs,” as Alyosha was told afterwards. Her\ncrutches stood in the corner close by. The strikingly beautiful and\ngentle eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A\nman of forty‐five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs.\nHe was spare, small and weakly built. He had reddish hair and a scanty\nlight‐colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow (this comparison and\nthe phrase “a wisp of tow” flashed at once into Alyosha’s mind for some\nreason, he remembered it afterwards). It was obviously this gentleman\nwho had shouted to him, as there was no other man in the room. But when\nAlyosha went in, he leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting,\nand, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to\nAlyosha.\n\n“It’s a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to!”\nthe girl standing in the left corner said aloud. The man spun round\ninstantly towards her and answered her in an excited and breaking\nvoice:\n\n“No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,” he turned again to\nAlyosha, “what has brought you to—our retreat?”",
            "4": "Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had seen\nhim. There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him.\nThough he had obviously just been drinking, he was not drunk. There was\nextraordinary impudence in his expression, and yet, strange to say, at\nthe same time there was fear. He looked like a man who had long been\nkept in subjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned\nand was trying to assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who\nwants dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In\nhis words and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of\ncrazy humor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually\nshifting from one tone to another. The question about “our retreat” he\nhad asked as it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and skipping\nup so close to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a step. He was\ndressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted. He wore\nchecked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion, and\nof very thin material. They were so crumpled and so short that he\nlooked as though he had grown out of them like a boy.\n\n“I am Alexey Karamazov,” Alyosha began in reply.\n\n“I quite understand that, sir,” the gentleman snapped out at once to\nassure him that he knew who he was already. “I am Captain Snegiryov,\nsir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you—”\n\n“Oh, I’ve come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you—if\nonly you allow me.”\n\n“In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated. That’s what they\nused to say in the old comedies, ‘kindly be seated,’ ” and with a rapid\ngesture he seized an empty chair (it was a rough wooden chair, not\nupholstered) and set it for him almost in the middle of the room; then,\ntaking another similar chair for himself, he sat down facing Alyosha,\nso close to him that their knees almost touched.\n\n“Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian\ninfantry, put to shame for his vices, but still a captain. Though I\nmight not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life\nI’ve learnt to say ‘sir.’ It’s a word you use when you’ve come down in\nthe world.”\n\n“That’s very true,” smiled Alyosha. “But is it used involuntarily or on\npurpose?”",
            "5": "“As God’s above, it’s involuntary, and I usen’t to use it! I didn’t use\nthe word ‘sir’ all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I\nbegan to say ‘sir.’ It’s the work of a higher power. I see you are\ninterested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited your\ncuriosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise\nof hospitality?”\n\n“I’ve come—about that business.”\n\n“About what business?” the captain interrupted impatiently.\n\n“About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Alyosha\nblurted out awkwardly.\n\n“What meeting, sir? You don’t mean that meeting? About my ‘wisp of\ntow,’ then?” He moved closer so that his knees positively knocked\nagainst Alyosha. His lips were strangely compressed like a thread.\n\n“What wisp of tow?” muttered Alyosha.\n\n“He is come to complain of me, father!” cried a voice familiar to\nAlyosha—the voice of the schoolboy—from behind the curtain. “I bit his\nfinger just now.” The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his assailant\nlying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner\nunder the ikons. The boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded\nquilt. He was evidently unwell, and, judging by his glittering eyes, he\nwas in a fever. He looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he felt he\nwas at home and could not be touched.\n\n“What! Did he bite your finger?” The captain jumped up from his chair.\n“Was it your finger he bit?”\n\n“Yes. He was throwing stones with other schoolboys. There were six of\nthem against him alone. I went up to him, and he threw a stone at me\nand then another at my head. I asked him what I had done to him. And\nthen he rushed at me and bit my finger badly, I don’t know why.”\n\n“I’ll thrash him, sir, at once—this minute!” The captain jumped up from\nhis seat.\n\n“But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ... I don’t\nwant him to be thrashed. Besides, he seems to be ill.”",
            "6": "“And do you suppose I’d thrash him? That I’d take my Ilusha and thrash\nhim before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once,\nsir?” said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he were\ngoing to attack him. “I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of\nthrashing Ilusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with\nthis knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath? I should\nthink four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for\nvengeance. You won’t ask for the fifth one too?” He stopped short with\na catch in his throat. Every feature in his face was twitching and\nworking; he looked extremely defiant. He was in a sort of frenzy.\n\n“I think I understand it all now,” said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully,\nstill keeping his seat. “So your boy is a good boy, he loves his\nfather, and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant.... Now I\nunderstand it,” he repeated thoughtfully. “But my brother Dmitri\nFyodorovitch regrets his action, I know that, and if only it is\npossible for him to come to you, or better still, to meet you in that\nsame place, he will ask your forgiveness before every one—if you wish\nit.”\n\n“After pulling out my beard, you mean, he will ask my forgiveness? And\nhe thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn’t he?”\n\n“Oh, no! On the contrary, he will do anything you like and in any way\nyou like.”\n\n“So if I were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in\nthat very tavern—‘The Metropolis’ it’s called—or in the market‐place,\nhe would do it?”\n\n“Yes, he would even go down on his knees.”\n\n“You’ve pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced\nme to the heart! I am only too sensible of your brother’s generosity.\nAllow me to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son—my litter.\nIf I die, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will\ncare for a wretch like me? That’s a great thing the Lord has ordained\nfor every man of my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love\neven a man like me.”\n\n“Ah, that’s perfectly true!” exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n“Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us\nto shame!” cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her father\nwith a disdainful and contemptuous air.\n\n“Wait a little, Varvara!” cried her father, speaking peremptorily but\nlooking at her quite approvingly. “That’s her character,” he said,\naddressing Alyosha again.\n\n“And in all nature there was naught\nThat could find favor in his eyes—",
            "7": "\nor rather in the feminine: that could find favor in her eyes. But now\nlet me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She is crippled, she is\nforty‐ three; she can move, but very little. She is of humble origin.\nArina Petrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch\nKaramazov. Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch.” He took him by the hand and\nwith unexpected force pulled him up. “You must stand up to be\nintroduced to a lady. It’s not the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h’m ...\netcetera, but his brother, radiant with modest virtues. Come, Arina\nPetrovna, come, mamma, first your hand to be kissed.”\n\nAnd he kissed his wife’s hand respectfully and even tenderly. The girl\nat the window turned her back indignantly on the scene; an expression\nof extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of\nthe woman.\n\n“Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,” she said.\n\n“Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,” he whispered\nagain.\n\n“Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of\nTchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he pulled you up? He calls me\ncrippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am\nshriveled up myself. Once I used to be so fat, but now it’s as though I\nhad swallowed a needle.”\n\n“We are of humble origin,” the captain muttered again.\n\n“Oh, father, father!” the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent\non her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief.\n\n“Buffoon!” blurted out the girl at the window.",
            "8": "“Have you heard our news?” said the mother, pointing at her daughters.\n“It’s like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again.\nWhen we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don’t\nmean to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon’s\nwife used to come then and say, ‘Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of\nthe noblest heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,’ she would say, ‘is of the\nbrood of hell.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘that’s a matter of taste; but you are\na little spitfire.’ ‘And you want keeping in your place,’ says she.\n‘You black sword,’ said I, ‘who asked you to teach me?’ ‘But my\nbreath,’ says she, ‘is clean, and yours is unclean.’ ‘You ask all the\nofficers whether my breath is unclean.’ And ever since then I had it in\nmy mind. Not long ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that\nvery general come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him: ‘Your\nExcellency,’ said I, ‘can a lady’s breath be unpleasant?’ ‘Yes,’ he\nanswered; ‘you ought to open a window‐ pane or open the door, for the\nair is not fresh here.’ And they all go on like that! And what is my\nbreath to them? The dead smell worse still! ‘I won’t spoil the air,’\nsaid I, ‘I’ll order some slippers and go away.’ My darlings, don’t\nblame your own mother! Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can’t please you?\nThere’s only Ilusha who comes home from school and loves me. Yesterday\nhe brought me an apple. Forgive your own mother—forgive a poor lonely\ncreature! Why has my breath become unpleasant to you?”\n\nAnd the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her\ncheeks. The captain rushed up to her.\n\n“Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves\nyou, every one adores you.” He began kissing both her hands again and\ntenderly stroking her face; taking the dinner‐napkin, he began wiping\naway her tears. Alyosha fancied that he too had tears in his eyes.\n“There, you see, you hear?” he turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha,\npointing to the poor imbecile.\n\n“I see and hear,” muttered Alyosha.\n\n“Father, father, how can you—with him! Let him alone!” cried the boy,\nsitting up in his bed and gazing at his father with glowing eyes.\n\n“Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead\nto anything!” shouted Varvara, stamping her foot with passion.",
            "9": "“Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I’ll make haste to\nsatisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I’ll put\non mine. We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but\nnot within these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I\nforgot to introduce her to you. She is a heavenly angel incarnate ...\nwho has flown down to us mortals,... if you can understand.”\n\n“There he is shaking all over, as though he is in convulsions!” Varvara\nwent on indignantly.\n\n“And she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now,\nshe is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she has good reason to call\nme so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.”\n\nAnd, snatching Alyosha’s hand, he drew him out of the room into the\nstreet."

            "0": "“The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the\nword. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your kind interest.”\n\n“I too have something important to say to you,” observed Alyosha, “only\nI don’t know how to begin.”\n\n“To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked\nin upon me without some object. Unless you come simply to complain of\nthe boy, and that’s hardly likely. And, by the way, about the boy: I\ncould not explain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene\nto you. My tow was thicker a week ago—I mean my beard. That’s the\nnickname they give to my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your\nbrother Dmitri Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard, I’d done\nnothing, he was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me. He\ndragged me out of the tavern into the market‐place; at that moment the\nboys were coming out of school, and with them Ilusha. As soon as he saw\nme in such a state he rushed up to me. ‘Father,’ he cried, ‘father!’ He\ncaught hold of me, hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my\nassailant, ‘Let go, let go, it’s my father, forgive him!’—yes, he\nactually cried ‘forgive him.’ He clutched at that hand, that very hand,\nin his little hands and kissed it.... I remember his little face at\nthat moment, I haven’t forgotten it and I never shall!”\n\n“I swear,” cried Alyosha, “that my brother will express his most deep\nand sincere regret, even if he has to go down on his knees in that same\nmarket‐place.... I’ll make him or he is no brother of mine!”",
            "1": "“Aha, then it’s only a suggestion! And it does not come from him but\nsimply from the generosity of your own warm heart. You should have said\nso. No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother’s highly\nchivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at\nthe time. He left off dragging me by my beard and released me: ‘You are\nan officer,’ he said, ‘and I am an officer, if you can find a decent\nman to be your second send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction,\nthough you are a scoundrel.’ That’s what he said. A chivalrous spirit\nindeed! I retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record\nimprinted for ever on Ilusha’s soul. No, it’s not for us to claim the\nprivileges of noblemen. Judge for yourself. You’ve just been in our\nmansion, what did you see there? Three ladies, one a cripple and\nweak‐minded, another a cripple and hunchback and the third not crippled\nbut far too clever. She is a student, dying to get back to Petersburg,\nto work for the emancipation of the Russian woman on the banks of the\nNeva. I won’t speak of Ilusha, he is only nine. I am alone in the\nworld, and if I die, what will become of all of them? I simply ask you\nthat. And if I challenge him and he kills me on the spot, what then?\nWhat will become of them? And worse still, if he doesn’t kill me but\nonly cripples me: I couldn’t work, but I should still be a mouth to\nfeed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I take Ilusha\nfrom school and send him to beg in the streets? That’s what it means\nfor me to challenge him to a duel. It’s silly talk and nothing else.”\n\n“He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet in the\nmiddle of the market‐place,” cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.",
            "2": "“I did think of prosecuting him,” the captain went on, “but look in our\ncode, could I get much compensation for a personal injury? And then\nAgrafena Alexandrovna[3] sent for me and shouted at me: ‘Don’t dare to\ndream of it! If you proceed against him, I’ll publish it to all the\nworld that he beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be\nprosecuted.’ I call God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by\nwhose commands I acted, wasn’t it by her own and Fyodor Pavlovitch’s?\n‘And what’s more,’ she went on, ‘I’ll dismiss you for good and you’ll\nnever earn another penny from me. I’ll speak to my merchant too’\n(that’s what she calls her old man) ‘and he will dismiss you!’ And if\nhe dismisses me, what can I earn then from any one? Those two are all I\nhave to look to, for your Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over\nemploying me, for another reason, but he means to make use of papers\nI’ve signed to go to law against me. And so I kept quiet, and you have\nseen our retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger\nmuch? I didn’t like to go into it in our mansion before him.”\n\n“Yes, very much, and he was in a great fury. He was avenging you on me\nas a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he was\nthrowing stones at his school‐fellows! It’s very dangerous. They might\nkill him. They are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break\nsomebody’s head.”\n\n“That’s just what has happened. He has been bruised by a stone to‐day.\nNot on the head but on the chest, just above the heart. He came home\ncrying and groaning and now he is ill.”\n\n“And you know he attacks them first. He is bitter against them on your\naccount. They say he stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen‐knife\nnot long ago.”\n\n“I’ve heard about that too, it’s dangerous. Krassotkin is an official\nhere, we may hear more about it.”\n\n“I would advise you,” Alyosha went on warmly, “not to send him to\nschool at all for a time till he is calmer ... and his anger is\npassed.”",
            "3": "“Anger!” the captain repeated, “that’s just what it is. He is a little\ncreature, but it’s a mighty anger. You don’t know all, sir. Let me tell\nyou more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about\nthe ‘wisp of tow.’ Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they\nare angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often\nmerciless. Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha. An\nordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of\nhis father, sir, but he stood up for his father against them all. For\nhis father and for truth and justice. For what he suffered when he\nkissed your brother’s hand and cried to him ‘Forgive father, forgive\nhim,’—that only God knows—and I, his father. For our children—not your\nchildren, but ours—the children of the poor gentlemen looked down upon\nby every one—know what justice means, sir, even at nine years old. How\nshould the rich know? They don’t explore such depths once in their\nlives. But at that moment in the square when he kissed his hand, at\nthat moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means. That truth\nentered into him and crushed him for ever, sir,” the captain said hotly\nagain with a sort of frenzy, and he struck his right fist against his\nleft palm as though he wanted to show how “the truth” crushed Ilusha.\n“That very day, sir, he fell ill with fever and was delirious all\nnight. All that day he hardly said a word to me, but I noticed he kept\nwatching me from the corner, though he turned to the window and\npretended to be learning his lessons. But I could see his mind was not\non his lessons. Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful man\nas I am, and I don’t remember much. Mamma began crying, too—I am very\nfond of mamma—well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles. Don’t\ndespise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The\nbest men amongst us are the greatest drunkards. I lay down and I don’t\nremember about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at\nhim at school. ‘Wisp of tow,’ they shouted, ‘your father was pulled out\nof the tavern by his wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.’ ”",
            "4": "“On the third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale\nand wretched. ‘What is it?’ I asked. He wouldn’t answer. Well, there’s\nno talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in\nit. What’s more, the girls had heard about it the very first day.\nVarvara had begun snarling. ‘You fools and buffoons, can you ever do\nanything rational?’ ‘Quite so,’ I said, ‘can we ever do anything\nrational?’ For the time I turned it off like that. So in the evening I\ntook the boy out for a walk, for you must know we go for a walk every\nevening, always the same way, along which we are going now—from our\ngate to that great stone which lies alone in the road under the hurdle,\nwhich marks the beginning of the town pasture. A beautiful and lonely\nspot, sir. Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual. He has a\nlittle hand, his fingers are thin and cold—he suffers with his chest,\nyou know. ‘Father,’ said he, ‘father!’ ‘Well?’ said I. I saw his eyes\nflashing. ‘Father, how he treated you then!’ ‘It can’t be helped,\nIlusha,’ I said. ‘Don’t forgive him, father, don’t forgive him! At\nschool they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it.’ ‘No, Ilusha,’\nsaid I, ‘I would not take money from him for anything.’ Then he began\ntrembling all over, took my hand in both his and kissed it again.\n‘Father,’ he said, ‘father, challenge him to a duel, at school they say\nyou are a coward and won’t challenge him, and that you’ll accept ten\nroubles from him.’ ‘I can’t challenge him to a duel, Ilusha,’ I\nanswered. And I told briefly what I’ve just told you. He listened.\n‘Father,’ he said, ‘anyway don’t forgive it. When I grow up I’ll call\nhim out myself and kill him.’ His eyes shone and glowed. And of course\nI am his father, and I had to put in a word: ‘It’s a sin to kill,’ I\nsaid, ‘even in a duel.’ ‘Father,’ he said, ‘when I grow up, I’ll knock\nhim down, knock the sword out of his hand, I’ll fall on him, wave my\nsword over him and say: “I could kill you, but I forgive you, so\nthere!” ’ You see what the workings of his little mind have been during\nthese two days; he must have been planning that vengeance all day, and\nraving about it at night.",
            "5": "“But he began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about\nit the day before yesterday, and you are right, I won’t send him to\nthat school any more. I heard that he was standing up against all the\nclass alone and defying them all, that his heart was full of\nresentment, of bitterness—I was alarmed about him. We went for another\nwalk. ‘Father,’ he asked, ‘are the rich people stronger than any one\nelse on earth?’ ‘Yes, Ilusha,’ I said, ‘there are no people on earth\nstronger than the rich.’ ‘Father,’ he said, ‘I will get rich, I will\nbecome an officer and conquer everybody. The Tsar will reward me, I\nwill come back here and then no one will dare—’ Then he was silent and\nhis lips still kept trembling. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘what a horrid town\nthis is.’ ‘Yes, Ilusha,’ I said, ‘it isn’t a very nice town.’ ‘Father,\nlet us move into another town, a nice one,’ he said, ‘where people\ndon’t know about us.’ ‘We will move, we will, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘only I\nmust save up for it.’ I was glad to be able to turn his mind from\npainful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we would move to another\ntown, how we would buy a horse and cart. ‘We will put mamma and your\nsisters inside, we will cover them up and we’ll walk, you shall have a\nlift now and then, and I’ll walk beside, for we must take care of our\nhorse, we can’t all ride. That’s how we’ll go.’ He was enchanted at\nthat, most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving him. For\nof course a Russian boy is born among horses. We chattered a long\nwhile. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his mind and comforted\nhim.",
            "6": "“That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night\neverything was changed. He had gone to school in the morning, he came\nback depressed, terribly depressed. In the evening I took him by the\nhand and we went for a walk; he would not talk. There was a wind\nblowing and no sun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on. We\nwalked along, both of us depressed. ‘Well, my boy,’ said I, ‘how about\nour setting off on our travels?’ I thought I might bring him back to\nour talk of the day before. He didn’t answer, but I felt his fingers\ntrembling in my hand. Ah, I thought, it’s a bad job; there’s something\nfresh. We had reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on the\nstone. And in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling.\nThere were as many as thirty in sight. Of course, it’s just the season\nfor the kites. ‘Look, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘it’s time we got out our last\nyear’s kite again. I’ll mend it, where have you put it away?’ My boy\nmade no answer. He looked away and turned sideways to me. And then a\ngust of wind blew up the sand. He suddenly fell on me, threw both his\nlittle arms round my neck and held me tight. You know, when children\nare silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears when they are in\ngreat trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall in streams.\nWith those warm streams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face. He sobbed\nand shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up against me\nas I sat on the stone. ‘Father,’ he kept crying, ‘dear father, how he\ninsulted you!’ And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other’s arms.\n‘Ilusha,’ I said to him, ‘Ilusha darling.’ No one saw us then. God\nalone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank\nyour brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won’t thrash my boy for\nyour satisfaction.”\n\nHe had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha\nfelt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one\nelse in his, Alyosha’s place, the man would not have spoken so openly\nand would not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha,\nwhose heart was trembling on the verge of tears.\n\n“Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!” he cried. “If you\ncould arrange it—”\n\n“Certainly, sir,” muttered the captain.",
            "7": "“But now listen to something quite different!” Alyosha went on. “I have\na message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his\nbetrothed, too, a noble‐hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I\nhave a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for\nhearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your\nunfortunate position, she commissioned me at once—just now—to bring you\nthis help from her—but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has\nabandoned her. Nor from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but\nfrom her, only from her! She entreats you to accept her help.... You\nhave both been insulted by the same man. She thought of you only when\nshe had just received a similar insult from him—similar in its cruelty,\nI mean. She comes like a sister to help a brother in misfortune.... She\ntold me to persuade you to take these two hundred roubles from her, as\nfrom a sister, knowing that you are in such need. No one will know of\nit, it can give rise to no unjust slander. There are the two hundred\nroubles, and I swear you must take them unless—unless all men are to be\nenemies on earth! But there are brothers even on earth.... You have a\ngenerous heart ... you must see that, you must,” and Alyosha held out\ntwo new rainbow‐colored hundred‐rouble notes.\n\nThey were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the\nfence, and there was no one near. The notes seemed to produce a\ntremendous impression on the captain. He started, but at first only\nfrom astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last\nthing he expected. Nothing could have been farther from his dreams than\nhelp from any one—and such a sum!\n\nHe took the notes, and for a minute he was almost unable to answer,\nquite a new expression came into his face.\n\n“That for me? So much money—two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I\nhaven’t seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And\nshe says she is a sister.... And is that the truth?”\n\n“I swear that all I told you is the truth,” cried Alyosha.\n\nThe captain flushed red.\n\n“Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan’t be behaving like a\nscoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan’t be a scoundrel?\nNo, Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,” he hurried, touching Alyosha\nwith both his hands. “You are persuading me to take it, saying that\nit’s a sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won’t you feel\ncontempt for me if I take it, eh?”",
            "8": "“No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan’t! And no one will ever know\nbut me—I, you and she, and one other lady, her great friend.”\n\n“Never mind the lady! Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like\nthis you must listen, for you can’t understand what these two hundred\nroubles mean to me now.” The poor fellow went on rising gradually into\na sort of incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. He was thrown off his\nbalance and talked extremely fast, as though afraid he would not be\nallowed to say all he had to say.",
            "9": "“Besides its being honestly acquired from a ‘sister,’ so highly\nrespected and revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and\nNina, my hunchback angel daughter? Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the\nkindness of his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. ‘I\ncan make nothing of it,’ said he, but he prescribed a mineral water\nwhich is kept at a chemist’s here. He said it would be sure to do her\ngood, and he ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them. The\nmineral water costs thirty copecks, and she’d need to drink forty\nbottles perhaps; so I took the prescription and laid it on the shelf\nunder the ikons, and there it lies. And he ordered hot baths for Nina\nwith something dissolved in them, morning and evening. But how can we\ncarry out such a cure in our mansion, without servants, without help,\nwithout a bath, and without water? Nina is rheumatic all over, I don’t\nthink I told you that. All her right side aches at night, she is in\nagony, and, would you believe it, the angel bears it without groaning\nfor fear of waking us. We eat what we can get, and she’ll only take the\nleavings, what you’d scarcely give to a dog. ‘I am not worth it, I am\ntaking it from you, I am a burden on you,’ that’s what her angel eyes\ntry to express. We wait on her, but she doesn’t like it. ‘I am a\nuseless cripple, no good to any one.’ As though she were not worth it,\nwhen she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness. Without\nher, without her gentle word it would be hell among us! She softens\neven Varvara. And don’t judge Varvara harshly either, she is an angel\ntoo, she, too, has suffered wrong. She came to us for the summer, and\nshe brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up, to\ngo back with to Petersburg in September, that is now. But we took her\nmoney and lived on it, so now she has nothing to go back with. Though\nindeed she couldn’t go back, for she has to work for us like a slave.\nShe is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back. She waits\non us all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed. And\nmamma is capricious and tearful and insane! And now I can get a servant\nwith this money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get\nmedicines for the dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg,\nI can buy beef, I can feed them properly. Good Lord, but it’s a dream!”\n\nAlyosha was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that\nthe poor fellow had consented to be made happy.",
            "10": "“Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,” the captain began to talk with\nfrenzied rapidity, carried away by a new day‐dream. “Do you know that\nIlusha and I will perhaps really carry out our dream. We will buy a\nhorse and cart, a black horse, he insists on its being black, and we\nwill set off as we pretended the other day. I have an old friend, a\nlawyer in K. province, and I heard through a trustworthy man that if I\nwere to go he’d give me a place as clerk in his office, so, who knows,\nmaybe he would. So I’d just put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha\ncould drive, and I’d walk, I’d walk.... Why, if I only succeed in\ngetting one debt paid that’s owing me, I should have perhaps enough for\nthat too!”\n\n“There would be enough!” cried Alyosha. “Katerina Ivanovna will send\nyou as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what\nyou want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it\nback later.... (You’ll get rich, you’ll get rich!) And you know you\ncouldn’t have a better idea than to move to another province! It would\nbe the saving of you, especially of your boy—and you ought to go\nquickly, before the winter, before the cold. You must write to us when\nyou are there, and we will always be brothers.... No, it’s not a\ndream!”\n\nAlyosha could have hugged him, he was so pleased. But glancing at him\nhe stopped short. The man was standing with his neck outstretched and\nhis lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face. His lips were\nmoving as though trying to articulate something; no sound came, but\nstill his lips moved. It was uncanny.\n\n“What is it?” asked Alyosha, startled.\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I ... you,” muttered the captain, faltering,\nlooking at him with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of\ndesperate resolution. At the same time there was a sort of grin on his\nlips. “I ... you, sir ... wouldn’t you like me to show you a little\ntrick I know?” he murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his\nvoice no longer faltering.\n\n“What trick?”\n\n“A pretty trick,” whispered the captain. His mouth was twisted on the\nleft side, his left eye was screwed up. He still stared at Alyosha.\n\n“What is the matter? What trick?” Alyosha cried, now thoroughly\nalarmed.",
            "11": "“Why, look,” squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two\nnotes which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and\nforefinger during the conversation, he crumpled them up savagely and\nsqueezed them tight in his right hand. “Do you see, do you see?” he\nshrieked, pale and infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his hand, he\nthrew the crumpled notes on the sand. “Do you see?” he shrieked again,\npointing to them. “Look there!”\n\nAnd with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel, gasping and\nexclaiming as he did so:\n\n“So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your\nmoney! So much for your money!”\n\nSuddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his\nwhole figure expressed unutterable pride.\n\n“Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor,”\nhe cried, raising his arm in the air. Then he turned quickly and began\nto run; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round\nand kissed his hand to Alyosha. He ran another five paces and then\nturned round for the last time. This time his face was not contorted\nwith laughter, but quivering all over with tears. In a tearful,\nfaltering, sobbing voice he cried:\n\n“What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?”\n\nAnd then he ran on without turning. Alyosha looked after him,\ninexpressibly grieved. Oh, he saw that till the very last moment the\nman had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes. He did\nnot turn back. Alyosha knew he would not. He would not follow him and\ncall him back, he knew why. When he was out of sight, Alyosha picked up\nthe two notes. They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been\npressed into the sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new\nones when Alyosha unfolded them and smoothed them out. After smoothing\nthem out, he folded them up, put them in his pocket and went to\nKaterina Ivanovna to report on the success of her commission.\n\n\n\n\nBook V. Pro And Contra"

            "0": "Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha. She was flustered;\nsomething important had happened. Katerina Ivanovna’s hysterics had\nended in a fainting fit, and then “a terrible, awful weakness had\nfollowed, she lay with her eyes turned up and was delirious. Now she\nwas in a fever. They had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the\naunts. The aunts were already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come.\nThey were all sitting in her room, waiting. She was unconscious now,\nand what if it turned to brain fever!”\n\nMadame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. “This is serious, serious,” she\nadded at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her before\nhad been serious. Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to\ndescribe his adventures, but she interrupted him at the first words.\nShe had not time to listen. She begged him to sit with Lise and wait\nfor her there.",
            "1": "“Lise,” she whispered almost in his ear, “Lise has greatly surprised me\njust now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my\nheart forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she\nbegan to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to‐day and\nyesterday, though she was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she\nwas seriously sorry for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite\nsurprised. She has never been really sorry for laughing at me, but has\nonly made a joke of it. And you know she is laughing at me every\nminute. But this time she was in earnest. She thinks a great deal of\nyour opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and don’t take offense or be wounded\nby her if you can help it. I am never hard upon her, for she’s such a\nclever little thing. Would you believe it? She said just now that you\nwere a friend of her childhood, ‘the greatest friend of her\nchildhood’—just think of that—‘greatest friend’—and what about me? She\nhas very strong feelings and memories, and, what’s more, she uses these\nphrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden when you\nleast expect them. She spoke lately about a pine‐tree, for instance:\nthere used to be a pine‐tree standing in our garden in her early\nchildhood. Very likely it’s standing there still; so there’s no need to\nspeak in the past tense. Pine‐trees are not like people, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, they don’t change quickly. ‘Mamma,’ she said, ‘I remember\nthis pine‐tree as in a dream,’ only she said something so original\nabout it that I can’t repeat it. Besides, I’ve forgotten it. Well,\ngood‐by! I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey\nFyodorovitch, I’ve been out of my mind twice in my life. Go to Lise,\ncheer her up, as you always can so charmingly. Lise,” she cried, going\nto her door, “here I’ve brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you\ninsulted so. He is not at all angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he\nis surprised that you could suppose so.”\n\n“_Merci, maman._ Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch.”\n\nAlyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed\ncrimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always\ndo in such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as\nthough they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.",
            "2": "“Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she\ntold me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you\nknow, although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one\nthing to another ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him the\nmoney and how is that poor man getting on?”\n\n“The fact is I didn’t give it to him, and it’s a long story,” answered\nAlyosha, as though he, too, could think of nothing but his regret at\nhaving failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he, too, looked away,\nand that he, too, was trying to talk of other things.\n\nAlyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the\nfirst words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise’s\nattention as well. He spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of\nthe strong impression he had just received, and he succeeded in telling\nhis story well and circumstantially. In old days in Moscow he had been\nfond of coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to\nhim, what he had read, or what he remembered of his childhood.\nSometimes they had made day‐dreams and woven whole romances\ntogether—generally cheerful and amusing ones. Now they both felt\nsuddenly transported to the old days in Moscow, two years before. Lise\nwas extremely touched by his story. Alyosha described Ilusha with warm\nfeeling. When he finished describing how the luckless man trampled on\nthe money, Lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out:\n\n“So you didn’t give him the money! So you let him run away! Oh, dear,\nyou ought to have run after him!”\n\n“No, Lise; it’s better I didn’t run after him,” said Alyosha, getting\nup from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.\n\n“How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is\nhopeless?”\n\n“Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them.\nHe’ll take the money to‐morrow. To‐morrow he will be sure to take it,”\nsaid Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. “You see, Lise,” he went\non, stopping suddenly before her, “I made one blunder, but that, even\nthat, is all for the best.”\n\n“What blunder, and why is it for the best?”",
            "3": "“I’ll tell you. He is a man of weak and timorous character; he has\nsuffered so much and is very good‐natured. I keep wondering why he took\noffense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he did\nnot know that he was going to trample on the notes. And I think now\nthat there was a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have\nbeen otherwise in his position.... To begin with, he was sore at having\nbeen so glad of the money in my presence and not having concealed it\nfrom me. If he had been pleased, but not so much; if he had not shown\nit; if he had begun affecting scruples and difficulties, as other\npeople do when they take money, he might still endure to take it. But\nhe was too genuinely delighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he\nis a good and truthful man—that’s the worst of the whole business. All\nthe while he talked, his voice was so weak, so broken, he talked so\nfast, so fast, he kept laughing such a laugh, or perhaps he was\ncrying—yes, I am sure he was crying, he was so delighted—and he talked\nabout his daughters—and about the situation he could get in another\ntown.... And when he had poured out his heart, he felt ashamed at\nhaving shown me his inmost soul like that. So he began to hate me at\nonce. He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. What had made\nhim feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted me\nas a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried to\nintimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing\nme; he kept touching me with his hands. This must have been how he came\nto feel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very\nimportant one. I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough\nto move to another town, we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself\nwould give him as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck\nhim all at once. Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help him?\nYou know, Lise, it’s awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when\nother people look at him as though they were his benefactors.... I’ve\nheard that; Father Zossima told me so. I don’t know how to put it, but\nI have often seen it myself. And I feel like that myself, too. And the\nworst of it was that though he did not know, up to the very last\nminute, that he would trample on the notes, he had a kind of\npresentiment of it, I am sure of that. That’s just what made him so\necstatic, that he had that presentiment.... And though it’s so\ndreadful, it’s all for the best. In fact, I believe nothing better\ncould have happened.”",
            "4": "“Why, why could nothing better have happened?” cried Lise, looking with\ngreat surprise at Alyosha.\n\n“Because if he had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he\nwould be crying with mortification, that’s just what would have\nhappened. And most likely he would have come to me early to‐morrow, and\nperhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did\njust now. But now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though\nhe knows he has ‘ruined himself.’ So now nothing could be easier than\nto make him accept the two hundred roubles by to‐morrow, for he has\nalready vindicated his honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it\nunder foot.... He couldn’t know when he did it that I should bring it\nto him again to‐morrow, and yet he is in terrible need of that money.\nThough he is proud of himself now, yet even to‐day he’ll be thinking\nwhat a help he has lost. He will think of it more than ever at night,\nwill dream of it, and by to‐morrow morning he may be ready to run to me\nto ask forgiveness. It’s just then that I’ll appear. ‘Here, you are a\nproud man,’ I shall say: ‘you have shown it; but now take the money and\nforgive us!’ And then he will take it!”\n\nAlyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words, “And\nthen he will take it!” Lise clapped her hands.\n\n“Ah, that’s true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do\nyou know all this? So young and yet he knows what’s in the heart.... I\nshould never have worked it out.”\n\n“The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing\nwith us, in spite of his taking money from us,” Alyosha went on in his\nexcitement, “and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.”\n\n“ ‘On a higher footing’ is charming, Alexey Fyodorovitch; but go on, go\non!”\n\n“You mean there isn’t such an expression as ‘on a higher footing’; but\nthat doesn’t matter because—”\n\n“Oh, no, of course it doesn’t matter. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You\nknow, I scarcely respected you till now—that is I respected you but on\nan equal footing; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher\nfooting. Don’t be angry, dear, at my joking,” she put in at once, with\nstrong feeling. “I am absurd and small, but you, you! Listen, Alexey\nFyodorovitch. Isn’t there in all our analysis—I mean your analysis ...\nno, better call it ours—aren’t we showing contempt for him, for that\npoor man—in analyzing his soul like this, as it were, from above, eh?\nIn deciding so certainly that he will take the money?”",
            "5": "“No, Lise, it’s not contempt,” Alyosha answered, as though he had\nprepared himself for the question. “I was thinking of that on the way\nhere. How can it be contempt when we are all like him, when we are all\njust the same as he is? For you know we are just the same, no better.\nIf we are better, we should have been just the same in his place.... I\ndon’t know about you, Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in\nmany ways, and his soul is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine\nfeeling.... No, Lise, I have no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my\nelder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for\nchildren, and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals.”\n\n“Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for\nthe sick!”\n\n“Let us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself.\nI am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don’t see things.\nIt’s different with you.”\n\n“Ah, I don’t believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!”\n\n“I am so glad you say so, Lise.”\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes\nsort of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the\ndoor, open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,” said Lise,\nin a nervous, hurried whisper.\n\nAlyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening.\n\n“Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” Lise went on, flushing redder and\nredder. “Give me your hand—that’s right. I have to make a great\nconfession, I didn’t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,”\nand she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly\nashamed of the confession.\n\nSuddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times.\n\n“Ah, Lise, what a good thing!” cried Alyosha joyfully. “You know, I was\nperfectly sure you were in earnest.”\n\n“Sure? Upon my word!” She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of\nit, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. “I kiss his hand\nand he says, ‘What a good thing!’ ”\n\nBut her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome.\n\n“I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don’t know how to do\nit,” he muttered, blushing too.\n\n“Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as\nhis wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest.\nWhat a thing to say! Why, that’s impertinence—that’s what it is.”\n\n“Why, was it wrong of me to feel sure?” Alyosha asked, laughing\nsuddenly.",
            "6": "“Ah, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,” cried Lise,\nlooking tenderly and happily at him.\n\nAlyosha stood still, holding her hand in his. Suddenly he stooped down\nand kissed her on her lips.\n\n“Oh, what are you doing?” cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed.\n\n“Oh, forgive me if I shouldn’t.... Perhaps I’m awfully stupid.... You\nsaid I was cold, so I kissed you.... But I see it was stupid.”\n\nLise laughed, and hid her face in her hands. “And in that dress!” she\nejaculated in the midst of her mirth. But she suddenly ceased laughing\nand became serious, almost stern.\n\n“Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and\nwe shall have a long time to wait,” she ended suddenly. “Tell me rather\nwhy you who are so clever, so intellectual, so observant, choose a\nlittle idiot, an invalid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for\nI don’t deserve you a bit.”\n\n“You do, Lise. I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few\ndays. If I go into the world, I must marry. I know that. _He_ told me\nto marry, too. Whom could I marry better than you—and who would have me\nexcept you? I have been thinking it over. In the first place, you’ve\nknown me from a child and you’ve a great many qualities I haven’t. You\nare more light‐ hearted than I am; above all, you are more innocent\nthan I am. I have been brought into contact with many, many things\nalready.... Ah, you don’t know, but I, too, am a Karamazov. What does\nit matter if you do laugh and make jokes, and at me, too? Go on\nlaughing. I am so glad you do. You laugh like a little child, but you\nthink like a martyr.”\n\n“Like a martyr? How?”\n\n“Yes, Lise, your question just now: whether we weren’t showing contempt\nfor that poor man by dissecting his soul—that was the question of a\nsufferer.... You see, I don’t know how to express it, but any one who\nthinks of such questions is capable of suffering. Sitting in your\ninvalid chair you must have thought over many things already.”\n\n“Alyosha, give me your hand. Why are you taking it away?” murmured Lise\nin a failing voice, weak with happiness. “Listen, Alyosha. What will\nyou wear when you come out of the monastery? What sort of suit? Don’t\nlaugh, don’t be angry, it’s very, very important to me.”\n\n“I haven’t thought about the suit, Lise; but I’ll wear whatever you\nlike.”",
            "7": "“I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat, a white piqué\nwaistcoat, and a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I\ndidn’t care for you when I said I didn’t mean what I wrote?”\n\n“No, I didn’t believe it.”\n\n“Oh, you insupportable person, you are incorrigible.”\n\n“You see, I knew that you—seemed to care for me, but I pretended to\nbelieve that you didn’t care for me to make it—easier for you.”\n\n“That makes it worse! Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully\nfond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I\ndecided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly\nand gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean\nthat you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply\na stupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the\nletter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so\nas not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was\nit, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Ah, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was\nthis morning, in this pocket. Here it is.”\n\nAlyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a\ndistance.\n\n“But I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.”\n\n“Why, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!”\n\n“I told a lie if you like,” Alyosha laughed, too. “I told a lie so as\nnot to give you back the letter. It’s very precious to me,” he added\nsuddenly, with strong feeling, and again he flushed. “It always will\nbe, and I won’t give it up to any one!”\n\nLise looked at him joyfully. “Alyosha,” she murmured again, “look at\nthe door. Isn’t mamma listening?”\n\n“Very well, Lise, I’ll look; but wouldn’t it be better not to look? Why\nsuspect your mother of such meanness?”\n\n“What meanness? As for her spying on her daughter, it’s her right, it’s\nnot meanness!” cried Lise, firing up. “You may be sure, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, that when I am a mother, if I have a daughter like myself\nI shall certainly spy on her!”\n\n“Really, Lise? That’s not right.”\n\n“Oh, my goodness! What has meanness to do with it? If she were\nlistening to some ordinary worldly conversation, it would be meanness,\nbut when her own daughter is shut up with a young man.... Listen,\nAlyosha, do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married,\nand let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read them, so you\nmay as well be prepared.”\n\n“Yes, of course, if so—” muttered Alyosha, “only it’s not right.”",
            "8": "“Ah, how contemptuous! Alyosha, dear, we won’t quarrel the very first\nday. I’d better tell you the whole truth. Of course, it’s very wrong to\nspy on people, and, of course, I am not right and you are, only I shall\nspy on you all the same.”\n\n“Do, then; you won’t find out anything,” laughed Alyosha.\n\n“And, Alyosha, will you give in to me? We must decide that too.”\n\n“I shall be delighted to, Lise, and certain to, only not in the most\nimportant things. Even if you don’t agree with me, I shall do my duty\nin the most important things.”\n\n“That’s right; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not\nonly in the most important matters, but in everything. And I am ready\nto vow to do so now—in everything, and for all my life!” cried Lise\nfervently, “and I’ll do it gladly, gladly! What’s more, I’ll swear\nnever to spy on you, never once, never to read one of your letters. For\nyou are right and I am not. And though I shall be awfully tempted to\nspy, I know that I won’t do it since you consider it dishonorable. You\nare my conscience now.... Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you\nbeen so sad lately—both yesterday and to‐day? I know you have a lot of\nanxiety and trouble, but I see you have some special grief besides,\nsome secret one, perhaps?”\n\n“Yes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,” answered Alyosha mournfully. “I\nsee you love me, since you guessed that.”\n\n“What grief? What about? Can you tell me?” asked Lise with timid\nentreaty.\n\n“I’ll tell you later, Lise—afterwards,” said Alyosha, confused. “Now\nyou wouldn’t understand it perhaps—and perhaps I couldn’t explain it.”\n\n“I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.”\n\n“Yes, my brothers too,” murmured Alyosha, pondering.\n\n“I don’t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,” said Lise suddenly.\n\nHe noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it.\n\n“My brothers are destroying themselves,” he went on, “my father, too.\nAnd they are destroying others with them. It’s ‘the primitive force of\nthe Karamazovs,’ as Father Païssy said the other day, a crude,\nunbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force?\nEven that I don’t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me\na monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“And perhaps I don’t even believe in God.”",
            "9": "“You don’t believe? What is the matter?” said Lise quietly and gently.\nBut Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too\nsubjective in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but\nyet torturing him.\n\n“And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is\ngoing, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I\nam with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you,\nLise.... For the future we will be together.”\n\n“Yes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all\nour lives! Listen, kiss me, I allow you.”\n\nAlyosha kissed her.\n\n“Come, now go. Christ be with you!” and she made the sign of the cross\nover him. “Make haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see I’ve kept\nyou cruelly. I’ll pray to‐day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be\nhappy! Shall we be happy, shall we?”\n\n“I believe we shall, Lise.”\n\nAlyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going\nout of the house without saying good‐by to her. But no sooner had he\nopened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From\nthe first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to\nmeet him.\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and\nridiculous. I trust you won’t dream—It’s foolishness, nothing but\nfoolishness!” she said, attacking him at once.\n\n“Only don’t tell her that,” said Alyosha, “or she will be upset, and\nthat’s bad for her now.”\n\n“Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you\nonly agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you\ndidn’t want to irritate her by contradiction?”\n\n“Oh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,” Alyosha\ndeclared stoutly.\n\n“To be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first\nplace I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away,\nyou may be sure of that.”\n\n“But why?” asked Alyosha. “It’s all so far off. We may have to wait\nanother year and a half.”",
            "10": "“Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that’s true, of course, and you’ll have time\nto quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half. But I am\nso unhappy! Though it’s such nonsense, it’s a great blow to me. I feel\nlike Famusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky\nand she is Sofya, and, only fancy, I’ve run down to meet you on the\nstairs, and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I\nheard it all; I almost dropped. So this is the explanation of her\ndreadful night and her hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter\nbut death to the mother. I might as well be in my grave at once. And a\nmore serious matter still, what is this letter she has written? Show it\nme at once, at once!”\n\n“No, there’s no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must\nknow.”\n\n“She still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her\naunts are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs.\nHerzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn’t know what to do\nfor him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven\nhome in my carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter!\nIt’s true nothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all\nthat’s holy, in the name of your dying elder, show me that letter,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch. I’m her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like,\nand I will read it so.”\n\n“No, I won’t show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn’t. I\nam coming to‐morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but\nnow good‐by!”\n\nAnd Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street."

            "0": "He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good‐by to\nLise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to\nfind his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It\nwas getting late, nearly three o’clock. Alyosha’s whole soul turned to\nthe monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri\noutweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable\ncatastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha’s mind with\nevery hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that\nmoment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. “Even\nif my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won’t have to reproach\nmyself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something\nand did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I\nshall be following his great precept.”\n\nHis plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the\nfence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the\nsummer‐house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not\nannounce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain\nhidden in the summer‐house, even if he had to wait there till evening.\nIf, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he\nwould be very likely to come to the summer‐house. Alyosha did not,\nhowever, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to\nact upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that\nday.\n\nEverything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle\nalmost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the\nsummer‐house unseen. He did not want to be noticed. The woman of the\nhouse and Foma too, if he were here, might be loyal to his brother and\nobey his instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the\ngarden, or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for.",
            "1": "There was no one in the summer‐house. Alyosha sat down and began to\nwait. He looked round the summer‐house, which somehow struck him as a\ngreat deal more ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as\nyesterday, it seemed a wretched little place this time. There was a\ncircle on the table, left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been\nspilt the day before. Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his\nmind, as they always do in a time of tedious waiting. He wondered, for\ninstance, why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before,\nwhy not in the other seat. At last he felt very depressed—depressed by\nsuspense and uncertainty. But he had not sat there more than a quarter\nof an hour, when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere\nquite close. People were sitting, or had only just sat down, somewhere\nin the bushes not more than twenty paces away. Alyosha suddenly\nrecollected that on coming out of the summer‐house the day before, he\nhad caught a glimpse of an old green low garden‐seat among the bushes\non the left, by the fence. The people must be sitting on it now. Who\nwere they?\n\nA man’s voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying\nhimself on the guitar:\n\nWith invincible force\nI am bound to my dear.\nO Lord, have mercy\nOn her and on me!\nOn her and on me!\nOn her and on me!\n\n\nThe voice ceased. It was a lackey’s tenor and a lackey’s song. Another\nvoice, a woman’s, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though\nwith mincing affectation:\n\n“Why haven’t you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch? Why do\nyou always look down upon us?”\n\n“Not at all,” answered a man’s voice politely, but with emphatic\ndignity. It was clear that the man had the best of the position, and\nthat the woman was making advances. “I believe the man must be\nSmerdyakov,” thought Alyosha, “from his voice. And the lady must be the\ndaughter of the house here, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears\nthe dress with a tail and goes to Marfa for soup.”\n\n“I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,” the woman’s\nvoice continued. “Why don’t you go on?”\n\nThe man sang again:\n\nWhat do I care for royal wealth\nIf but my dear one be in health?\nLord have mercy\nOn her and on me!\nOn her and on me!\nOn her and on me!\n\n\n“It was even better last time,” observed the woman’s voice. “You sang\n‘If my darling be in health’; it sounded more tender. I suppose you’ve\nforgotten to‐day.”\n\n“Poetry is rubbish!” said Smerdyakov curtly.",
            "2": "“Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.”\n\n“So far as it’s poetry, it’s essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who\never talks in rhyme? And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though\nit were decreed by government, we shouldn’t say much, should we? Poetry\nis no good, Marya Kondratyevna.”\n\n“How clever you are! How is it you’ve gone so deep into everything?”\nThe woman’s voice was more and more insinuating.\n\n“I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that,\nif it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up. I would have\nshot a man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from\na filthy beggar and have no father. And they used to throw it in my\nteeth in Moscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory\nVassilyevitch. Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my\nbirth, but I would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born\nthat I might not have come into the world at all. They used to say in\nthe market, and your mamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off\ntelling me that her hair was like a mat on her head, and that she was\nshort of five foot by a wee bit. Why talk of a wee bit while she might\nhave said ‘a little bit,’ like every one else? She wanted to make it\ntouching, a regular peasant’s feeling. Can a Russian peasant be said to\nfeel, in comparison with an educated man? He can’t be said to have\nfeeling at all, in his ignorance. From my childhood up when I hear ‘a\nwee bit,’ I am ready to burst with rage. I hate all Russia, Marya\nKondratyevna.”\n\n“If you’d been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn’t\nhave talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all\nRussia.”\n\n“I don’t want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what’s more, I\nshould like to abolish all soldiers.”\n\n“And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?”\n\n“There’s no need of defense. In 1812 there was a great invasion of\nRussia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present\none, and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us. A\nclever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it. We\nshould have had quite different institutions.”\n\n“Are they so much better in their own country than we are? I wouldn’t\nchange a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,” observed Marya\nKondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her words with a most\nlanguishing glance.\n\n“That’s as one prefers.”",
            "3": "“But you are just like a foreigner—just like a most gentlemanly\nforeigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.”\n\n“If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in\ntheir vice. They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished\nboots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it. The Russian\npeople want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday,\nthough he is mad, and all his children.”\n\n“You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“But he said I was a stinking lackey. He thinks that I might be unruly.\nHe is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have\nleft here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his\nbehavior, in his mind, and in his poverty. He doesn’t know how to do\nanything, and yet he is respected by every one. I may be only a soup‐\nmaker, but with luck I could open a café restaurant in Petrovka, in\nMoscow, for my cookery is something special, and there’s no one in\nMoscow, except the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special.\nDmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he were to challenge the son of\nthe first count in the country, he’d fight him. Though in what way is\nhe better than I am? For he is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at\nthe money he has wasted without any need!”\n\n“It must be lovely, a duel,” Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.\n\n“How so?”\n\n“It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers\nwith pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some\nlady. A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I’d\ngive anything to see one!”\n\n“It’s all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he is\nfiring straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly. You’d be glad\nto run away, Marya Kondratyevna.”\n\n“You don’t mean you would run away?” But Smerdyakov did not deign to\nreply. After a moment’s silence the guitar tinkled again, and he sang\nagain in the same falsetto:\n\nWhatever you may say,\nI shall go far away.\nLife will be bright and gay\nIn the city far away.\nI shall not grieve,\nI shall not grieve at all,\nI don’t intend to grieve at all.",
            "4": "\nThen something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were\nsilent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He found Smerdyakov\ndressed up and wearing polished boots, his hair pomaded, and perhaps\ncurled. The guitar lay on the garden‐seat. His companion was the\ndaughter of the house, wearing a light‐blue dress with a train two\nyards long. She was young and would not have been bad‐looking, but that\nher face was so round and terribly freckled.\n\n“Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?” asked Alyosha with as much\ncomposure as he could.\n\nSmerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too.\n\n“How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It’s not as if I were his\nkeeper,” answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.\n\n“But I simply asked whether you do know?” Alyosha explained.\n\n“I know nothing of his whereabouts and don’t want to.”\n\n“But my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the\nhouse, and promised to let him know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.”\n\nSmerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him.\n\n“And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour\nago?” he asked, looking at Alyosha.\n\n“I came in from the back‐alley, over the fence, and went straight to\nthe summer‐house. I hope you’ll forgive me,” he added, addressing Marya\nKondratyevna. “I was in a hurry to find my brother.”\n\n“Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!” drawled Marya\nKondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha’s apology. “For Dmitri Fyodorovitch\noften goes to the summer‐house in that way. We don’t know he is here\nand he is sitting in the summer‐house.”\n\n“I am very anxious to find him, or to learn from you where he is now.\nBelieve me, it’s on business of great importance to him.”\n\n“He never tells us,” lisped Marya Kondratyevna.\n\n“Though I used to come here as a friend,” Smerdyakov began again,\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by\nhis incessant questions about the master. ‘What news?’ he’ll ask.\n‘What’s going on in there now? Who’s coming and going?’ and can’t I\ntell him something more. Twice already he’s threatened me with death.”\n\n“With death?” Alyosha exclaimed in surprise.",
            "5": "“Do you suppose he’d think much of that, with his temper, which you had\na chance of observing yourself yesterday? He says if I let Agrafena\nAlexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I’ll be the first to\nsuffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more\nafraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what\nhe might not do!”\n\n“His honor said to him the other day, ‘I’ll pound you in a mortar!’ ”\nadded Marya Kondratyevna.\n\n“Oh, if it’s pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,” observed\nAlyosha. “If I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.”\n\n“Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,” said Smerdyakov, as\nthough thinking better of it; “I am here as an old friend and neighbor,\nand it would be odd if I didn’t come. On the other hand, Ivan\nFyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother’s lodging\nin Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri\nFyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in the\nmarket‐place. I went, but didn’t find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home,\nthough it was eight o’clock. ‘He’s been here, but he is quite gone,’\nthose were the very words of his landlady. It’s as though there was an\nunderstanding between them. Perhaps at this moment he is in the\nrestaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been\nhome to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago, and is\ngone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me\nand of what I have told you, for he’d kill me for nothing at all.”\n\n“Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to‐day?” repeated\nAlyosha quickly.\n\n“That’s so.”\n\n“The Metropolis tavern in the market‐place?”\n\n“The very same.”\n\n“That’s quite likely,” cried Alyosha, much excited. “Thank you,\nSmerdyakov; that’s important. I’ll go there at once.”\n\n“Don’t betray me,” Smerdyakov called after him.\n\n“Oh, no, I’ll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don’t be anxious.”\n\n“But wait a minute, I’ll open the gate to you,” cried Marya\nKondratyevna.\n\n“No; it’s a short cut, I’ll get over the fence again.”\n\nWhat he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the\ntavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic\ndress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call\nthem down. But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open,\nand his brother Ivan called down to him from it.\n\n“Alyosha, can’t you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.”",
            "6": "“To be sure I can, only I don’t quite know whether in this dress—”\n\n“But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I’ll run down to meet\nyou.”\n\nA minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone\ndining."

            "0": "Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off\nby a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was\nthe first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters\nwere continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the\nroom was an old retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But\nthere was the usual bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern;\nthere were shouts for the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the\nclick of billiard balls, the drone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan\ndid not usually visit this tavern and disliked taverns in general. So\nhe must have come here, he reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by\narrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there.\n\n“Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don’t live on tea alone,\nI suppose,” cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of\nAlyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking tea.\n\n“Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,” said Alyosha\ngayly.\n\n“And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love\ncherry jam when you were little?”\n\n“You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still.”\n\nIvan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.\n\n“I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I\nwas nearly fifteen. There’s such a difference between fifteen and\neleven that brothers are never companions at those ages. I don’t know\nwhether I was fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the\nfirst few years I never thought of you at all. Then, when you came to\nMoscow yourself, we only met once somewhere, I believe. And now I’ve\nbeen here more than three months, and so far we have scarcely said a\nword to each other. To‐morrow I am going away, and I was just thinking\nas I sat here how I could see you to say good‐by and just then you\npassed.”\n\n“Were you very anxious to see me, then?”",
            "1": "“Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know\nme. And then to say good‐by. I believe it’s always best to get to know\npeople just before leaving them. I’ve noticed how you’ve been looking\nat me these three months. There has been a continual look of\nexpectation in your eyes, and I can’t endure that. That’s how it is\nI’ve kept away from you. But in the end I have learned to respect you.\nThe little man stands firm, I thought. Though I am laughing, I am\nserious. You do stand firm, don’t you? I like people who are firm like\nthat whatever it is they stand by, even if they are such little fellows\nas you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in\nthe end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love me for some reason,\nAlyosha?”\n\n“I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you—Ivan is a tomb! I say of you,\nIvan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand\nsomething in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.”\n\n“What’s that?” laughed Ivan.\n\n“You won’t be angry?” Alyosha laughed too.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty,\nthat you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now,\nhave I insulted you dreadfully?”",
            "2": "“On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,” cried Ivan, warmly and\ngood‐humoredly. “Would you believe it that ever since that scene with\nher, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just\nas though you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I’ve been\nsitting here thinking to myself: that if I didn’t believe in life, if I\nlost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were\nconvinced in fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and\nperhaps devil‐ridden chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man’s\ndisillusionment—still I should want to live and, having once tasted of\nthe cup, I would not turn away from it till I had drained it! At\nthirty, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I’ve not\nemptied it, and turn away—where I don’t know. But till I am thirty, I\nknow that my youth will triumph over everything—every disillusionment,\nevery disgust with life. I’ve asked myself many times whether there is\nin the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps\nunseemly thirst for life in me, and I’ve come to the conclusion that\nthere isn’t, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of\nmyself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists—and poets\nespecially—often call that thirst for life base. It’s a feature of the\nKaramazovs, it’s true, that thirst for life regardless of everything;\nyou have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on\nour planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for\nlife, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in\nthe order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they\nopen in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves\nyou know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by\nmen, though I’ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from\nold habit one’s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for\nyou, eat it, it will do you good. It’s first‐rate soup, they know how\nto make it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off\nfrom here. And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it’s\na most precious graveyard, that’s what it is! Precious are the dead\nthat lie there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in\nthe past, of such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their\nstruggle and their science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and\nkiss those stones and weep over them; though I’m convinced in my heart\nthat it’s long been nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from\ndespair, but simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep\nmy soul in my emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue\nsky—that’s all it is. It’s not a matter of intellect or logic, it’s\nloving with one’s inside, with one’s stomach. One loves the first\nstrength of one’s youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade,\nAlyosha?” Ivan laughed suddenly.",
            "3": "“I understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one’s inside, with\none’s stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you\nhave such a longing for life,” cried Alyosha. “I think every one should\nlove life above everything in the world.”\n\n“Love life more than the meaning of it?”\n\n“Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be\nregardless of logic, and it’s only then one will understand the meaning\nof it. I have thought so a long time. Half your work is done, Ivan, you\nlove life, now you’ve only to try to do the second half and you are\nsaved.”\n\n“You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does\nyour second half mean?”\n\n“Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after\nall. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.”\n\n“I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such _professions\nde foi_ from such—novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey. Is it\ntrue that you mean to leave the monastery?”\n\n“Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.”\n\n“We shall see each other then in the world. We shall meet before I am\nthirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. Father doesn’t\nwant to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy, he dreams of\nhanging on to eighty in fact, so he says. He means it only too\nseriously, though he is a buffoon. He stands on a firm rock, too, he\nstands on his sensuality—though after we are thirty, indeed, there may\nbe nothing else to stand on.... But to hang on to seventy is nasty,\nbetter only to thirty; one might retain ‘a shadow of nobility’ by\ndeceiving oneself. Have you seen Dmitri to‐day?”\n\n“No, but I saw Smerdyakov,” and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely,\ndescribed his meeting with Smerdyakov. Ivan began listening anxiously\nand questioned him.\n\n“But he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,”\nadded Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered.\n\n“Are you frowning on Smerdyakov’s account?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“Yes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but\nnow there’s no need,” said Ivan reluctantly.\n\n“But are you really going so soon, brother?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?” asked Alyosha anxiously.",
            "4": "“You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my\nbrother Dmitri’s keeper?” Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly\nsmiled bitterly. “Cain’s answer about his murdered brother, wasn’t it?\nPerhaps that’s what you’re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all,\nI can’t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I’ve finished what I had\nto do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I’ve\nbeen trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three\nmonths? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going.\nI finished it just now, you were witness.”\n\n“At Katerina Ivanovna’s?”\n\n“Yes, and I’ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I\nto do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn’t come in. I had my own business to\nsettle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri\nbehaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn’t ask\nhim to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his\nblessing. It’s all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light\nmy heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and\nwas nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom.\nTfoo! It’s been going on nearly six months, and all at once I’ve thrown\nit off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be\nto put an end to it if I wanted.”\n\n“You are speaking of your love, Ivan?”\n\n“Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried\nmyself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all\nat once it’s collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I\nwent away and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it’s the\nliteral truth.”\n\n“You seem very merry about it now,” observed Alyosha, looking into his\nface, which had suddenly grown brighter.\n\n“But how could I tell that I didn’t care for her a bit! Ha ha! It\nappears after all I didn’t. And yet how she attracted me! How\nattractive she was just now when I made my speech! And do you know she\nattracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you\nthink I am boasting?”\n\n“No, only perhaps it wasn’t love.”",
            "5": "“Alyosha,” laughed Ivan, “don’t make reflections about love, it’s\nunseemly for you. How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I’ve\nforgotten to kiss you for it.... But how she tormented me! It certainly\nwas sitting by a ‘laceration.’ Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved\nme and not Dmitri,” Ivan insisted gayly. “Her feeling for Dmitri was\nsimply a self‐ laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true,\nbut the worst of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find\nout that she doesn’t care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments,\nand perhaps she may never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson\nto‐day. Well, it’s better so; I can simply go away for good. By the\nway, how is she now? What happened after I departed?”\n\nAlyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he\nheard, unconscious and delirious.\n\n“Isn’t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?”\n\n“I think not.”\n\n“I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don’t matter.\nGod gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won’t go to her at all. Why\npush myself forward again?”\n\n“But you told her that she had never cared for you.”\n\n“I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let\nus drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!”\n\n“No, brother, we had better not drink,” said Alyosha suddenly. “Besides\nI feel somehow depressed.”\n\n“Yes, you’ve been depressed a long time, I’ve noticed it.”\n\n“Have you settled to go to‐morrow morning, then?”\n\n“Morning? I didn’t say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it\nmay be the morning. Would you believe it, I dined here to‐day only to\navoid dining with the old man, I loathe him so. I should have left long\nago, so far as he is concerned. But why are you so worried about my\ngoing away? We’ve plenty of time before I go, an eternity!”\n\n“If you are going away to‐morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?”\n\n“But what does it matter to us?” laughed Ivan. “We’ve time enough for\nour talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised?\nAnswer: why have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna,\nof the old man and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of\nRussia? Of the Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?”\n\n“No.”",
            "6": "“Then you know what for. It’s different for other people; but we in our\ngreen youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all. That’s\nwhat we care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the\neternal questions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with\npractical questions. Why have you been looking at me in expectation for\nthe last three months? To ask me, ‘What do you believe, or don’t you\nbelieve at all?’ That’s what your eyes have been meaning for these\nthree months, haven’t they?”\n\n“Perhaps so,” smiled Alyosha. “You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?”\n\n“Me laughing! I don’t want to wound my little brother who has been\nwatching me with such expectation for three months. Alyosha, look\nstraight at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only\nnot a novice. And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some\nof them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet\nand sit down in a corner. They’ve never met in their lives before and,\nwhen they go out of the tavern, they won’t meet again for forty years.\nAnd what do they talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of\nthe eternal questions, of the existence of God and immortality. And\nthose who do not believe in God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the\ntransformation of all humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes\nto the same, they’re the same questions turned inside out. And masses,\nmasses of the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the\neternal questions! Isn’t it so?”\n\n“Yes, for real Russians the questions of God’s existence and of\nimmortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come\nfirst and foremost, of course, and so they should,” said Alyosha, still\nwatching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.\n\n“Well, Alyosha, it’s sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but\nanything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can\nhardly imagine. But there’s one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully\nfond of.”\n\n“How nicely you put that in!” Alyosha laughed suddenly.\n\n“Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God,\neh?”\n\n“Begin where you like. You declared yesterday at father’s that there\nwas no God.” Alyosha looked searchingly at his brother.",
            "7": "“I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you and I saw your\neyes glow. But now I’ve no objection to discussing with you, and I say\nso very seriously. I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have\nno friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept\nGod,” laughed Ivan; “that’s a surprise for you, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.”",
            "8": "“Joking? I was told at the elder’s yesterday that I was joking. You\nknow, dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who\ndeclared that, if there were no God, he would have to be invented.\n_S’il n’existait pas Dieu, il faudrait l’inventer._ And man has\nactually invented God. And what’s strange, what would be marvelous, is\nnot that God should really exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the\nidea of the necessity of God, could enter the head of such a savage,\nvicious beast as man. So holy it is, so touching, so wise and so great\na credit it does to man. As for me, I’ve long resolved not to think\nwhether man created God or God man. And I won’t go through all the\naxioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject, all derived from\nEuropean hypotheses; for what’s a hypothesis there, is an axiom with\nthe Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their teachers\ntoo, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys\nthemselves. And so I omit all the hypotheses. For what are we aiming at\nnow? I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature,\nthat is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I\nhope, that’s it, isn’t it? And therefore I tell you that I accept God\nsimply. But you must note this: if God exists and if He really did\ncreate the world, then, as we all know, He created it according to the\ngeometry of Euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three\ndimensions in space. Yet there have been and still are geometricians\nand philosophers, and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt\nwhether the whole universe, or to speak more widely the whole of being,\nwas only created in Euclid’s geometry; they even dare to dream that two\nparallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may\nmeet somewhere in infinity. I have come to the conclusion that, since I\ncan’t understand even that, I can’t expect to understand about God. I\nacknowledge humbly that I have no faculty for settling such questions,\nI have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that\nare not of this world? And I advise you never to think about it either,\nmy dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He exists or not. All\nsuch questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an\nidea of only three dimensions. And so I accept God and am glad to, and\nwhat’s more, I accept His wisdom, His purpose—which are utterly beyond\nour ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I\nbelieve in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be\nblended. I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and\nWhich Itself was ‘with God,’ and Which Itself is God and so on, and so\non, to infinity. There are all sorts of phrases for it. I seem to be on\nthe right path, don’t I? Yet would you believe it, in the final result\nI don’t accept this world of God’s, and, although I know it exists, I\ndon’t accept it at all. It’s not that I don’t accept God, you must\nunderstand, it’s the world created by Him I don’t and cannot accept.\nLet me make it plain. I believe like a child that suffering will be\nhealed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human\ncontradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable\nfabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind of man,\nthat in the world’s finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something\nso precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for\nthe comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes\nof humanity, of all the blood they’ve shed; that it will make it not\nonly possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with\nmen—but though all that may come to pass, I don’t accept it. I won’t\naccept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall\nsee it and say that they’ve met, but still I won’t accept it. That’s\nwhat’s at the root of me, Alyosha; that’s my creed. I am in earnest in\nwhat I say. I began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but\nI’ve led up to my confession, for that’s all you want. You didn’t want\nto hear about God, but only to know what the brother you love lives by.\nAnd so I’ve told you.”",
            "9": "Ivan concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling.\n\n“And why did you begin ‘as stupidly as you could’?” asked Alyosha,\nlooking dreamily at him.\n\n“To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on\nsuch subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly. And\nsecondly, the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The\nstupider one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless,\nwhile intelligence wriggles and hides itself. Intelligence is a knave,\nbut stupidity is honest and straightforward. I’ve led the conversation\nto my despair, and the more stupidly I have presented it, the better\nfor me.”\n\n“You will explain why you don’t accept the world?” said Alyosha.\n\n“To be sure I will, it’s not a secret, that’s what I’ve been leading up\nto. Dear little brother, I don’t want to corrupt you or to turn you\nfrom your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.” Ivan smiled\nsuddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such\na smile on his face before."

            "0": "“I must make you one confession,” Ivan began. “I could never understand\nhow one can love one’s neighbors. It’s just one’s neighbors, to my\nmind, that one can’t love, though one might love those at a distance. I\nonce read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry,\nfrozen beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his\narms, and began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and\nloathsome from some awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from\n‘self‐laceration,’ from the self‐laceration of falsity, for the sake of\nthe charity imposed by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to\nlove a man, he must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love\nis gone.”\n\n“Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,” observed Alyosha;\n“he, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not\npracticed in love, from loving him. But yet there’s a great deal of\nlove in mankind, and almost Christ‐like love. I know that myself,\nIvan.”",
            "1": "“Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can’t understand it, and the\ninnumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether\nthat’s due to men’s bad qualities or whether it’s inherent in their\nnature. To my thinking, Christ‐like love for men is a miracle\nimpossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for\ninstance, suffer intensely. Another can never know how much I suffer,\nbecause he is another and not I. And what’s more, a man is rarely ready\nto admit another’s suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why\nwon’t he admit it, do you think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I\nhave a stupid face, because I once trod on his foot. Besides, there is\nsuffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as\nhumbles me—hunger, for instance—my benefactor will perhaps allow me;\nbut when you come to higher suffering—for an idea, for instance—he will\nvery rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at\nall what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so\nhe deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness of\nheart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show\nthemselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can love\none’s neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at close\nquarters it’s almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in the\nballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered\nlace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like looking\nat them. But even then we should not love them. But enough of that. I\nsimply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to speak of the\nsuffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine ourselves to\nthe sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my argument\nto a tenth of what it would be. Still we’d better keep to the children,\nthough it does weaken my case. But, in the first place, children can be\nloved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when they\nare ugly (I fancy, though, children never are ugly). The second reason\nwhy I won’t speak of grown‐up people is that, besides being disgusting\nand unworthy of love, they have a compensation—they’ve eaten the apple\nand know good and evil, and they have become ‘like gods.’ They go on\neating it still. But the children haven’t eaten anything, and are so\nfar innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and\nyou will understand why I prefer to speak of them. If they, too, suffer\nhorribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers’ sins, they must\nbe punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that\nreasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart\nof man here on earth. The innocent must not suffer for another’s sins,\nand especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but\nI am awfully fond of children, too. And observe, cruel people, the\nviolent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of\nchildren. Children while they are quite little—up to seven, for\ninstance—are so remote from grown‐up people; they are different\ncreatures, as it were, of a different species. I knew a criminal in\nprison who had, in the course of his career as a burglar, murdered\nwhole families, including several children. But when he was in prison,\nhe had a strange affection for them. He spent all his time at his\nwindow, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He trained\none little boy to come up to his window and made great friends with\nhim.... You don’t know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My head\naches and I am sad.”",
            "2": "“You speak with a strange air,” observed Alyosha uneasily, “as though\nyou were not quite yourself.”\n\n“By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,” Ivan went on, seeming\nnot to hear his brother’s words, “told me about the crimes committed by\nTurks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a\ngeneral rising of the Slavs. They burn villages, murder, outrage women\nand children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences,\nleave them so till morning, and in the morning they hang them—all sorts\nof things you can’t imagine. People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty,\nbut that’s a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can\nnever be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears\nand gnaws, that’s all he can do. He would never think of nailing people\nby the ears, even if he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure\nin torturing children, too; cutting the unborn child from the mother’s\nwomb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points\nof their bayonets before their mothers’ eyes. Doing it before the\nmothers’ eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another\nscene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with\nher baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They’ve\nplanned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They\nsucceed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four\ninches from the baby’s face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its\nlittle hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby’s face\nand blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn’t it? By the way, Turks are\nparticularly fond of sweet things, they say.”\n\n“Brother, what are you driving at?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“I think if the devil doesn’t exist, but man has created him, he has\ncreated him in his own image and likeness.”\n\n“Just as he did God, then?” observed Alyosha.",
            "3": "“ ‘It’s wonderful how you can turn words,’ as Polonius says in\n_Hamlet_,” laughed Ivan. “You turn my words against me. Well, I am\nglad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him in his image and\nlikeness. You asked just now what I was driving at. You see, I am fond\nof collecting certain facts, and, would you believe, I even copy\nanecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books, and I’ve already\ngot a fine collection. The Turks, of course, have gone into it, but\nthey are foreigners. I have specimens from home that are even better\nthan the Turks. You know we prefer beating—rods and scourges—that’s our\nnational institution. Nailing ears is unthinkable for us, for we are,\nafter all, Europeans. But the rod and the scourge we have always with\nus and they cannot be taken from us. Abroad now they scarcely do any\nbeating. Manners are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that\nthey don’t dare to flog men now. But they make up for it in another way\njust as national as ours. And so national that it would be practically\nimpossible among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it,\nsince the religious movement began in our aristocracy. I have a\ncharming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how, quite\nrecently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed—a young\nman, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to\nthe Christian faith at the very scaffold. This Richard was an\nillegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his parents to\nsome shepherds on the Swiss mountains. They brought him up to work for\nthem. He grew up like a little wild beast among them. The shepherds\ntaught him nothing, and scarcely fed or clothed him, but sent him out\nat seven to herd the flock in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or\nscrupled to treat him so. Quite the contrary, they thought they had\nevery right, for Richard had been given to them as a chattel, and they\ndid not even see the necessity of feeding him. Richard himself\ndescribes how in those years, like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he\nlonged to eat of the mash given to the pigs, which were fattened for\nsale. But they wouldn’t even give him that, and beat him when he stole\nfrom the pigs. And that was how he spent all his childhood and his\nyouth, till he grew up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief.\nThe savage began to earn his living as a day laborer in Geneva. He\ndrank what he earned, he lived like a brute, and finished by killing\nand robbing an old man. He was caught, tried, and condemned to death.\nThey are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he was immediately\nsurrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic\nladies, and the like. They taught him to read and write in prison, and\nexpounded the Gospel to him. They exhorted him, worked upon him,\ndrummed at him incessantly, till at last he solemnly confessed his\ncrime. He was converted. He wrote to the court himself that he was a\nmonster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him light and shown\ngrace. All Geneva was in excitement about him—all philanthropic and\nreligious Geneva. All the aristocratic and well‐bred society of the\ntown rushed to the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him; ‘You are\nour brother, you have found grace.’ And Richard does nothing but weep\nwith emotion, ‘Yes, I’ve found grace! All my youth and childhood I was\nglad of pigs’ food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the\nLord.’ ‘Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must\ndie. Though it’s not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when you\ncoveted the pigs’ food and were beaten for stealing it (which was very\nwrong of you, for stealing is forbidden); but you’ve shed blood and you\nmust die.’ And on the last day, Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing\nbut cry and repeat every minute: ‘This is my happiest day. I am going\nto the Lord.’ ‘Yes,’ cry the pastors and the judges and philanthropic\nladies. ‘This is the happiest day of your life, for you are going to\nthe Lord!’ They all walk or drive to the scaffold in procession behind\nthe prison van. At the scaffold they call to Richard: ‘Die, brother,\ndie in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!’ And so, covered with\nhis brothers’ kisses, Richard is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to\nthe guillotine. And they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion,\nbecause he had found grace. Yes, that’s characteristic. That pamphlet\nis translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists of\naristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed\ngratis for the enlightenment of the people. The case of Richard is\ninteresting because it’s national. Though to us it’s absurd to cut off\na man’s head, because he has become our brother and has found grace,\nyet we have our own speciality, which is all but worse. Our historical\npastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. There are lines\nin Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, ‘on\nits meek eyes,’ every one must have seen it. It’s peculiarly Russian.\nHe describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a\nload and cannot move. The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it\nat last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty,\nthrashes it mercilessly over and over again. ‘However weak you are, you\nmust pull, if you die for it.’ The nag strains, and then he begins\nlashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping, on its ‘meek\neyes.’ The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all over,\ngasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural spasmodic\naction—it’s awful in Nekrassov. But that’s only a horse, and God has\ngiven horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught us, and they left\nus the knout as a remembrance of it. But men, too, can be beaten. A\nwell‐educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own child\nwith a birch‐rod, a girl of seven. I have an exact account of it. The\npapa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. ‘It stings more,’\nsaid he, and so he began stinging his daughter. I know for a fact there\nare people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal\nsensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict.\nThey beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often\nand more savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream,\nit gasps, ‘Daddy! daddy!’ By some diabolical unseemly chance the case\nwas brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have\nlong called a barrister ‘a conscience for hire.’ The counsel protests\nin his client’s defense. ‘It’s such a simple thing,’ he says, ‘an\neveryday domestic event. A father corrects his child. To our shame be\nit said, it is brought into court.’ The jury, convinced by him, give a\nfavorable verdict. The public roars with delight that the torturer is\nacquitted. Ah, pity I wasn’t there! I would have proposed to raise a\nsubscription in his honor! Charming pictures.",
            "4": "“But I’ve still better things about children. I’ve collected a great,\ngreat deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of\nfive who was hated by her father and mother, ‘most worthy and\nrespectable people, of good education and breeding.’ You see, I must\nrepeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love\nof torturing children, and children only. To all other types of\nhumanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like\ncultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting\nchildren, even fond of children themselves in that sense. It’s just\ntheir defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic\nconfidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal, that sets his\nvile blood on fire. In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden—the\ndemon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured\nvictim, the demon of lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of\ndiseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.\n\n“This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by\nthose cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for\nno reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater\nrefinements of cruelty—shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a\nprivy, and because she didn’t ask to be taken up at night (as though a\nchild of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to\nwake and ask), they smeared her face and filled her mouth with\nexcrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother\ncould sleep, hearing the poor child’s groans! Can you understand why a\nlittle creature, who can’t even understand what’s done to her, should\nbeat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the\ncold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect\nher? Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble\nnovice? Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted?\nWithout it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he\ncould not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical\ngood and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge\nis not worth that child’s prayer to ‘dear, kind God’! I say nothing of\nthe sufferings of grown‐up people, they have eaten the apple, damn\nthem, and the devil take them all! But these little ones! I am making\nyou suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I’ll leave off if you like.”",
            "5": "“Never mind. I want to suffer too,” muttered Alyosha.\n\n“One picture, only one more, because it’s so curious, so\ncharacteristic, and I have only just read it in some collection of\nRussian antiquities. I’ve forgotten the name. I must look it up. It was\nin the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and\nlong live the Liberator of the People! There was in those days a\ngeneral of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one of\nthose men—somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then—who, retiring from\nthe service into a life of leisure, are convinced that they’ve earned\nabsolute power over the lives of their subjects. There were such men\nthen. So our general, settled on his property of two thousand souls,\nlives in pomp, and domineers over his poor neighbors as though they\nwere dependents and buffoons. He has kennels of hundreds of hounds and\nnearly a hundred dog‐boys—all mounted, and in uniform. One day a\nserf‐boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in play and hurt the\npaw of the general’s favorite hound. ‘Why is my favorite dog lame?’ He\nis told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog’s paw. ‘So you did\nit.’ The general looked the child up and down. ‘Take him.’ He was\ntaken—taken from his mother and kept shut up all night. Early that\nmorning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his\ndependents, dog‐boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him in full\nhunting parade. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in\nfront of them all stands the mother of the child. The child is brought\nfrom the lock‐up. It’s a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day\nfor hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is\nstripped naked. He shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry....\n‘Make him run,’ commands the general. ‘Run! run!’ shout the dog‐boys.\nThe boy runs.... ‘At him!’ yells the general, and he sets the whole\npack of hounds on the child. The hounds catch him, and tear him to\npieces before his mother’s eyes!... I believe the general was\nafterwards declared incapable of administering his estates. Well—what\ndid he deserve? To be shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our\nmoral feelings? Speak, Alyosha!”\n\n“To be shot,” murmured Alyosha, lifting his eyes to Ivan with a pale,\ntwisted smile.\n\n“Bravo!” cried Ivan, delighted. “If even you say so.... You’re a pretty\nmonk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha\nKaramazov!”\n\n“What I said was absurd, but—”",
            "6": "“That’s just the point, that ‘but’!” cried Ivan. “Let me tell you,\nnovice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth. The world\nstands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in\nit without them. We know what we know!”\n\n“What do you know?”\n\n“I understand nothing,” Ivan went on, as though in delirium. “I don’t\nwant to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up\nmy mind long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I\nshall be false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the\nfact.”\n\n“Why are you trying me?” Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. “Will you\nsay what you mean at last?”\n\n“Of course, I will; that’s what I’ve been leading up to. You are dear\nto me, I don’t want to let you go, and I won’t give you up to your\nZossima.”\n\nIvan for a minute was silent, his face became all at once very sad.",
            "7": "“Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer. Of\nthe other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its\ncrust to its center, I will say nothing. I have narrowed my subject on\npurpose. I am a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot\nunderstand why the world is arranged as it is. Men are themselves to\nblame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and\nstole fire from heaven, though they knew they would become unhappy, so\nthere is no need to pity them. With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian\nunderstanding, all I know is that there is suffering and that there are\nnone guilty; that cause follows effect, simply and directly; that\neverything flows and finds its level—but that’s only Euclidian\nnonsense, I know that, and I can’t consent to live by it! What comfort\nis it to me that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect\nsimply and directly, and that I know it?—I must have justice, or I will\ndestroy myself. And not justice in some remote infinite time and space,\nbut here on earth, and that I could see myself. I have believed in it.\nI want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if\nit all happens without me, it will be too unfair. Surely I haven’t\nsuffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the\nsoil of the future harmony for somebody else. I want to see with my own\neyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace\nhis murderer. I want to be there when every one suddenly understands\nwhat it has all been for. All the religions of the world are built on\nthis longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the children, and\nwhat am I to do about them? That’s a question I can’t answer. For the\nhundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I’ve only\ntaken the children, because in their case what I mean is so\nunanswerably clear. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal\nharmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It’s beyond\nall comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for\nthe harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil\nfor the harmony of the future? I understand solidarity in sin among\nmen. I understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no\nsuch solidarity with children. And if it is really true that they must\nshare responsibility for all their fathers’ crimes, such a truth is not\nof this world and is beyond my comprehension. Some jester will say,\nperhaps, that the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you\nsee he didn’t grow up, he was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight\nyears old. Oh, Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! I understand, of course,\nwhat an upheaval of the universe it will be, when everything in heaven\nand earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and\nhas lived cries aloud: ‘Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are\nrevealed.’ When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to\nthe dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, ‘Thou art just, O Lord!’\nthen, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be\nmade clear. But what pulls me up here is that I can’t accept that\nharmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own measures.\nYou see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I live to that\nmoment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry aloud with\nthe rest, looking at the mother embracing the child’s torturer, ‘Thou\nart just, O Lord!’ but I don’t want to cry aloud then. While there is\nstill time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher\nharmony altogether. It’s not worth the tears of that one tortured child\nwho beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its\nstinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to ‘dear, kind God’! It’s\nnot worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned\nfor, or there can be no harmony. But how? How are you going to atone\nfor them? Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care\nfor avenging them? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good\ncan hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And what\nbecomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to\nembrace. I don’t want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children\ngo to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth,\nthen I protest that the truth is not worth such a price. I don’t want\nthe mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She\ndare not forgive him! Let her forgive him for herself, if she will, let\nher forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother’s\nheart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to\nforgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to\nforgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes\nof harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the\nright to forgive and could forgive? I don’t want harmony. From love for\nhumanity I don’t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged\nsuffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and\nunsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_. Besides, too high a\nprice is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means to pay so much to\nenter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I\nam an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And\nthat I am doing. It’s not God that I don’t accept, Alyosha, only I most\nrespectfully return Him the ticket.”",
            "8": "“That’s rebellion,” murmured Alyosha, looking down.\n\n“Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,” said Ivan earnestly. “One can\nhardly live in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me yourself, I\nchallenge you—answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human\ndestiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them\npeace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to\ntorture to death only one tiny creature—that baby beating its breast\nwith its fist, for instance—and to found that edifice on its unavenged\ntears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell\nme, and tell the truth.”\n\n“No, I wouldn’t consent,” said Alyosha softly.\n\n“And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would\nagree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated\nblood of a little victim? And accepting it would remain happy for\never?”\n\n“No, I can’t admit it. Brother,” said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing\neyes, “you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would\nhave the right to forgive and could forgive? But there is a Being and\nHe can forgive everything, all and for all, because He gave His\ninnocent blood for all and everything. You have forgotten Him, and on\nHim is built the edifice, and it is to Him they cry aloud, ‘Thou art\njust, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!’ ”\n\n“Ah! the One without sin and His blood! No, I have not forgotten Him;\non the contrary I’ve been wondering all the time how it was you did not\nbring Him in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him in\nthe foreground. Do you know, Alyosha—don’t laugh! I made a poem about a\nyear ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I’ll tell it to\nyou.”\n\n“You wrote a poem?”\n\n“Oh, no, I didn’t write it,” laughed Ivan, “and I’ve never written two\nlines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I\nremembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my\nfirst reader—that is listener. Why should an author forego even one\nlistener?” smiled Ivan. “Shall I tell it to you?”\n\n“I am all attention,” said Alyosha.\n\n“My poem is called ‘The Grand Inquisitor’; it’s a ridiculous thing, but\nI want to tell it to you.”"

            "0": "“Even this must have a preface—that is, a literary preface,” laughed\nIvan, “and I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes\nplace in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably\nlearnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly\npowers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as\nthe monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in\nwhich the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were\nbrought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In\nVictor Hugo’s _Notre Dame de Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous\nspectacle was provided for the people in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in\nthe reign of Louis XI. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was\ncalled _Le bon jugement de la très sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie_,\nand she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her _bon jugement_.\nSimilar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally\nperformed in Moscow too, up to the times of Peter the Great. But\nbesides plays there were all sorts of legends and ballads scattered\nabout the world, in which the saints and angels and all the powers of\nHeaven took part when required. In our monasteries the monks busied\nthemselves in translating, copying, and even composing such poems—and\neven under the Tatars. There is, for instance, one such poem (of\ncourse, from the Greek), _The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell_,\nwith descriptions as bold as Dante’s. Our Lady visits hell, and the\nArchangel Michael leads her through the torments. She sees the sinners\nand their punishment. There she sees among others one noteworthy set of\nsinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake\nso that they can’t swim out, and ‘these God forgets’—an expression of\nextraordinary depth and force. And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping,\nfalls before the throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell—for\nall she has seen there, indiscriminately. Her conversation with God is\nimmensely interesting. She beseeches Him, she will not desist, and when\nGod points to the hands and feet of her Son, nailed to the Cross, and\nasks, ‘How can I forgive His tormentors?’ she bids all the saints, all\nthe martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down with her and\npray for mercy on all without distinction. It ends by her winning from\nGod a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity\nDay, and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell,\nchanting, ‘Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.’ Well, my poem\nwould have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. He comes\non the scene in my poem, but He says nothing, only appears and passes\non. Fifteen centuries have passed since He promised to come in His\nglory, fifteen centuries since His prophet wrote, ‘Behold, I come\nquickly’; ‘Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son,\nbut the Father,’ as He Himself predicted on earth. But humanity awaits\nhim with the same faith and with the same love. Oh, with greater faith,\nfor it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from\nheaven.",
            "1": "No signs from heaven come to‐day\nTo add to what the heart doth say.\n\n\nThere was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true\nthere were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed\nmiraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies,\nwere visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not\nslumber, and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of\nthese miracles. And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a\nterrible new heresy. “A huge star like to a torch” (that is, to a\nchurch) “fell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter.”\nThese heretics began blasphemously denying miracles. But those who\nremained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith. The tears of\nhumanity rose up to Him as before, awaited His coming, loved Him, hoped\nfor Him, yearned to suffer and die for Him as before. And so many ages\nmankind had prayed with faith and fervor, “O Lord our God, hasten Thy\ncoming,” so many ages called upon Him, that in His infinite mercy He\ndeigned to come down to His servants. Before that day He had come down,\nHe had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as is written in\ntheir lives. Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the truth of\nhis words, bore witness that\n\nBearing the Cross, in slavish dress,\nWeary and worn, the Heavenly King\nOur mother, Russia, came to bless,\nAnd through our land went wandering.\n\n\nAnd that certainly was so, I assure you.",
            "2": "“And behold, He deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the\ntortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him like\nchildren. My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible\ntime of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory\nof God, and ‘in the splendid _auto da fé_ the wicked heretics were\nburnt.’ Oh, of course, this was not the coming in which He will appear\naccording to His promise at the end of time in all His heavenly glory,\nand which will be sudden ‘as lightning flashing from east to west.’ No,\nHe visited His children only for a moment, and there where the flames\nwere crackling round the heretics. In His infinite mercy He came once\nmore among men in that human shape in which He walked among men for\nthree years fifteen centuries ago. He came down to the ‘hot pavements’\nof the southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred\nheretics had, _ad majorem gloriam Dei_, been burnt by the cardinal, the\nGrand Inquisitor, in a magnificent _auto da fé_, in the presence of the\nking, the court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies\nof the court, and the whole population of Seville.",
            "3": "“He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one\nrecognized Him. That might be one of the best passages in the poem. I\nmean, why they recognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to\nHim, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves\nsilently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The\nsun of love burns in His heart, light and power shine from His eyes,\nand their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with\nresponsive love. He holds out His hands to them, blesses them, and a\nhealing virtue comes from contact with Him, even with His garments. An\nold man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, ‘O Lord, heal me\nand I shall see Thee!’ and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and\nthe blind man sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His\nfeet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. ‘It is\nHe—it is He!’ all repeat. ‘It must be He, it can be no one but Him!’ He\nstops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the\nweeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies\na child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead\nchild lies hidden in flowers. ‘He will raise your child,’ the crowd\nshouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin,\nlooks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws\nherself at His feet with a wail. ‘If it is Thou, raise my child!’ she\ncries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin\nis laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His\nlips once more softly pronounce, ‘Maiden, arise!’ and the maiden\narises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling\nwith wide‐ open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had\nput in her hand.",
            "4": "“There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment\nthe cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He\nis an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and\nsunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not\ndressed in his gorgeous cardinal’s robes, as he was the day before,\nwhen he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church—at this moment he\nis wearing his coarse, old, monk’s cassock. At a distance behind him\ncome his gloomy assistants and slaves and the ‘holy guard.’ He stops at\nthe sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He sees\neverything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the\nchild rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and\nhis eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids\nthe guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the\npeople cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the\ncrowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of\ndeathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd\ninstantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old\nInquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards\nlead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient\npalace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and\nis followed by the dark, burning, ‘breathless’ night of Seville. The\nair is ‘fragrant with laurel and lemon.’ In the pitch darkness the iron\ndoor of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself\ncomes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at\nonce behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes\ninto His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table\nand speaks.",
            "5": "“ ‘Is it Thou? Thou?’ but receiving no answer, he adds at once, ‘Don’t\nanswer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what\nThou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou\nhadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast\ncome to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will\nbe to‐ morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it\nis Thou or only a semblance of Him, but to‐morrow I shall condemn Thee\nand burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very\npeople who have to‐day kissed Thy feet, to‐morrow at the faintest sign\nfrom me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that?\nYes, maybe Thou knowest it,’ he added with thoughtful penetration,\nnever for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.”\n\n“I don’t quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean?” Alyosha, who had\nbeen listening in silence, said with a smile. “Is it simply a wild\nfantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man—some impossible\n_quiproquo_?”\n\n“Take it as the last,” said Ivan, laughing, “if you are so corrupted by\nmodern realism and can’t stand anything fantastic. If you like it to be\na case of mistaken identity, let it be so. It is true,” he went on,\nlaughing, “the old man was ninety, and he might well be crazy over his\nset idea. He might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner.\nIt might, in fact, be simply his ravings, the delusion of an old man of\nninety, over‐excited by the _auto da fé_ of a hundred heretics the day\nbefore. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of\nidentity or a wild fantasy? All that matters is that the old man should\nspeak out, should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for\nninety years.”\n\n“And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He look at him and not say a\nword?”",
            "6": "“That’s inevitable in any case,” Ivan laughed again. “The old man has\ntold Him He hasn’t the right to add anything to what He has said of\nold. One may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman\nCatholicism, in my opinion at least. ‘All has been given by Thee to the\nPope,’ they say, ‘and all, therefore, is still in the Pope’s hands, and\nthere is no need for Thee to come now at all. Thou must not meddle for\nthe time, at least.’ That’s how they speak and write too—the Jesuits,\nat any rate. I have read it myself in the works of their theologians.\n‘Hast Thou the right to reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world\nfrom which Thou hast come?’ my old man asks Him, and answers the\nquestion for Him. ‘No, Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what\nhas been said of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which\nThou didst exalt when Thou wast on earth. Whatsoever Thou revealest\nanew will encroach on men’s freedom of faith; for it will be manifest\nas a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than\nanything in those days fifteen hundred years ago. Didst Thou not often\nsay then, “I will make you free”? But now Thou hast seen these “free”\nmen,’ the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile. ‘Yes, we’ve paid\ndearly for it,’ he goes on, looking sternly at Him, ‘but at last we\nhave completed that work in Thy name. For fifteen centuries we have\nbeen wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and over for good.\nDost Thou not believe that it’s over for good? Thou lookest meekly at\nme and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But let me tell Thee that\nnow, to‐day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect\nfreedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly\nat our feet. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst? Was\nthis Thy freedom?’ ”\n\n“I don’t understand again,” Alyosha broke in. “Is he ironical, is he\njesting?”",
            "7": "“Not a bit of it! He claims it as a merit for himself and his Church\nthat at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men\nhappy. ‘For now’ (he is speaking of the Inquisition, of course) ‘for\nthe first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men.\nMan was created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast\nwarned,’ he says to Him. ‘Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and\nwarnings, but Thou didst not listen to those warnings; Thou didst\nreject the only way by which men might be made happy. But, fortunately,\ndeparting Thou didst hand on the work to us. Thou hast promised, Thou\nhast established by Thy word, Thou hast given to us the right to bind\nand to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it\naway. Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?’ ”\n\n“And what’s the meaning of ‘no lack of admonitions and warnings’?”\nasked Alyosha.\n\n“Why, that’s the chief part of what the old man must say.",
            "8": "“ ‘The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self‐destruction and non‐\nexistence,’ the old man goes on, ‘the great spirit talked with Thee in\nthe wilderness, and we are told in the books that he “tempted” Thee. Is\nthat so? And could anything truer be said than what he revealed to Thee\nin three questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is\ncalled “the temptation”? And yet if there has ever been on earth a real\nstupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three\ntemptations. The statement of those three questions was itself the\nmiracle. If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument\nthat those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly\nfrom the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them\nanew, and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the\nearth—rulers, chief priests, learned men, philosophers, poets—and had\nset them the task to invent three questions, such as would not only fit\nthe occasion, but express in three words, three human phrases, the\nwhole future history of the world and of humanity—dost Thou believe\nthat all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in\ndepth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to\nThee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? From those\nquestions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can see that\nwe have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence, but with\nthe absolute and eternal. For in those three questions the whole\nsubsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together into one\nwhole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved historical\ncontradictions of human nature. At the time it could not be so clear,\nsince the future was unknown; but now that fifteen hundred years have\npassed, we see that everything in those three questions was so justly\ndivined and foretold, and has been so truly fulfilled, that nothing can\nbe added to them or taken from them.",
            "9": "“ ‘Judge Thyself who was right—Thou or he who questioned Thee then?\nRemember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this:\n“Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with\nsome promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural\nunruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread—for\nnothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society\nthan freedom. But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren\nwilderness? Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like\na flock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling,\nlest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.” But Thou wouldst\nnot deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what\nis that freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread? Thou didst\nreply that man lives not by bread alone. But dost Thou know that for\nthe sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up\nagainst Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will\nfollow him, crying, “Who can compare with this beast? He has given us\nfire from heaven!” Dost Thou know that the ages will pass, and humanity\nwill proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime, and\ntherefore no sin; there is only hunger? “Feed men, and then ask of them\nvirtue!” that’s what they’ll write on the banner, which they will raise\nagainst Thee, and with which they will destroy Thy temple. Where Thy\ntemple stood will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will\nbe built again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be\nfinished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut\nshort the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come\nback to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower. They will\nseek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall be\nagain persecuted and tortured. They will find us and cry to us, “Feed\nus, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven’t given it!”\nAnd then we shall finish building their tower, for he finishes the\nbuilding who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name,\ndeclaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never, never can they\nfeed themselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as\nthey remain free. In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet,\nand say to us, “Make us your slaves, but feed us.” They will understand\nthemselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are\ninconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share\nbetween them! They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free,\nfor they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. Thou didst\npromise them the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare\nwith earthly bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble\nrace of man? And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall\nfollow Thee, what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of\nmillions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the\nearthly bread for the sake of the heavenly? Or dost Thou care only for\nthe tens of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions,\nnumerous as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must\nexist only for the sake of the great and strong? No, we care for the\nweak too. They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will\nbecome obedient. They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because\nwe are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful\nand to rule over them—so awful it will seem to them to be free. But we\nshall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name. We\nshall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us again.\nThat deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to lie.",
            "10": "“ ‘This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness,\nand this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which\nThou hast exalted above everything. Yet in this question lies hid the\ngreat secret of this world. Choosing “bread,” Thou wouldst have\nsatisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity—to find\nsome one to worship. So long as man remains free he strives for nothing\nso incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to worship. But man\nseeks to worship what is established beyond dispute, so that all men\nwould agree at once to worship it. For these pitiful creatures are\nconcerned not only to find what one or the other can worship, but to\nfind something that all would believe in and worship; what is essential\nis that all may be _together_ in it. This craving for _community_ of\nworship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all\nhumanity from the beginning of time. For the sake of common worship\nthey’ve slain each other with the sword. They have set up gods and\nchallenged one another, “Put away your gods and come and worship ours,\nor we will kill you and your gods!” And so it will be to the end of the\nworld, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down\nbefore idols just the same. Thou didst know, Thou couldst not but have\nknown, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject\nthe one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow\ndown to Thee alone—the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected\nit for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven. Behold what Thou\ndidst further. And all again in the name of freedom! I tell Thee that\nman is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to\nwhom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill‐fated\ncreature is born. But only one who can appease their conscience can\ntake over their freedom. In bread there was offered Thee an invincible\nbanner; give bread, and man will worship thee, for nothing is more\ncertain than bread. But if some one else gains possession of his\nconscience—oh! then he will cast away Thy bread and follow after him\nwho has ensnared his conscience. In that Thou wast right. For the\nsecret of man’s being is not only to live but to have something to live\nfor. Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not\nconsent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain\non earth, though he had bread in abundance. That is true. But what\nhappened? Instead of taking men’s freedom from them, Thou didst make it\ngreater than ever! Didst Thou forget that man prefers peace, and even\ndeath, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil? Nothing\nis more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing\nis a greater cause of suffering. And behold, instead of giving a firm\nfoundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever, Thou\ndidst choose all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic; Thou didst\nchoose what was utterly beyond the strength of men, acting as though\nThou didst not love them at all—Thou who didst come to give Thy life\nfor them! Instead of taking possession of men’s freedom, Thou didst\nincrease it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its\nsufferings for ever. Thou didst desire man’s free love, that he should\nfollow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee. In place of the\nrigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for\nhimself what is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him\nas his guide. But didst Thou not know that he would at last reject even\nThy image and Thy truth, if he is weighed down with the fearful burden\nof free choice? They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in\nThee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion and\nsuffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many cares and\nunanswerable problems.",
            "11": "“ ‘So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the\ndestruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it. Yet\nwhat was offered Thee? There are three powers, three powers alone, able\nto conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these\nimpotent rebels for their happiness—those forces are miracle, mystery\nand authority. Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example\nfor doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle\nof the temple and said to Thee, “If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art\nthe Son of God then cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels\nshall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know\nthen whether Thou art the Son of God and shalt prove then how great is\nThy faith in Thy Father.” But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast\nThyself down. Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God; but\nthe weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? Oh, Thou didst know then\nthat in taking one step, in making one movement to cast Thyself down,\nThou wouldst be tempting God and have lost all Thy faith in Him, and\nwouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which Thou didst\ncome to save. And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would have\nrejoiced. But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And couldst Thou\nbelieve for one moment that men, too, could face such a temptation? Is\nthe nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great\nmoments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing\nspiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?\nOh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, would be\nhanded down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and Thou\ndidst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for\na miracle. But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he\nrejects God too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous. And\nas man cannot bear to be without the miraculous, he will create new\nmiracles of his own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and\nwitchcraft, though he might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic\nand infidel. Thou didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted\nto Thee, mocking and reviling Thee, “Come down from the cross and we\nwill believe that Thou art He.” Thou didst not come down, for again\nThou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith given\nfreely, not based on miracle. Thou didst crave for free love and not\nthe base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him\nfor ever. But Thou didst think too highly of men therein, for they are\nslaves, of course, though rebellious by nature. Look round and judge;\nfifteen centuries have passed, look upon them. Whom hast Thou raised up\nto Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast\nbelieved him! Can he, can he do what Thou didst? By showing him so much\nrespect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him, for Thou didst\nask far too much from him—Thou who hast loved him more than Thyself!\nRespecting him less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him. That would\nhave been more like love, for his burden would have been lighter. He is\nweak and vile. What though he is everywhere now rebelling against our\npower, and proud of his rebellion? It is the pride of a child and a\nschoolboy. They are little children rioting and barring out the teacher\nat school. But their childish delight will end; it will cost them dear.\nThey will cast down temples and drench the earth with blood. But they\nwill see at last, the foolish children, that, though they are rebels,\nthey are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their own rebellion. Bathed\nin their foolish tears, they will recognize at last that He who created\nthem rebels must have meant to mock at them. They will say this in\ndespair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them\nmore unhappy still, for man’s nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in the\nend always avenges it on itself. And so unrest, confusion and\nunhappiness—that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so\nmuch for their freedom! The great prophet tells in vision and in image,\nthat he saw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that\nthere were of each tribe twelve thousand. But if there were so many of\nthem, they must have been not men but gods. They had borne Thy cross,\nthey had endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness,\nliving upon locusts and roots—and Thou mayest indeed point with pride\nat those children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid\nsacrifice for Thy name. But remember that they were only some\nthousands; and what of the rest? And how are the other weak ones to\nblame, because they could not endure what the strong have endured? How\nis the weak soul to blame that it is unable to receive such terrible\ngifts? Canst Thou have simply come to the elect and for the elect? But\nif so, it is a mystery and we cannot understand it. And if it is a\nmystery, we too have a right to preach a mystery, and to teach them\nthat it’s not the free judgment of their hearts, not love that matters,\nbut a mystery which they must follow blindly, even against their\nconscience. So we have done. We have corrected Thy work and have\nfounded it upon _miracle_, _mystery_ and _authority_. And men rejoiced\nthat they were again led like sheep, and that the terrible gift that\nhad brought them such suffering was, at last, lifted from their hearts.\nWere we right teaching them this? Speak! Did we not love mankind, so\nmeekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly lightening their\nburden, and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction?\nWhy hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look silently\nand searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes? Be angry. I don’t want Thy\nlove, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anything\nfrom Thee? Don’t I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is\nknown to Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our\nmystery? Perhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then.\nWe are not working with Thee, but with _him_—that is our mystery. It’s\nlong—eight centuries—since we have been on _his_ side and not on Thine.\nJust eight centuries ago, we took from him what Thou didst reject with\nscorn, that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of\nthe earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Cæsar, and proclaimed\nourselves sole rulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been\nable to complete our work. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is\nonly beginning, but it has begun. It has long to await completion and\nthe earth has yet much to suffer, but we shall triumph and shall be\nCæsars, and then we shall plan the universal happiness of man. But Thou\nmightest have taken even then the sword of Cæsar. Why didst Thou reject\nthat last gift? Hadst Thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty\nspirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished all that man seeks on earth—that\nis, some one to worship, some one to keep his conscience, and some\nmeans of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious ant‐heap, for the\ncraving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men.\nMankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state.\nThere have been many great nations with great histories, but the more\nhighly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they felt\nmore acutely than other people the craving for world‐wide union. The\ngreat conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis‐Khans, whirled like hurricanes\nover the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they too\nwere but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal\nunity. Hadst Thou taken the world and Cæsar’s purple, Thou wouldst have\nfounded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who can\nrule men if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his\nhands? We have taken the sword of Cæsar, and in taking it, of course,\nhave rejected Thee and followed _him_. Oh, ages are yet to come of the\nconfusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism. For having\nbegun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of\ncourse, with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick\nour feet and spatter them with tears of blood. And we shall sit upon\nthe beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, “Mystery.” But\nthen, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come for\nmen. Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while\nwe give rest to all. And besides, how many of those elect, those mighty\nones who could become elect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and\nhave transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and the\nwarmth of their heart to the other camp, and end by raising their\n_free_ banner against Thee. Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner. But\nwith us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one\nanother as under Thy freedom. Oh, we shall persuade them that they will\nonly become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to\nus. And shall we be right or shall we be lying? They will be convinced\nthat we are right, for they will remember the horrors of slavery and\nconfusion to which Thy freedom brought them. Freedom, free thought and\nscience, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to\nface with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of them, the\nfierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious but\nweak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will\ncrawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: “Yes, you were right, you\nalone possess His mystery, and we come back to you, save us from\nourselves!”",
            "12": "“ ‘Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the\nbread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any\nmiracle. They will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but\nin truth they will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than\nfor the bread itself! For they will remember only too well that in old\ndays, without our help, even the bread they made turned to stones in\ntheir hands, while since they have come back to us, the very stones\nhave turned to bread in their hands. Too, too well will they know the\nvalue of complete submission! And until men know that, they will be\nunhappy. Who is most to blame for their not knowing it?—speak! Who\nscattered the flock and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock\nwill come together again and will submit once more, and then it will be\nonce for all. Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of\nweak creatures such as they are by nature. Oh, we shall persuade them\nat last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and thereby taught\nthem to be proud. We shall show them that they are weak, that they are\nonly pitiful children, but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of\nall. They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us\nin fear, as chicks to the hen. They will marvel at us and will be\nawe‐stricken before us, and will be proud at our being so powerful and\nclever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of\nthousands of millions. They will tremble impotently before our wrath,\ntheir minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like\nwomen and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to\npass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song. Yes,\nwe shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make\ntheir life like a child’s game, with children’s songs and innocent\ndance. Oh, we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless,\nand they will love us like children because we allow them to sin. We\nshall tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our\npermission, that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the\npunishment for these sins we take upon ourselves. And we shall take it\nupon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors who have taken\non themselves their sins before God. And they will have no secrets from\nus. We shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and\nmistresses, to have or not to have children—according to whether they\nhave been obedient or disobedient—and they will submit to us gladly and\ncheerfully. The most painful secrets of their conscience, all, all they\nwill bring to us, and we shall have an answer for all. And they will be\nglad to believe our answer, for it will save them from the great\nanxiety and terrible agony they endure at present in making a free\ndecision for themselves. And all will be happy, all the millions of\ncreatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For only we,\nwe who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy. There will be thousands of\nmillions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who have\ntaken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.\nPeacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and\nbeyond the grave they will find nothing but death. But we shall keep\nthe secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the\nreward of heaven and eternity. Though if there were anything in the\nother world, it certainly would not be for such as they. It is\nprophesied that Thou wilt come again in victory, Thou wilt come with\nThy chosen, the proud and strong, but we will say that they have only\nsaved themselves, but we have saved all. We are told that the harlot\nwho sits upon the beast, and holds in her hands the _mystery_, shall be\nput to shame, that the weak will rise up again, and will rend her royal\npurple and will strip naked her loathsome body. But then I will stand\nup and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy children who\nhave known no sin. And we who have taken their sins upon us for their\nhappiness will stand up before Thee and say: “Judge us if Thou canst\nand darest.” Know that I fear Thee not. Know that I too have been in\nthe wilderness, I too have lived on roots and locusts, I too prized the\nfreedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and I too was striving to\nstand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful, thirsting “to\nmake up the number.” But I awakened and would not serve madness. I\nturned back and joined the ranks of those _who have corrected Thy\nwork_. I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness\nof the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion\nwill be built up. I repeat, to‐morrow Thou shalt see that obedient\nflock who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders\nabout the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us.

            "13": "Ivan stopped. He was carried away as he talked, and spoke with\nexcitement; when he had finished, he suddenly smiled.\n\nAlyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he was greatly moved\nand seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained\nhimself. Now his words came with a rush.\n\n“But ... that’s absurd!” he cried, flushing. “Your poem is in praise of\nJesus, not in blame of Him—as you meant it to be. And who will believe\nyou about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That’s not the\nidea of it in the Orthodox Church.... That’s Rome, and not even the\nwhole of Rome, it’s false—those are the worst of the Catholics, the\nInquisitors, the Jesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic\ncreature as your Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take\non themselves? Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some\ncurse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind? When have they been\nseen? We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are\nnot what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They\nare simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in\nthe future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that’s their\nideal, but there’s no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it....\nIt’s simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of\ndomination—something like a universal serfdom with them as\nmasters—that’s all they stand for. They don’t even believe in God\nperhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.”\n\n“Stay, stay,” laughed Ivan, “how hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it\nbe so! Of course it’s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really\nthink that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is\nactually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain? Is that\nFather Païssy’s teaching?”\n\n“No, no, on the contrary, Father Païssy did once say something rather\nthe same as you ... but of course it’s not the same, not a bit the\nsame,” Alyosha hastily corrected himself.",
            "14": "“A precious admission, in spite of your ‘not a bit the same.’ I ask you\nwhy your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material\ngain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great\nsorrow and loving humanity? You see, only suppose that there was one\nsuch man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain—if\nthere’s only one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in\nthe desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make\nhimself free and perfect. But yet all his life he loved humanity, and\nsuddenly his eyes were opened, and he saw that it is no great moral\nblessedness to attain perfection and freedom, if at the same time one\ngains the conviction that millions of God’s creatures have been created\nas a mockery, that they will never be capable of using their freedom,\nthat these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the\ntower, that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt\nhis dream of harmony. Seeing all that he turned back and joined—the\nclever people. Surely that could have happened?”\n\n“Joined whom, what clever people?” cried Alyosha, completely carried\naway. “They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and\nsecrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that’s all their secret. Your\nInquisitor does not believe in God, that’s his secret!”",
            "15": "“What if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It’s perfectly true,\nit’s true that that’s the whole secret, but isn’t that suffering, at\nleast for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert\nand yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old\nage he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the\ngreat dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the\nfeeble, unruly, ‘incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.’ And\nso, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the\nwise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore\naccept lying and deception, and lead men consciously to death and\ndestruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not\nnotice where they are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at\nleast on the way think themselves happy. And note, the deception is in\nthe name of Him in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed\nall his life long. Is not that tragic? And if only one such stood at\nthe head of the whole army ‘filled with the lust of power only for the\nsake of filthy gain’—would not one such be enough to make a tragedy?\nMore than that, one such standing at the head is enough to create the\nactual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its armies and\nJesuits, its highest idea. I tell you frankly that I firmly believe\nthat there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head\nof the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such even among\nthe Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man\nwho loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found even\nnow in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by\nagreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the\nmystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them\nhappy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even\namong the Masons there’s something of the same mystery at the bottom,\nand that that’s why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals\nbreaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there\nshould be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my\nidea I might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.”",

When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he\nwaited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed\ndown upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the\ntime, looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply.\nThe old man longed for Him to say something, however bitter and\nterrible. But He suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly\nkissed him on his bloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old\nman shuddered. His lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said\nto Him: ‘Go, and come no more ... come not at all, never, never!’ And\nhe let Him out into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went\naway.”\n\n“And the old man?”\n\n“The kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.”\n\n“And you with him, you too?” cried Alyosha, mournfully.\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n“Why, it’s all nonsense, Alyosha. It’s only a senseless poem of a\nsenseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do you\ntake it so seriously? Surely you don’t suppose I am going straight off\nto the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord,\nit’s no business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to\nthirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!”\n\n“But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue\nsky, and the woman you love!

No, that’s just what you are going away for, to\njoin them ... if not, you will kill yourself, you can’t endure it!”\n\n“There is a strength to endure everything,” Ivan said with a cold\nsmile.\n\n“What strength?”\n\n“The strength of the Karamazovs—the strength of the Karamazov\nbaseness.”\n\n“To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?”\n\n“Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape\nit, and then—”\n\n“How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That’s impossible\nwith your ideas.”\n\n“In the Karamazov way, again.”\n\n“ ‘Everything is lawful,’ you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?”\n\nIvan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.",

I won’t deny it. And Mitya’s version isn’t bad.”\n\nAlyosha looked at him in silence.\n\n“I thought that going away from here I have you at least,” Ivan said\nsuddenly, with unexpected feeling; “but now I see that there is no\nplace for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, ‘all is\nlawful,’ I won’t renounce—will you renounce me for that, yes?”\n\nAlyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips.\n\n“That’s plagiarism,” cried Ivan, highly delighted. “You stole that from\nmy poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it’s time we were going,\nboth of us.”\n\nThey went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the\nrestaurant.\n\n“Listen, Alyosha,” Ivan began in a resolute voice, “if I am really able\nto care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them,\nremembering you. It’s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I\nshan’t lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as\na declaration of love if you like.

I mean even if I don’t\ngo away to‐morrow (I think I certainly shall go) and we meet again,\ndon’t say a word more on these subjects. I beg that particularly. And\nabout Dmitri too, I ask you specially, never speak to me again,” he\nadded, with sudden irritation; “it’s all exhausted, it has all been\nsaid over and over again, hasn’t it? And I’ll make you one promise in\nreturn for it. When at thirty, I want to ‘dash the cup to the ground,’\nwherever I may be I’ll come to have one more talk with you, even though\nit were from America, you may be sure of that. I’ll come on purpose. It\nwill be very interesting to have a look at you, to see what you’ll be\nby that time. It’s rather a solemn promise, you see. And we really may\nbe parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your Pater\nSeraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry with\nme for having kept you. Good‐by, kiss me once more; that’s right, now\ngo.”",
            "18": "Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just\nas Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been\nvery different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through\nAlyosha’s mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited\na little, looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan\nswayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his\nleft. He had never noticed it before. But all at once he turned too,\nand almost ran to the monastery. It was nearly dark, and he felt almost\nfrightened; something new was growing up in him for which he could not\naccount. The wind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the\nancient pines murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage\ncopse. He almost ran. “Pater Seraphicus—he got that name from\nsomewhere—where from?” Alyosha wondered. “Ivan, poor Ivan, and when\nshall I see you again?... Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he is,\nPater Seraphicus, he will save me—from him and for ever!”\n\nSeveral times afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving Ivan so\ncompletely forget his brother Dmitri, though he had that morning, only\na few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up\ndoing so, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that\nnight."

            "0": "And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\nhouse. But, strange to say, he was overcome by insufferable depression,\nwhich grew greater at every step he took towards the house. There was\nnothing strange in his being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan\ncould not have said what was the cause of it. He had often been\ndepressed before, and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at\nsuch a moment, when he had broken off with everything that had brought\nhim here, and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon\na new, unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and\nthough he had great hopes, and great—too great—expectations from life,\nhe could not have given any definite account of his hopes, his\nexpectations, or even his desires.\n\nYet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown\ncertainly found place in his heart, what was worrying him was something\nquite different. “Is it loathing for my father’s house?” he wondered.\n“Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it’s the last time I\nshall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it.... No, it’s not\nthat either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had\nwith him? For so many years I’ve been silent with the whole world and\nnot deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like\nthat.” It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful\ninexperience and vanity—vexation at having failed to express himself,\nespecially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had\ncertainly been reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must\nhave done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. “I\nfeel sick with depression and yet I can’t tell what I want. Better not\nthink, perhaps.”\n\nIvan tried “not to think,” but that, too, was no use. What made his\ndepression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of\ncasual, external character—he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to\nbe standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude\nitself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or\nconversation that for a long time one does not notice it, yet it\nirritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes, and\nremoves the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous\none—some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief on the\nfloor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on.",
            "1": "At last, feeling very cross and ill‐humored, Ivan arrived home, and\nsuddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was\nfretting and worrying him.\n\nOn a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the\ncoolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that\nthe valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and that it was this man that his\nsoul loathed. It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear. Just\nbefore, when Alyosha had been telling him of his meeting with\nSmerdyakov, he had felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which\nhad immediately stirred responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as\nhe talked, Smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time; but still he had\nbeen in his mind, and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was\nwalking home, the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again.\n“Is it possible that a miserable, contemptible creature like that can\nworry me so much?” he wondered, with insufferable irritation.",
            "2": "It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for\nthe man, especially during the last few days. He had even begun to\nnotice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the\ncreature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when\nIvan first came to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently. Then\nhe had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him\nvery original. He had encouraged him to talk to him, although he had\nalways wondered at a certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in\nhis mind, and could not understand what it was that so continually and\ninsistently worked upon the brain of “the contemplative.” They\ndiscussed philosophical questions and even how there could have been\nlight on the first day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created\non the fourth day, and how that was to be understood. But Ivan soon saw\nthat, though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject,\nyet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he was looking\nfor something altogether different. In one way and another, he began to\nbetray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and that Ivan\ndisliked. It had first given rise to his aversion. Later on, there had\nbeen trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and there\nhad been the scandals with his brother Dmitri—they discussed that, too.\nBut though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it\nwas impossible to discover what he desired to come of it. There was, in\nfact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some\nof his desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.\nSmerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously\npremeditated questions, but what his object was he did not explain, and\nusually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse\ninto silence or pass to another subject. But what finally irritated\nIvan most and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar, revolting\nfamiliarity which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly. Not\nthat he forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he always spoke\nvery respectfully, yet he had obviously begun to consider—goodness\nknows why!—that there was some sort of understanding between him and\nIvan Fyodorovitch. He always spoke in a tone that suggested that those\ntwo had some kind of compact, some secret between them, that had at\nsome time been expressed on both sides, only known to them and beyond\nthe comprehension of those around them. But for a long while Ivan did\nnot recognize the real cause of his growing dislike and he had only\nlately realized what was at the root of it.",
            "3": "With a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the\ngate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov. But Smerdyakov rose\nfrom the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he\nwanted particularly to talk to him. Ivan looked at him and stopped, and\nthe fact that he did stop, instead of passing by, as he meant to the\nminute before, drove him to fury. With anger and repulsion he looked at\nSmerdyakov’s emasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed\nforward on his forehead. His left eye winked and he grinned as if to\nsay, “Where are you going? You won’t pass by; you see that we two\nclever people have something to say to each other.”\n\nIvan shook. “Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you?”\nwas on the tip of his tongue, but to his profound astonishment he heard\nhimself say, “Is my father still asleep, or has he waked?”\n\nHe asked the question softly and meekly, to his own surprise, and at\nonce, again to his own surprise, sat down on the bench. For an instant\nhe felt almost frightened; he remembered it afterwards. Smerdyakov\nstood facing him, his hands behind his back, looking at him with\nassurance and almost severity.\n\n“His honor is still asleep,” he articulated deliberately (“You were the\nfirst to speak, not I,” he seemed to say). “I am surprised at you,\nsir,” he added, after a pause, dropping his eyes affectedly, setting\nhis right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his polished boot.\n\n“Why are you surprised at me?” Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing\nhis utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust,\nthat he was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account,\nhave gone away without satisfying it.\n\n“Why don’t you go to Tchermashnya, sir?” Smerdyakov suddenly raised his\neyes and smiled familiarly. “Why I smile you must understand of\nyourself, if you are a clever man,” his screwed‐up left eye seemed to\nsay.\n\n“Why should I go to Tchermashnya?” Ivan asked in surprise.\n\nSmerdyakov was silent again.\n\n“Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,” he said at last,\nslowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer. “I put\nyou off with a secondary reason,” he seemed to suggest, “simply to say\nsomething.”\n\n“Damn you! Speak out what you want!” Ivan cried angrily at last,\npassing from meekness to violence.\n\nSmerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but\nstill looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.",
            "4": "“Substantially nothing—but just by way of conversation.”\n\nAnother silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan\nknew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood\nbefore him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would\nbe angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get\nup. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment.\n\n“I’m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don’t know how to help\nmyself,” he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he\nsighed. Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again.\n\n“They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,”\nSmerdyakov went on. “I am speaking of your parent and your brother\nDmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and\nbegin worrying me every minute, ‘Has she come? Why hasn’t she come?’\nand so on up till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena\nAlexandrovna doesn’t come (for very likely she does not mean to come at\nall) then he will be at me again to‐morrow morning, ‘Why hasn’t she\ncome? When will she come?’—as though I were to blame for it. On the\nother side it’s no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before,\nyour brother will appear with his gun in his hands: ‘Look out, you\nrogue, you soup‐maker. If you miss her and don’t let me know she’s\nbeen—I’ll kill you before any one.’ When the night’s over, in the\nmorning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death.\n‘Why hasn’t she come? Will she come soon?’ And he, too, thinks me to\nblame because his lady hasn’t come. And every day and every hour they\nget angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall kill myself\nin a fright. I can’t depend upon them, sir.”\n\n“And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri\nFyodorovitch?” said Ivan irritably.\n\n“How could I help meddling? Though, indeed, I haven’t meddled at all,\nif you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very\nbeginning, not daring to answer; but he pitched on me to be his\nservant. He has had only one thing to say since: ‘I’ll kill you, you\nscoundrel, if you miss her,’ I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a\nlong fit to‐ morrow.”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘a long fit’?”",
            "5": "“A long fit, lasting a long time—several hours, or perhaps a day or\ntwo. Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time.\nThe struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I\ncouldn’t come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for\nHerzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head and tried\nanother remedy, too.... I might have died.”\n\n“But they say one can’t tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What\nmakes you say you will have one to‐morrow?” Ivan inquired, with a\npeculiar, irritable curiosity.\n\n“That’s just so. You can’t tell beforehand.”\n\n“Besides, you fell from the garret then.”\n\n“I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again\nto‐morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps. I have to\ngo into the cellar every day, too.”\n\nIvan took a long look at him.\n\n“You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don’t quite understand you,” he\nsaid softly, but with a sort of menace. “Do you mean to pretend to be\nill to‐morrow for three days, eh?”\n\nSmerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the\ntoe of his right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward,\nand, grinning, articulated:\n\n“If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a\nfit—and it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them—I should\nhave a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death. For\neven if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his father while I am ill,\nhis honor can’t blame a sick man for not telling him. He’d be ashamed\nto.”\n\n“Hang it all!” Ivan cried, his face working with anger, “why are you\nalways in such a funk for your life? All my brother Dmitri’s threats\nare only hasty words and mean nothing. He won’t kill you; it’s not you\nhe’ll kill!”\n\n“He’d kill me first of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am\nafraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something\ncrazy to his father.”\n\n“Why should you be taken for an accomplice?”\n\n“They’ll think I am an accomplice, because I let him know the signals\nas a great secret.”\n\n“What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.”",
            "6": "“I’m bound to admit the fact,” Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic\ncomposure, “that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this\nbusiness. As you know yourself (if only you do know it) he has for\nseveral days past locked himself in as soon as night or even evening\ncomes on. Of late you’ve been going upstairs to your room early every\nevening, and yesterday you did not come down at all, and so perhaps you\ndon’t know how carefully he has begun to lock himself in at night, and\neven if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the door he won’t open to him\ntill he hears his voice. But Grigory Vassilyevitch does not come,\nbecause I wait upon him alone in his room now. That’s the arrangement\nhe made himself ever since this to‐do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began.\nBut at night, by his orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don’t get\nto sleep till midnight, but am on the watch, getting up and walking\nabout the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come. For the last\nfew days he’s been perfectly frantic expecting her. What he argues is,\nshe is afraid of him, Dmitri Fyodorovitch (Mitya, as he calls him),\n‘and so,’ says he, ‘she’ll come the back‐way, late at night, to me. You\nlook out for her,’ says he, ‘till midnight and later; and if she does\ncome, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the garden.\nKnock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more quickly,\nthen,’ says he, ‘I shall understand at once that she has come, and will\nopen the door to you quietly.’ Another signal he gave me in case\nanything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an\ninterval, another much louder. Then he will understand that something\nhas happened suddenly and that I must see him, and he will open to me\nso that I can go and speak to him. That’s all in case Agrafena\nAlexandrovna can’t come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch might come, too, so I must let him know he is near. His\nhonor is awfully afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if\nAgrafena Alexandrovna had come and were locked in with him, and Dmitri\nFyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be\nbound to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that the first\nsignal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while the\nsecond signal of three knocks means ‘something important to tell you.’\nHis honor has shown me them several times and explained them. And as in\nthe whole universe no one knows of these signals but myself and his\nhonor, so he’d open the door without the slightest hesitation and\nwithout calling out (he is awfully afraid of calling out aloud). Well,\nthose signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch too, now.”",
            "7": "“How are they known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?”\n\n“It was through fright I did it. How could I dare to keep it back from\nhim? Dmitri Fyodorovitch kept persisting every day, ‘You are deceiving\nme, you are hiding something from me! I’ll break both your legs for\nyou.’ So I told him those secret signals that he might see my slavish\ndevotion, and might be satisfied that I was not deceiving him, but was\ntelling him all I could.”\n\n“If you think that he’ll make use of those signals and try to get in,\ndon’t let him in.”\n\n“But if I should be laid up with a fit, how can I prevent him coming in\nthen, even if I dared prevent him, knowing how desperate he is?”\n\n“Hang it! How can you be so sure you are going to have a fit, confound\nyou? Are you laughing at me?”\n\n“How could I dare laugh at you? I am in no laughing humor with this\nfear on me. I feel I am going to have a fit. I have a presentiment.\nFright alone will bring it on.”\n\n“Confound it! If you are laid up, Grigory will be on the watch. Let\nGrigory know beforehand; he will be sure not to let him in.”\n\n“I should never dare to tell Grigory Vassilyevitch about the signals\nwithout orders from my master. And as for Grigory Vassilyevitch hearing\nhim and not admitting him, he has been ill ever since yesterday, and\nMarfa Ignatyevna intends to give him medicine to‐morrow. They’ve just\narranged it. It’s a very strange remedy of hers. Marfa Ignatyevna knows\nof a preparation and always keeps it. It’s a strong thing made from\nsome herb. She has the secret of it, and she always gives it to Grigory\nVassilyevitch three times a year when his lumbago’s so bad he is almost\nparalyzed by it. Then she takes a towel, wets it with the stuff, and\nrubs his whole back for half an hour till it’s quite red and swollen,\nand what’s left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special\nprayer; but not quite all, for on such occasions she leaves some for\nherself, and drinks it herself. And as they never take strong drink, I\nassure you they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long\ntime. And when Grigory Vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well\nafter it, but Marfa Ignatyevna always has a headache from it. So, if\nMarfa Ignatyevna carries out her intention to‐ morrow, they won’t hear\nanything and hinder Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They’ll be asleep.”",
            "8": "“What a rigmarole! And it all seems to happen at once, as though it\nwere planned. You’ll have a fit and they’ll both be unconscious,” cried\nIvan. “But aren’t you trying to arrange it so?” broke from him\nsuddenly, and he frowned threateningly.\n\n“How could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri\nFyodorovitch and his plans?... If he means to do anything, he’ll do it;\nbut if not, I shan’t be thrusting him upon his father.”\n\n“And why should he go to father, especially on the sly, if, as you say\nyourself, Agrafena Alexandrovna won’t come at all?” Ivan went on,\nturning white with anger. “You say that yourself, and all the while\nI’ve been here, I’ve felt sure it was all the old man’s fancy, and the\ncreature won’t come to him. Why should Dmitri break in on him if she\ndoesn’t come? Speak, I want to know what you are thinking!”\n\n“You know yourself why he’ll come. What’s the use of what I think? His\nhonor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account\nof my illness perhaps, and he’ll dash in, as he did yesterday through\nimpatience to search the rooms, to see whether she hasn’t escaped him\non the sly. He is perfectly well aware, too, that Fyodor Pavlovitch has\na big envelope with three thousand roubles in it, tied up with ribbon\nand sealed with three seals. On it is written in his own hand, ‘To my\nangel Grushenka, if she will come,’ to which he added three days later,\n‘for my little chicken.’ There’s no knowing what that might do.”\n\n“Nonsense!” cried Ivan, almost beside himself. “Dmitri won’t come to\nsteal money and kill my father to do it. He might have killed him\nyesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he is,\nbut he won’t steal.”",
            "9": "“He is in very great need of money now—the greatest need, Ivan\nFyodorovitch. You don’t know in what need he is,” Smerdyakov explained,\nwith perfect composure and remarkable distinctness. “He looks on that\nthree thousand as his own, too. He said so to me himself. ‘My father\nstill owes me just three thousand,’ he said. And besides that,\nconsider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true.\nIt’s as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will\nforce him, if only she cares to, to marry her—the master himself, I\nmean, Fyodor Pavlovitch—if only she cares to, and of course she may\ncare to. All I’ve said is that she won’t come, but maybe she’s looking\nfor more than that—I mean to be mistress here. I know myself that\nSamsonov, her merchant, was laughing with her about it, telling her\nquite openly that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do. And\nshe’s got plenty of sense. She wouldn’t marry a beggar like Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch,\nreflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your\nbrother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the master’s\ndeath, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply\nto get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your father\nwere to die now, there’d be some forty thousand for sure, even for\nDmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he’s made no will.... Dmitri\nFyodorovitch knows all that very well.”\n\nA sort of shudder passed over Ivan’s face. He suddenly flushed.\n\n“Then why on earth,” he suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, “do you advise\nme to go to Tchermashnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you\nsee what will happen here.” Ivan drew his breath with difficulty.\n\n“Precisely so,” said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan\nintently, however.\n\n“What do you mean by ‘precisely so’?” Ivan questioned him, with a\nmenacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty.\n\n“I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should\nsimply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,”\nanswered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan’s\nflashing eyes. They were both silent.",
            "10": "“You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what’s more ... an awful\nscoundrel, too.” Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to\npass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to\nSmerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit\nhis lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung\nhimself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same\nmoment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without\nmischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in\nperplexity, to the gate.\n\n“I am going away to Moscow to‐morrow, if you care to know—early\nto‐morrow morning. That’s all!” he suddenly said aloud angrily, and\nwondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to\nSmerdyakov.\n\n“That’s the best thing you can do,” he responded, as though he had\nexpected to hear it; “except that you can always be telegraphed for\nfrom Moscow, if anything should happen here.”\n\nIvan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a\nchange had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness\nhad completely disappeared. His face expressed attention and\nexpectation, intent but timid and cringing.\n\n“Haven’t you something more to say—something to add?” could be read in\nthe intent gaze he fixed on Ivan.\n\n“And couldn’t I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too—in case anything\nhappened?” Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his\nvoice.\n\n“From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,” Smerdyakov\nmuttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing\nintently into Ivan’s eyes.\n\n“Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. Is it to save my\nspending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way,\nthat you insist on Tchermashnya?”\n\n“Precisely so ...” muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He\nlooked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw\nback. But to his astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through\nthe gate still laughing. Any one who had seen his face at that moment\nwould have known that he was not laughing from lightness of heart, and\nhe could not have explained himself what he was feeling at that\ninstant. He moved and walked as though in a nervous frenzy."

Meeting Fyodor\nPavlovitch in the drawing‐room directly he went in, he shouted to him,\nwaving his hands, “I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you.\nGood‐by!” and passed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very\npossibly the old man was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an\nunceremonious display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor\nPavlovitch. And the old man evidently wanted to tell him something at\nonce and had come to meet him in the drawing‐room on purpose.

            "1": "It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He sat up\nlate that night, till two o’clock. But we will not give an account of\nhis thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul—its turn\nwill come. And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an\naccount of them, for there were no thoughts in his brain, but something\nvery vague, and, above all, intense excitement. He felt himself that he\nhad lost his bearings. He was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and\nalmost surprising desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had\nan intense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to\nthe lodge and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could\nnot have given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed the\nvalet as one who had insulted him more gravely than any one in the\nworld. On the other hand, he was more than once that night overcome by\na sort of inexplicable humiliating terror, which he felt positively\nparalyzed his physical powers. His head ached and he was giddy. A\nfeeling of hatred was rankling in his heart, as though he meant to\navenge himself on some one. He even hated Alyosha, recalling the\nconversation he had just had with him. At moments he hated himself\nintensely. Of Katerina Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered\ngreatly at this afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that\nwhen he had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would\ngo away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his heart,\n“That’s nonsense, you are not going, and it won’t be so easy to tear\nyourself away as you are boasting now.”",
            "2": "Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar\nrepulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily,\nas though he were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on\nthe staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below,\nhad listened a long while—some five minutes—with a sort of strange\ncuriosity, holding his breath while his heart throbbed. And why he had\ndone all this, why he was listening, he could not have said. That\n“action” all his life afterwards he called “infamous,” and at the\nbottom of his heart, he thought of it as the basest action of his life.\nFor Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was\nsimply intensely curious to know how he was walking down there below\nand what he must be doing now. He wondered and imagined how he must be\npeeping out of the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room,\nlistening, listening—for some one to knock. Ivan went out on to the\nstairs twice to listen like this.",
            "3": "About two o’clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch\nhad gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep\nat once, as he felt fearfully exhausted. And he did fall asleep at\nonce, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven\no’clock, when it was broad daylight. Opening his eyes, he was surprised\nto feel himself extraordinarily vigorous. He jumped up at once and\ndressed quickly; then dragged out his trunk and began packing\nimmediately. His linen had come back from the laundress the previous\nmorning. Ivan positively smiled at the thought that everything was\nhelping his sudden departure. And his departure certainly was sudden.\nThough Ivan had said the day before (to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and\nSmerdyakov) that he was leaving next day, yet he remembered that he had\nno thought of departure when he went to bed, or, at least, had not\ndreamed that his first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk.\nAt last his trunk and bag were ready. It was about nine o’clock when\nMarfa Ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry, “Where will your honor\ntake your tea, in your own room or downstairs?” He looked almost\ncheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,\nsomething hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and even\ninquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait to hear\nhis answer to the end, he announced that he was starting off in an hour\nto return to Moscow for good, and begged him to send for the horses.\nHis father heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot\nin an unmannerly way to show regret at losing him. Instead of doing so,\nhe flew into a great flutter at the recollection of some important\nbusiness of his own.\n\n“What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we’ll\nmanage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy. Go to\nTchermashnya on the way. It’s only to turn to the left from the station\nat Volovya, only another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I can’t. It’s eighty versts to the railway and the train\nstarts for Moscow at seven o’clock to‐night. I can only just catch it.”",
            "4": "“You’ll catch it to‐morrow or the day after, but to‐day turn off to\nTchermashnya. It won’t put you out much to humor your father! If I\nhadn’t had something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long\nago, for I’ve some business there in a hurry. But here I ... it’s not\nthe time for me to go now.... You see, I’ve two pieces of copse land\nthere. The Maslovs, an old merchant and his son, will give eight\nthousand for the timber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who\nwould have given twelve. There’s no getting any one about here to buy\nit. The Maslovs have it all their own way. One has to take what they’ll\ngive, for no one here dare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe\nwrote to me last Thursday that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I\nknow, had turned up. What makes him valuable is that he is not from\nthese parts, so he is not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give\nme eleven thousand for the copse. Do you hear? But he’ll only be here,\nthe priest writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and\nmake a bargain with him.”\n\n“Well, you write to the priest; he’ll make the bargain.”\n\n“He can’t do it. He has no eye for business. He is a perfect treasure,\nI’d give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt;\nbut he has no eye for business, he is a perfect child, a crow could\ndeceive him. And yet he is a learned man, would you believe it? This\nGorstkin looks like a peasant, he wears a blue kaftan, but he is a\nregular rogue. That’s the common complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he\ntells such lies that you wonder why he is doing it. He told me the year\nbefore last that his wife was dead and that he had married another, and\nwould you believe it, there was not a word of truth in it? His wife has\nnever died at all, she is alive to this day and gives him a beating\ntwice a week. So what you have to find out is whether he is lying or\nspeaking the truth, when he says he wants to buy it and would give\neleven thousand.”\n\n“I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.”",
            "5": "“Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by\nwhich you can judge about Gorstkin. I’ve done business with him a long\ntime. You see, you must watch his beard; he has a nasty, thin, red\nbeard. If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross, it’s all\nright, he is saying what he means, he wants to do business. But if he\nstrokes his beard with his left hand and grins—he is trying to cheat\nyou. Don’t watch his eyes, you won’t find out anything from his eyes,\nhe is a deep one, a rogue—but watch his beard! I’ll give you a note and\nyou show it to him. He’s called Gorstkin, though his real name is\nLyagavy;[4] but don’t call him so, he will be offended. If you come to\nan understanding with him, and see it’s all right, write here at once.\nYou need only write: ‘He’s not lying.’ Stand out for eleven thousand;\none thousand you can knock off, but not more. Just think! there’s a\ndifference between eight thousand and eleven thousand. It’s as good as\npicking up three thousand; it’s not so easy to find a purchaser, and\nI’m in desperate need of money. Only let me know it’s serious, and I’ll\nrun over and fix it up. I’ll snatch the time somehow. But what’s the\ngood of my galloping over, if it’s all a notion of the priest’s? Come,\nwill you go?”\n\n“Oh, I can’t spare the time. You must excuse me.”\n\n“Come, you might oblige your father. I shan’t forget it. You’ve no\nheart, any of you—that’s what it is? What’s a day or two to you? Where\nare you going now—to Venice? Your Venice will keep another two days. I\nwould have sent Alyosha, but what use is Alyosha in a thing like that?\nI send you just because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don’t\nsee that? You know nothing about timber, but you’ve got an eye. All\nthat is wanted is to see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you,\nwatch his beard—if his beard shakes you know he is in earnest.”\n\n“You force me to go to that damned Tchermashnya yourself, then?” cried\nIvan, with a malignant smile.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch did not catch, or would not catch, the malignancy,\nbut he caught the smile.\n\n“Then you’ll go, you’ll go? I’ll scribble the note for you at once.”\n\n“I don’t know whether I shall go. I don’t know. I’ll decide on the\nway.”\n\n“Nonsense! Decide at once. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle the\nmatter, write me a line; give it to the priest and he’ll send it on to\nme at once. And I won’t delay you more than that. You can go to Venice.\nThe priest will give you horses back to Volovya station.”",
            "6": "The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent for the\nhorses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor\nPavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to‐day he\nseemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a\nword. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a\nloss for something to say. Ivan noticed this particularly. “He must be\nbored with me,” he thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to\nthe steps, the old man began to fuss about. He would have kissed him,\nbut Ivan made haste to hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss.\nHis father saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up.\n\n“Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!” he repeated from the steps.\n“You’ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always\nbe glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!”\n\nIvan got into the carriage.\n\n“Good‐by, Ivan! Don’t be too hard on me!” the father called for the\nlast time.\n\nThe whole household came out to take leave—Smerdyakov, Marfa and\nGrigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in\nthe carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.\n\n“You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,” broke suddenly from Ivan.\nAgain, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and\nhe laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long\nafter.\n\n“It’s a true saying then, that ‘it’s always worth while speaking to a\nclever man,’ ” answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at\nIvan.",
            "7": "The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan’s soul, but he\nlooked eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at\na flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all of a\nsudden he felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and he felt\nintensely interested in an answer the peasant made him; but a minute\nlater he realized that he was not catching anything, and that he had\nnot really even taken in the peasant’s answer. He was silent, and it\nwas pleasant even so. The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright.\nThe images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his mind. But\nhe softly smiled, blew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew\naway. “There’s plenty of time for them,” he thought. They reached the\nstation quickly, changed horses, and galloped to Volovya. “Why is it\nworth while speaking to a clever man? What did he mean by that?” The\nthought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. “And why did I tell\nhim I was going to Tchermashnya?” They reached Volovya station. Ivan\ngot out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round him bargaining\nover the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya. He told them to\nharness the horses. He went into the station house, looked round,\nglanced at the overseer’s wife, and suddenly went back to the entrance.\n\n“I won’t go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by\nseven, brothers?”\n\n“We shall just do it. Shall we get the carriage out?”\n\n“At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to‐morrow?”\n\n“To be sure. Mitri here will.”\n\n“Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father’s, to Fyodor\nPavlovitch Karamazov, and tell him I haven’t gone to Tchermashnya. Can\nyou?”\n\n“Of course I can. I’ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.”\n\n“And here’s something for you, for I dare say he won’t give you\nanything,” said Ivan, laughing gayly.\n\n“You may depend on it he won’t.” Mitya laughed too. “Thank you, sir.\nI’ll be sure to do it.”\n\nAt seven o’clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow “Away\nwith the past. I’ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no\nnews, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!”\nBut instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his\nheart ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life\nbefore. He was thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at\ndaybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself\nfrom his meditation.\n\n“I am a scoundrel,” he whispered to himself.",
            "8": "Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off.\nFor two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy.\nBut suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant\nfor every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\nequanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and\nfell down from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was\nin the yard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard\nhis scream—the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her—the\nscream of the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether\nthe fit had come on him at the moment he was descending the steps, so\nthat he must have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and\nthe shock that had caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be\nliable to them. They found him at the bottom of the cellar steps,\nwrithing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth. It was thought at\nfirst that he must have broken something—an arm or a leg—and hurt\nhimself, but “God had preserved him,” as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed\nit—nothing of the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get him\nout of the cellar. They asked the neighbors to help and managed it\nsomehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole ceremony.\nHe helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick man did not regain\nconsciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then began again,\nand every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as had\nhappened a year before, when he accidentally fell from the garret. They\nremembered that ice had been put on his head then. There was still ice\nin the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the\nevening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at\nonce. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and\nconscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination, he\nconcluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious\nconsequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not fully understand\nit, but that by to‐morrow morning, if the present remedies were\nunavailing, he would venture to try something else. The invalid was\ntaken to the lodge, to a room next to Grigory’s and Marfa Ignatyevna’s.",
            "9": "Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with\nthat day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared\nwith Smerdyakov’s, was “no better than dish‐water,” and the fowl was so\ndried up that it was impossible to masticate it. To her master’s\nbitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the\nfowl was a very old one to begin with, and that she had never been\ntrained as a cook. In the evening there was another trouble in store\nfor Fyodor Pavlovitch; he was informed that Grigory, who had not been\nwell for the last three days, was completely laid up by his lumbago.\nFyodor Pavlovitch finished his tea as early as possible and locked\nhimself up alone in the house. He was in terrible excitement and\nsuspense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka’s coming almost as a\ncertainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance\n“that she had promised to come without fail.” The incorrigible old\nman’s heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty\nrooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the\nwatch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov\nhad informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to\nknock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the\npassage, for fear—which God forbid!—that she should be frightened and\nrun away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his\nheart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say\nalmost certainly that she would come!\n\n\n\n\nBook VI.

            "0": "When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder’s\ncell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his\nlast gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw\nhim sitting up in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face\nwas bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a\nquiet and joyful conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a\nquarter of an hour before Alyosha’s arrival; his visitors had gathered\ntogether in his cell earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received\na most confident assurance from Father Païssy that “the teacher would\nget up, and as he had himself promised in the morning, converse once\nmore with those dear to his heart.” This promise and indeed every word\nof the dying elder Father Païssy put implicit trust in. If he had seen\nhim unconscious, if he had seen him breathe his last, and yet had his\npromise that he would rise up and say good‐by to him, he would not have\nbelieved perhaps even in death, but would still have expected the dead\nman to recover and fulfill his promise. In the morning as he lay down\nto sleep, Father Zossima had told him positively: “I shall not die\nwithout the delight of another conversation with you, beloved of my\nheart. I shall look once more on your dear face and pour out my heart\nto you once again.” The monks, who had gathered for this probably last\nconversation with Father Zossima, had all been his devoted friends for\nmany years. There were four of them: Father Iosif and Father Païssy,\nFather Mihaïl, the warden of the hermitage, a man not very old and far\nfrom being learned. He was of humble origin, of strong will and\nsteadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deep tenderness, though\nhe obviously concealed it as though he were almost ashamed of it. The\nfourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little monk of the\npoorest peasant class. He was almost illiterate, and very quiet,\nscarcely speaking to any one. He was the humblest of the humble, and\nlooked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful\nbeyond the scope of his intelligence. Father Zossima had a great\naffection for this timorous man, and always treated him with marked\nrespect, though perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had\nsaid less, in spite of the fact that he had spent years wandering about\nholy Russia with him. That was very long ago, forty years before, when\nFather Zossima first began his life as a monk in a poor and little\nmonastery at Kostroma, and when, shortly after, he had accompanied\nFather Anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms for their poor\nmonastery.",
            "1": "The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, was\nvery small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them (in\naddition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood) to sit round Father Zossima\non chairs brought from the sitting‐room. It was already beginning to\nget dark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before\nthe ikons.\n\nSeeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima\nsmiled at him joyfully and held out his hand.\n\n“Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew you\nwould come.”\n\nAlyosha went up to him, bowed down before him to the ground and wept.\nSomething surged up from his heart, his soul was quivering, he wanted\nto sob.\n\n“Come, don’t weep over me yet,” Father Zossima smiled, laying his right\nhand on his head. “You see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall live\nanother twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, with\nher little Lizaveta in her arms, wished me yesterday. God bless the\nmother and the little girl Lizaveta,” he crossed himself. “Porfiry, did\nyou take her offering where I told you?”\n\nHe meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the\ngood‐humored woman to be given “to some one poorer than me.” Such\nofferings, always of money gained by personal toil, are made by way of\npenance voluntarily undertaken. The elder had sent Porfiry the evening\nbefore to a widow, whose house had been burnt down lately, and who\nafter the fire had gone with her children begging alms. Porfiry\nhastened to reply that he had given the money, as he had been\ninstructed, “from an unknown benefactress.”\n\n“Get up, my dear boy,” the elder went on to Alyosha. “Let me look at\nyou. Have you been home and seen your brother?” It seemed strange to\nAlyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his\nbrothers only—but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both\nyesterday and to‐day for the sake of that brother.\n\n“I have seen one of my brothers,” answered Alyosha.\n\n“I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.”\n\n“I only saw him yesterday and could not find him to‐day,” said Alyosha.\n\n“Make haste to find him, go again to‐morrow and make haste, leave\neverything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent\nsomething terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in\nstore for him.”",
            "2": "He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were\nstrange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged\nglances with Father Païssy. Alyosha could not resist asking:\n\n“Father and teacher,” he began with extreme emotion, “your words are\ntoo obscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?”",
            "3": "“Don’t inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as\nthough his whole future were expressed in his eyes. A look came into\nhis eyes—so that I was instantly horror‐stricken at what that man is\npreparing for himself. Once or twice in my life I’ve seen such a look\nin a man’s face ... reflecting as it were his future fate, and that\nfate, alas, came to pass. I sent you to him, Alexey, for I thought your\nbrotherly face would help him. But everything and all our fates are\nfrom the Lord. ‘Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it\nabideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’ Remember\nthat. You, Alexey, I’ve many times silently blessed for your face, know\nthat,” added the elder with a gentle smile. “This is what I think of\nyou, you will go forth from these walls, but will live like a monk in\nthe world. You will have many enemies, but even your foes will love\nyou. Life will bring you many misfortunes, but you will find your\nhappiness in them, and will bless life and will make others bless\nit—which is what matters most. Well, that is your character. Fathers\nand teachers,” he addressed his friends with a tender smile, “I have\nnever till to‐day told even him why the face of this youth is so dear\nto me. Now I will tell you. His face has been as it were a remembrance\nand a prophecy for me. At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had\nan elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen. And later on in\nthe course of my life I gradually became convinced that that brother\nhad been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me. For had he not\ncome into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, have\nbecome a monk and entered on this precious path. He appeared first to\nme in my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he seems to\nhave come to me over again. It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that\nAlexey, who has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to\nme so like him spiritually, that many times I have taken him for that\nyoung man, my brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my\npilgrimage, as a reminder and an inspiration. So that I positively\nwondered at so strange a dream in myself. Do you hear this, Porfiry?”\nhe turned to the novice who waited on him. “Many times I’ve seen in\nyour face as it were a look of mortification that I love Alexey more\nthan you. Now you know why that was so, but I love you too, know that,\nand many times I grieved at your mortification. I should like to tell\nyou, dear friends, of that youth, my brother, for there has been no\npresence in my life more precious, more significant and touching. My\nheart is full of tenderness, and I look at my whole life at this moment\nas though living through it again.”",
            "4": "\nHere I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with\nthe friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partly\npreserved in writing. Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down from\nmemory, some time after his elder’s death. But whether this was only\nthe conversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his\nnotes of parts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot\ndetermine. In his account, Father Zossima’s talk goes on without\ninterruption, as though he told his life to his friends in the form of\na story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the\nconversation that evening was general. Though the guests did not\ninterrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told\nsomething themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on\nan uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath,\nhis voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though\nhe did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once\nor twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Païssy’s reading\nthe Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed\nthat he would die that night, for on that evening of his life after his\ndeep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength,\nwhich kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a last\neffort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time,\nhowever, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that later.\nI will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the\naccount given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and\nnot so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a\ngreat deal from previous conversations and added them to it.\n\nNotes of the Life of the deceased Priest and Monk, the Elder Zossima,\ntaken from his own words by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES\n\n\n_(a)_ _Father Zossima’s Brother_",
            "5": "\nBeloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the\nnorth, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no\ngreat consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old,\nand I don’t remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built\nof wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and her\nchildren in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and\nI. He was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament,\nbut kind‐hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent,\nespecially at home with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well\nat school, but did not get on with his schoolfellows, though he never\nquarreled, at least so my mother has told me. Six months before his\ndeath, when he was seventeen, he made friends with a political exile\nwho had been banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led\na solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained\ndistinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him take a\nfancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The young man would\nspend whole evenings with him during that winter, till the exile was\nsummoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his own request, as\nhe had powerful friends.\n\nIt was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude\nand laughed at it. “That’s all silly twaddle, and there is no God,” he\nsaid, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was\nonly nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four\nservants, all serfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the\ncook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and\nhiring a free servant to take her place.",
            "6": "In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a\ntendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin and\ndelicate‐ looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he\ncaught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother\nthat it was galloping consumption, that he would not live through the\nspring. My mother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother,\nshe entreated him to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament,\nas he was still able to move about. This made him angry, and he said\nsomething profane about the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he\nguessed at once that he was seriously ill, and that that was why his\nmother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament. He had been\naware, indeed, for a long time past, that he was far from well, and had\na year before coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me, “My life\nwon’t be long among you, I may not live another year,” which seemed now\nlike a prophecy.\n\nThree days passed and Holy Week had come. And on Tuesday morning my\nbrother began going to church. “I am doing this simply for your sake,\nmother, to please and comfort you,” he said. My mother wept with joy\nand grief. “His end must be near,” she thought, “if there’s such a\nchange in him.” But he was not able to go to church long, he took to\nhis bed, so he had to confess and take the sacrament at home.\n\nIt was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of\nfragrance. I remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly, but\nin the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm‐chair. That’s\nhow I remember him sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his face bright\nand joyous, in spite of his illness. A marvelous change passed over\nhim, his spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and\nsay, “Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.” And once\nhe would not have allowed it and would have blown it out.\n\n“Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing\nit. You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I\nrejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.”\n\nThose words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her room and\nweep, but when she went in to him she wiped her eyes and looked\ncheerful. “Mother, don’t weep, darling,” he would say, “I’ve long to\nlive yet, long to rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.”",
            "7": "“Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night,\ncoughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.”\n\n“Don’t cry, mother,” he would answer, “life is paradise, and we are all\nin paradise, but we won’t see it, if we would, we should have heaven on\nearth the next day.”\n\nEvery one wondered at his words, he spoke so strangely and positively;\nwe were all touched and wept. Friends came to see us. “Dear ones,” he\nwould say to them, “what have I done that you should love me so, how\ncan you love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not\nappreciate it before?”\n\nWhen the servants came in to him he would say continually, “Dear, kind\npeople, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on?\nIf it were God’s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men\nshould wait on one another.”\n\nMother shook her head as she listened. “My darling, it’s your illness\nmakes you talk like that.”\n\n“Mother, darling,” he would say, “there must be servants and masters,\nbut if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to\nme. And another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all\nmen, and I more than any.”\n\nMother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. “Why, how\ncould you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers and\nmurderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you\nhold yourself more guilty than all?”\n\n“Mother, little heart of mine,” he said (he had begun using such\nstrange caressing words at that time), “little heart of mine, my joy,\nbelieve me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men and\nfor everything. I don’t know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is\nso, painfully even. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry\nand not knowing?”\n\nSo he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full\nof love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came:\n\n“Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?” he would ask, joking.\n\n“You’ll live many days yet,” the doctor would answer, “and months and\nyears too.”\n\n“Months and years!” he would exclaim. “Why reckon the days? One day is\nenough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we\nquarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each\nother? Let’s go straight into the garden, walk and play there, love,\nappreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life.”",
            "8": "“Your son cannot last long,” the doctor told my mother, as she\naccompanied him to the door. “The disease is affecting his brain.”\n\nThe windows of his room looked out into the garden, and our garden was\na shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The first\nbirds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing\nat the windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began\nsuddenly begging their forgiveness too: “Birds of heaven, happy birds,\nforgive me, for I have sinned against you too.” None of us could\nunderstand that at the time, but he shed tears of joy. “Yes,” he said,\n“there was such a glory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows,\nsky; only I lived in shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the\nbeauty and glory.”\n\n“You take too many sins on yourself,” mother used to say, weeping.\n\n“Mother, darling, it’s for joy, not for grief I am crying. Though I\ncan’t explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I\ndon’t know how to love them enough. If I have sinned against every one,\nyet all forgive me, too, and that’s heaven. Am I not in heaven now?”\n\nAnd there was a great deal more I don’t remember. I remember I went\nonce into his room when there was no one else there. It was a bright\nevening, the sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He\nbeckoned me, and I went up to him. He put his hands on my shoulders and\nlooked into my face tenderly, lovingly; he said nothing for a minute,\nonly looked at me like that.\n\n“Well,” he said, “run and play now, enjoy life for me too.”\n\nI went out then and ran to play. And many times in my life afterwards I\nremembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too.\nThere were many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his, though we\ndid not understand them at the time. He died the third week after\nEaster. He was fully conscious though he could not talk; up to his last\nhour he did not change. He looked happy, his eyes beamed and sought us,\nhe smiled at us, beckoned us. There was a great deal of talk even in\nthe town about his death. I was impressed by all this at the time, but\nnot too much so, though I cried a good deal at his funeral. I was young\nthen, a child, but a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all,\nremained in my heart, ready to rise up and respond when the time came.\nSo indeed it happened.\n\n_(b) Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima_",
            "9": "\nI was left alone with my mother. Her friends began advising her to send\nme to Petersburg as other parents did. “You have only one son now,”\nthey said, “and have a fair income, and you will be depriving him\nperhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him here.” They suggested I\nshould be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might\nafterwards enter the Imperial Guard. My mother hesitated for a long\ntime, it was awful to part with her only child, but she made up her\nmind to it at last, though not without many tears, believing she was\nacting for my happiness. She brought me to Petersburg and put me into\nthe Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again. For she too died three\nyears afterwards. She spent those three years mourning and grieving for\nboth of us.",
            "10": "From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious\nmemories, for there are no memories more precious than those of early\nchildhood in one’s first home. And that is almost always so if there is\nany love and harmony in the family at all. Indeed, precious memories\nmay remain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what\nis precious. With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the\nBible, which, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home. I had a\nbook of Scripture history then with excellent pictures, called _A\nHundred and Four Stories from the Old and New Testament_, and I learned\nto read from it. I have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a\nprecious relic of the past. But even before I learned to read, I\nremember first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old. My\nmother took me alone to mass (I don’t remember where my brother was at\nthe time) on the Monday before Easter. It was a fine day, and I\nremember to‐day, as though I saw it now, how the incense rose from the\ncenser and softly floated upwards and, overhead in the cupola, mingled\nin rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the little\nwindow. I was stirred by the sight, and for the first time in my life I\nconsciously received the seed of God’s word in my heart. A youth came\nout into the middle of the church carrying a big book, so large that at\nthe time I fancied he could scarcely carry it. He laid it on the\nreading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for the first\ntime I understood something read in the church of God. In the land of\nUz, there lived a man, righteous and God‐fearing, and he had great\nwealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his children\nfeasted, and he loved them very much and prayed for them. “It may be\nthat my sons have sinned in their feasting.” Now the devil came before\nthe Lord together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he\nhad gone up and down the earth and under the earth. “And hast thou\nconsidered my servant Job?” God asked of him. And God boasted to the\ndevil, pointing to his great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at\nGod’s words. “Give him over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant\nwill murmur against Thee and curse Thy name.” And God gave up the just\nman He loved so, to the devil. And the devil smote his children and his\ncattle and scattered his wealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt\nfrom heaven. And Job rent his mantle and fell down upon the ground and\ncried aloud, “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I\nreturn into the earth; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.\nBlessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever.”",
            "11": "Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises\nup again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the\nbreast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and\nwonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination, and\nSatan, who talked like that with God, and God who gave His servant up\nto destruction, and His servant crying out: “Blessed be Thy name\nalthough Thou dost punish me,” and then the soft and sweet singing in\nthe church: “Let my prayer rise up before Thee,” and again incense from\nthe priest’s censer and the kneeling and the prayer. Ever since\nthen—only yesterday I took it up—I’ve never been able to read that\nsacred tale without tears. And how much that is great, mysterious and\nunfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard the words of mockery\nand blame, proud words, “How could God give up the most loved of His\nsaints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his children,\nsmite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his\nsores with a pot‐sherd—and for no object except to boast to the devil!\n‘See what My saint can suffer for My sake.’ ” But the greatness of it\nlies just in the fact that it is a mystery—that the passing earthly\nshow and the eternal verity are brought together in it. In the face of\nthe earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just\nas on the first days of creation He ended each day with praise: “That\nis good that I have created,” looks upon Job and again praises His\ncreation. And Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him but all His\ncreation for generations and generations, and for ever and ever, since\nfor that he was ordained. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what\nlessons there are in it! What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what\nstrength is given with it to man! It is like a mold cast of the world\nand man and human nature, everything is there, and a law for everything\nfor all the ages. And what mysteries are solved and revealed! God\nraises Job again, gives him wealth again. Many years pass by, and he\nhas other children and loves them. But how could he love those new ones\nwhen those first children are no more, when he has lost them?\nRemembering them, how could he be fully happy with those new ones,\nhowever dear the new ones might be? But he could, he could. It’s the\ngreat mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet,\ntender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous\nblood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my\nhearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long\nslanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with\nthem, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life—and over\nall the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life is\nending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my\nearthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching\nlife, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my\nmind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.",
            "12": "Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one may\nhear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village\npriests, are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and\ntheir humiliating lot. They plainly state, even in print—I’ve read it\nmyself—that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people\nbecause of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics\ncome and lead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because\nthey have so little to live upon. May the Lord increase the sustenance\nthat is so precious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a\ntruth I say, if any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is\nours. For he may be short of time, he may say truly that he is\noverwhelmed all the while with work and services, but still it’s not\nall the time, even he has an hour a week to remember God. And he does\nnot work the whole year round. Let him gather round him once a week,\nsome hour in the evening, if only the children at first—the fathers\nwill hear of it and they too will begin to come. There’s no need to\nbuild halls for this, let him take them into his own cottage. They\nwon’t spoil his cottage, they would only be there one hour. Let him\nopen that book and begin reading it without grand words or\nsuperciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly,\nbeing glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with\nattention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to\nexplain words that are not understood by the peasants. Don’t be\nanxious, they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will\nunderstand all! Let him read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac\nand Rebecca, of how Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in\nhis dream and said, “This place is holy”—and he will impress the devout\nmind of the peasant. Let him read, especially to the children, how the\nbrothers sold Joseph, the tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into\nbondage, and told their father that a wild beast had devoured him, and\nshowed him his blood‐ stained clothes. Let him read them how the\nbrothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already\na great ruler, unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept\nhis brother Benjamin, and all through love: “I love you, and loving you\nI torment you.” For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to\nthe merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his\nhands, he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave\nin a strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he\nloved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love.\nHe left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung\nhimself on his bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out\nto them joyful and told them, “Brothers, I am your brother Joseph!” Let\nhim read them further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his\ndarling boy was still alive, and how he went to Egypt leaving his own\ncountry, and died in a foreign land, bequeathing his great prophecy\nthat had lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his\nlife, that from his offspring, from Judah, will come the great hope of\nthe world, the Messiah and Saviour.",
            "13": "Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don’t be angry, that like a little\nchild I’ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a\nhundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive\nmy tears, for I love the Bible. Let him too weep, the priest of God,\nand be sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response.\nOnly a little tiny seed is needed—drop it into the heart of the peasant\nand it won’t die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be\nhidden in the midst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a\ngreat reminder. And there’s no need of much teaching or explanation, he\nwill understand it all simply. Do you suppose that the peasants don’t\nunderstand? Try reading them the touching story of the fair Esther and\nthe haughty Vashti; or the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale.\nDon’t forget either the parables of Our Lord, choose especially from\nthe Gospel of St. Luke (that is what I did), and then from the Acts of\nthe Apostles the conversion of St. Paul (that you mustn’t leave out on\nany account), and from the _Lives of the Saints_, for instance, the\nlife of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr\nand the seer of God, Mary of Egypt—and you will penetrate their hearts\nwith these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it in spite of your\npoverty, only one little hour. And you will see for yourselves that our\npeople is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred‐fold.\nMindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words they have\nheard from him, they will of their own accord help him in his fields\nand in his house, and will treat him with more respect than before—so\nthat it will even increase his worldly well‐being too. The thing is so\nsimple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for fear\nof being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believe\nin God will not believe in God’s people. He who believes in God’s\npeople will see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it\ntill then. Only the people and their future spiritual power will\nconvert our atheists, who have torn themselves away from their native\nsoil.\n\nAnd what is the use of Christ’s words, unless we set an example? The\npeople is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the\nWord and for all that is good.",
            "14": "In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over\nRussia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we\nstayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some\nfishermen. A good‐ looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he\nhad to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant’s barge along the\nbank. I noticed him looking straight before him with clear and tender\neyes. It was a bright, warm, still, July night, a cool mist rose from\nthe broad river, we could hear the plash of a fish, the birds were\nstill, all was hushed and beautiful, everything praying to God. Only we\ntwo were not sleeping, the lad and I, and we talked of the beauty of\nthis world of God’s and of the great mystery of it. Every blade of\ngrass, every insect, ant, and golden bee, all so marvelously know their\npath, though they have not intelligence, they bear witness to the\nmystery of God and continually accomplish it themselves. I saw the dear\nlad’s heart was moved. He told me that he loved the forest and the\nforest birds. He was a bird‐catcher, knew the note of each of them,\ncould call each bird. “I know nothing better than to be in the forest,”\nsaid he, “though all things are good.”\n\n“Truly,” I answered him, “all things are good and fair, because all is\ntruth. Look,” said I, “at the horse, that great beast that is so near\nto man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him and works for him;\nlook at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often\nbeats them mercilessly. What gentleness, what confidence and what\nbeauty! It’s touching to know that there’s no sin in them, for all, all\nexcept man, is sinless, and Christ has been with them before us.”\n\n“Why,” asked the boy, “is Christ with them too?”",
            "15": "“It cannot but be so,” said I, “since the Word is for all. All creation\nand all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory to\nGod, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery\nof their sinless life. Yonder,” said I, “in the forest wanders the\ndreadful bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it.” And I told\nhim how once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a\ntiny cell in the wood. And the great saint pitied him, went up to him\nwithout fear and gave him a piece of bread. “Go along,” said he,\n“Christ be with you,” and the savage beast walked away meekly and\nobediently, doing no harm. And the lad was delighted that the bear had\nwalked away without hurting the saint, and that Christ was with him\ntoo. “Ah,” said he, “how good that is, how good and beautiful is all\nGod’s work!” He sat musing softly and sweetly. I saw he understood. And\nhe slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May God bless youth! And\nI prayed for him as I went to sleep. Lord, send peace and light to Thy\npeople!"

            "0": "_(c) Recollections of Father Zossima’s Youth before he became a Monk.\nThe Duel_\n\nI spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school\nat Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of my\nchildish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing. I picked up\nso many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel,\nabsurd, almost savage creature. A surface polish of courtesy and\nsociety manners I did acquire together with the French language.\n\nBut we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service as\ncattle. I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was so\nmuch more impressionable than my companions. By the time we left the\nschool as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor\nof the regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning\nof honor, and if any one had known it, he would have been the first to\nridicule it. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almost\nprided ourselves on. I don’t say that we were bad by nature, all these\nyoung men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of\nall. What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money,\nand so I flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong\ninto all the recklessness of youth.\n\nI was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I\nnever opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me,\nand I was never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that\nbook “for the day and the hour, for the month and the year,” though I\nknew it not.\n\nAfter four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where\nour regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town\nhospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial\nreception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to\nbe well off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a\ncircumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.",
            "1": "I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of\nnoble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They\nwere well‐to‐do people of influence and position. They always gave me a\ncordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on\nme with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw\nand fully realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with\nher at all, but only recognized the elevation of her mind and\ncharacter, which I could not indeed have helped doing. I was prevented,\nhowever, from making her an offer at the time by my selfishness, I was\nloath to part with the allurements of my free and licentious bachelor\nlife in the heyday of my youth, and with my pockets full of money. I\ndid drop some hint as to my feelings however, though I put off taking\nany decisive step for a time. Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered\noff for two months to another district.\n\nOn my return two months later, I found the young lady already married\nto a rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though\nolder than I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I\nwas not, and of excellent education, which I also was not. I was so\noverwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively\nclouded. The worst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young\nlandowner had been a long while betrothed to her, and I had met him\nindeed many times in her house, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed\nnothing. And this particularly mortified me; almost everybody had known\nall about it, while I knew nothing. I was filled with sudden\nirrepressible fury. With flushed face I began recalling how often I had\nbeen on the point of declaring my love to her, and as she had not\nattempted to stop me or to warn me, she must, I concluded, have been\nlaughing at me all the time. Later on, of course, I reflected and\nremembered that she had been very far from laughing at me; on the\ncontrary, she used to turn off any love‐making on my part with a jest\nand begin talking of other subjects; but at that moment I was incapable\nof reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge. I am surprised to\nremember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant\nto my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found it difficult to\nbe angry with any one for long, and so I had to work myself up\nartificially and became at last revolting and absurd.",
            "2": "I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my “rival” in\nthe presence of a large company. I insulted him on a perfectly\nextraneous pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public\nevent—it was in the year 1826[5]—and my jeer was, so people said,\nclever and effective. Then I forced him to ask for an explanation, and\nbehaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in spite of the vast\ninequality between us, as I was younger, a person of no consequence,\nand of inferior rank. I learned afterwards for a fact that it was from\na jealous feeling on his side also that my challenge was accepted; he\nhad been rather jealous of me on his wife’s account before their\nmarriage; he fancied now that if he submitted to be insulted by me and\nrefused to accept my challenge, and if she heard of it, she might begin\nto despise him and waver in her love for him. I soon found a second in\na comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those days though duels were\nseverely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashion among the\nofficers—so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice sometimes\nbe.\n\nIt was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven\no’clock the next day on the outskirts of the town—and then something\nhappened that in very truth was the turning‐point of my life. In the\nevening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a\nrage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with\nall my might, so that it was covered with blood. He had not long been\nin my service and I had struck him before, but never with such\nferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it’s forty years ago, I\nrecall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed and slept for about\nthree hours; when I waked up the day was breaking. I got up—I did not\nwant to sleep any more—I went to the window—opened it, it looked out\nupon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the\nbirds were singing.",
            "3": "“What’s the meaning of it?” I thought. “I feel in my heart as it were\nsomething vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood?\nNo,” I thought, “I feel it’s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of\ndeath, afraid of being killed? No, that’s not it, that’s not it at\nall.”... And all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had\nbeaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose before my mind, it all\nwas as it were repeated over again; he stood before me and I was\nbeating him straight on the face and he was holding his arms stiffly\ndown, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me as though on parade. He\nstaggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his hands to\nprotect himself. That is what a man has been brought to, and that was a\nman beating a fellow creature! What a crime! It was as though a sharp\ndagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if I were struck dumb,\nwhile the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were\ntrilling the praise of God.... I hid my face in my hands, fell on my\nbed and broke into a storm of tears. And then I remembered my brother\nMarkel and what he said on his death‐bed to his servants: “My dear\nones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your\nwaiting on me?”\n\n“Yes, am I worth it?” flashed through my mind. “After all what am I\nworth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and\nimage of God, should serve me?” For the first time in my life this\nquestion forced itself upon me. He had said, “Mother, my little heart,\nin truth we are each responsible to all for all, it’s only that men\ndon’t know this. If they knew it, the world would be a paradise at\nonce.”\n\n“God, can that too be false?” I thought as I wept. “In truth, perhaps,\nI am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than\nall men in the world.” And all at once the whole truth in its full\nlight appeared to me; what was I going to do? I was going to kill a\ngood, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his\nwife of happiness for the rest of her life, I should be torturing and\nkilling her too. I lay thus in my bed with my face in the pillow,\nheedless how the time was passing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came\nin with the pistols to fetch me.\n\n“Ah,” said he, “it’s a good thing you are up already, it’s time we were\noff, come along!”\n\nI did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out\nto the carriage, however.",
            "4": "“Wait here a minute,” I said to him. “I’ll be back directly, I have\nforgotten my purse.”\n\nAnd I ran back alone, to Afanasy’s little room.\n\n“Afanasy,” I said, “I gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgive\nme,” I said.\n\nHe started as though he were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw\nthat it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer’s uniform,\nI dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground.\n\n“Forgive me,” I said.\n\nThen he was completely aghast.\n\n“Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it?”\n\nAnd he burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his\nhands, turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs. I flew\nout to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.\n\n“Ready,” I cried. “Have you ever seen a conqueror?” I asked him. “Here\nis one before you.”\n\nI was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don’t remember\nwhat about.\n\nHe looked at me. “Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you’ll keep\nup the honor of the uniform, I can see.”\n\nSo we reached the place and found them there, waiting us. We were\nplaced twelve paces apart; he had the first shot. I stood gayly,\nlooking him full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked\nlovingly at him, for I knew what I would do. His shot just grazed my\ncheek and ear.\n\n“Thank God,” I cried, “no man has been killed,” and I seized my pistol,\nturned back and flung it far away into the wood. “That’s the place for\nyou,” I cried.\n\nI turned to my adversary.\n\n“Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,” I said, “for my unprovoked\ninsult to you and for forcing you to fire at me. I am ten times worse\nthan you and more, maybe. Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest\nin the world.”\n\nI had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.\n\n“Upon my word,” cried my adversary, annoyed, “if you did not want to\nfight, why did not you let me alone?”\n\n“Yesterday I was a fool, to‐day I know better,” I answered him gayly.\n\n“As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to‐day, it is difficult to\nagree with your opinion,” said he.\n\n“Bravo,” I cried, clapping my hands. “I agree with you there too. I\nhave deserved it!”\n\n“Will you shoot, sir, or not?”\n\n“No, I won’t,” I said; “if you like, fire at me again, but it would be\nbetter for you not to fire.”\n\nThe seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: “Can you disgrace the\nregiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness!\nIf I’d only known this!”\n\nI stood facing them all, not laughing now.",
            "5": "“Gentlemen,” I said, “is it really so wonderful in these days to find a\nman who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his\nwrongdoing?”\n\n“But not in a duel,” cried my second again.\n\n“That’s what’s so strange,” I said. “For I ought to have owned my fault\nas soon as I got here, before he had fired a shot, before leading him\ninto a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque,\nthat to act in that way would have been almost impossible, for only\nafter I have faced his shot at the distance of twelve paces could my\nwords have any significance for him, and if I had spoken before, he\nwould have said, ‘He is a coward, the sight of the pistols has\nfrightened him, no use to listen to him.’ Gentlemen,” I cried suddenly,\nspeaking straight from my heart, “look around you at the gifts of God,\nthe clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is\nbeautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we\ndon’t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand\nthat and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall\nembrace each other and weep.”\n\nI would have said more but I could not; my voice broke with the\nsweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my\nheart as I had never known before in my life.\n\n“All this as rational and edifying,” said my antagonist, “and in any\ncase you are an original person.”\n\n“You may laugh,” I said to him, laughing too, “but afterwards you will\napprove of me.”\n\n“Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,” said he; “will you shake hands?\nfor I believe you are genuinely sincere.”\n\n“No,” I said, “not now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserve\nyour esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.”\n\nWe went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him.\nAll my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to\npass judgment on me the same day.\n\n“He has disgraced the uniform,” they said; “let him resign his\ncommission.”\n\nSome stood up for me: “He faced the shot,” they said.\n\n“Yes, but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness.”\n\n“If he had been afraid of being shot, he would have shot his own pistol\nfirst before asking forgiveness, while he flung it loaded into the\nforest. No, there’s something else in this, something original.”",
            "6": "I enjoyed listening and looking at them. “My dear friends and\ncomrades,” said I, “don’t worry about my resigning my commission, for I\nhave done so already. I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon\nas I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery—it’s with that object\nI am leaving the regiment.”\n\nWhen I had said this every one of them burst out laughing.\n\n“You should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we\ncan’t judge a monk.”\n\nThey laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but\nkindly and merrily. They all felt friendly to me at once, even those\nwho had been sternest in their censure, and all the following month,\nbefore my discharge came, they could not make enough of me. “Ah, you\nmonk,” they would say. And every one said something kind to me, they\nbegan trying to dissuade me, even to pity me: “What are you doing to\nyourself?”\n\n“No,” they would say, “he is a brave fellow, he faced fire and could\nhave fired his own pistol too, but he had a dream the night before that\nhe should become a monk, that’s why he did it.”\n\nIt was the same thing with the society of the town. Till then I had\nbeen kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention,\nand now all came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me,\nbut they loved me. I may mention that although everybody talked openly\nof our duel, the authorities took no notice of it, because my\nantagonist was a near relation of our general, and as there had been no\nbloodshed and no serious consequences, and as I resigned my commission,\nthey took it as a joke. And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly,\nregardless of their laughter, for it was always kindly and not spiteful\nlaughter. These conversations mostly took place in the evenings, in the\ncompany of ladies; women particularly liked listening to me then and\nthey made the men listen.\n\n“But how can I possibly be responsible for all?” every one would laugh\nin my face. “Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?”\n\n“You may well not know it,” I would answer, “since the whole world has\nlong been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies\nas truth and demand the same lies from others. Here I have for once in\nmy life acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman.\nThough you are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.”",
            "7": "“But how can we help being friendly to you?” said my hostess, laughing.\nThe room was full of people. All of a sudden the young lady rose, on\nwhose account the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had\nintended to be my future wife. I had not noticed her coming into the\nroom. She got up, came to me and held out her hand.\n\n“Let me tell you,” she said, “that I am the first not to laugh at you,\nbut on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for\nyou for your action then.”\n\nHer husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almost\nkissed me. My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was\nespecially caught by a middle‐aged man who came up to me with the\nothers. I knew him by name already, but had never made his acquaintance\nnor exchanged a word with him till that evening.\n\n_(d) The Mysterious Visitor_\n\n\nHe had long been an official in the town; he was in a prominent\nposition, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence.\nHe subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum;\nhe was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known\nafter his death. He was a man of about fifty, almost stern in\nappearance and not much given to conversation. He had been married\nabout ten years and his wife, who was still young, had borne him three\nchildren. Well, I was sitting alone in my room the following evening,\nwhen my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in.\n\nI must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my former\nquarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an old\nlady, the widow of a government clerk. My landlady’s servant waited\nupon me, for I had moved into her rooms simply because on my return\nfrom the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt\nashamed to look him in the face after my last interview with him. So\nprone is the man of the world to be ashamed of any righteous action.\n\n“I have,” said my visitor, “with great interest listened to you\nspeaking in different houses the last few days and I wanted at last to\nmake your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately.\nCan you, dear sir, grant me this favor?”",
            "8": "“I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an\nhonor.” I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I\nimpressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man. For\nthough other people had listened to me with interest and attention, no\none had come to me before with such a serious, stern and concentrated\nexpression. And now he had come to see me in my own rooms. He sat down.\n\n“You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,” he said; “as\nyou have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked\nincurring the contempt of all.”\n\n“Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,” I replied.\n\n“No, it’s not excessive,” he answered; “believe me, such a course of\naction is far more difficult than you think. It is that which has\nimpressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,”\nhe continued. “Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my\nperhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can\nrecall them, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask\nforgiveness at the duel. Do not think my question frivolous; on the\ncontrary, I have in asking the question a secret motive of my own,\nwhich I will perhaps explain to you later on, if it is God’s will that\nwe should become more intimately acquainted.”\n\nAll the while he was speaking, I was looking at him straight into the\nface and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity\non my side also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his\nsoul.\n\n“You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my\nopponent’s forgiveness,” I answered; “but I had better tell you from\nthe beginning what I have not yet told any one else.” And I described\nall that had passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to\nthe ground at his feet. “From that you can see for yourself,” I\nconcluded, “that at the time of the duel it was easier for me, for I\nhad made a beginning already at home, and when once I had started on\nthat road, to go farther along it was far from being difficult, but\nbecame a source of joy and happiness.”\n\nI liked the way he looked at me as he listened. “All that,” he said,\n“is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.”",
            "9": "And from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening. And we\nshould have become greater friends, if only he had ever talked of\nhimself. But about himself he scarcely ever said a word, yet\ncontinually asked me about myself. In spite of that I became very fond\nof him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all my feelings;\n“for,” thought I, “what need have I to know his secrets, since I can\nsee without that that he is a good man? Moreover, though he is such a\nserious man and my senior, he comes to see a youngster like me and\ntreats me as his equal.” And I learned a great deal that was profitable\nfrom him, for he was a man of lofty mind.\n\n“That life is heaven,” he said to me suddenly, “that I have long been\nthinking about”; and all at once he added, “I think of nothing else\nindeed.” He looked at me and smiled. “I am more convinced of it than\nyou are, I will tell you later why.”\n\nI listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me\nsomething.\n\n“Heaven,” he went on, “lies hidden within all of us—here it lies hidden\nin me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to‐morrow and\nfor all time.”\n\nI looked at him; he was speaking with great emotion and gazing\nmysteriously at me, as if he were questioning me.\n\n“And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own\nsins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how\nyou could comprehend it in all its significance at once. And in very\ntruth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be\nfor them not a dream, but a living reality.”\n\n“And when,” I cried out to him bitterly, “when will that come to pass?\nand will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?”",
            "10": "“What then, you don’t believe it,” he said. “You preach it and don’t\nbelieve it yourself. Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come\nto pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has\nits law. It’s a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the\nworld, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path\npsychologically. Until you have become really, in actual fact, a\nbrother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. No sort of\nscientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach men to\nshare property and privileges with equal consideration for all. Every\none will think his share too small and they will be always envying,\ncomplaining and attacking one another. You ask when it will come to\npass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through the period\nof isolation.”\n\n“What do you mean by isolation?” I asked him.",
            "11": "“Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age—it\nhas not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every\none strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to\nsecure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime\nall his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but\nself‐destruction, for instead of self‐realization he ends by arriving\nat complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units,\nthey all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof,\nhides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by\nbeing repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by\nhimself and thinks, ‘How strong I am now and how secure,’ and in his\nmadness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he\nsinks into self‐destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely\nupon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has\ntrained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in\nhumanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the\nprivileges that he has won for himself. Everywhere in these days men\nhave, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is\nto be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual\neffort. But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end,\nand all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated\nfrom one another. It will be the spirit of the time, and people will\nmarvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light.\nAnd then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens....\nBut, until then, we must keep the banner flying. Sometimes even if he\nhas to do it alone, and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set\nan example, and so draw men’s souls out of their solitude, and spur\nthem to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.”",
            "12": "Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and\nfervent talk. I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less\nfrequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. I say this, not as\nblame, for they still loved me and treated me good‐humoredly, but\nthere’s no denying that fashion is a great power in society. I began to\nregard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his\nintelligence, I began to perceive that he was brooding over some plan\nin his heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for a great deed.\nPerhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his secret, not seeking\nto discover it by direct question nor by insinuation. But I noticed at\nlast, that he seemed to show signs of wanting to tell me something.\nThis had become quite evident, indeed, about a month after he first\nbegan to visit me.\n\n“Do you know,” he said to me once, “that people are very inquisitive\nabout us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often. But let\nthem wonder, for _soon all will be explained_.”\n\nSometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him, and almost\nalways on such occasions he would get up and go away. Sometimes he\nwould fix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, “He will say\nsomething directly now.” But he would suddenly begin talking of\nsomething ordinary and familiar. He often complained of headache too.\n\nOne day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he had been talking with\ngreat fervor a long time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, and his face\nworked convulsively, while he stared persistently at me.\n\n“What’s the matter?” I said; “do you feel ill?”—he had just been\ncomplaining of headache.\n\n“I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.”\n\nHe said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. “Why is it he is\nsmiling?” The thought flashed through my mind before I realized\nanything else. I too turned pale.\n\n“What are you saying?” I cried.\n\n“You see,” he said, with a pale smile, “how much it has cost me to say\nthe first word. Now I have said it, I feel I’ve taken the first step\nand shall go on.”\n\nFor a long while I could not believe him, and I did not believe him at\nthat time, but only after he had been to see me three days running and\ntold me all about it. I thought he was mad, but ended by being\nconvinced, to my great grief and amazement. His crime was a great and\nterrible one.",
            "13": "Fourteen years before, he had murdered the widow of a landowner, a\nwealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in our town. He fell\npassionately in love with her, declared his feeling and tried to\npersuade her to marry him. But she had already given her heart to\nanother man, an officer of noble birth and high rank in the service,\nwho was at that time away at the front, though she was expecting him\nsoon to return. She refused his offer and begged him not to come and\nsee her. After he had ceased to visit her, he took advantage of his\nknowledge of the house to enter at night through the garden by the\nroof, at great risk of discovery. But, as often happens, a crime\ncommitted with extraordinary audacity is more successful than others.\n\nEntering the garret through the skylight, he went down the ladder,\nknowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the\nnegligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped to find it so, and\nso it was. He made his way in the dark to her bedroom, where a light\nwas burning. As though on purpose, both her maids had gone off to a\nbirthday‐party in the same street, without asking leave. The other\nservants slept in the servants’ quarters or in the kitchen on the\nground‐floor. His passion flamed up at the sight of her asleep, and\nthen vindictive, jealous anger took possession of his heart, and like a\ndrunken man, beside himself, he thrust a knife into her heart, so that\nshe did not even cry out. Then with devilish and criminal cunning he\ncontrived that suspicion should fall on the servants. He was so base as\nto take her purse, to open her chest with keys from under her pillow,\nand to take some things from it, doing it all as it might have been\ndone by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only\nmoney. He took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller\narticles that were ten times as valuable. He took with him, too, some\nthings for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done this\nawful deed, he returned by the way he had come.",
            "14": "Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after\nin his life, did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal.\nNo one indeed knew of his love for her, for he was always reserved and\nsilent and had no friend to whom he would have opened his heart. He was\nlooked upon simply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of\nthe murdered woman, as for the previous fortnight he had not even\nvisited her. A serf of hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and\nevery circumstance confirmed the suspicion. The man knew—indeed his\nmistress did not conceal the fact—that having to send one of her serfs\nas a recruit she had decided to send him, as he had no relations and\nhis conduct was unsatisfactory. People had heard him angrily\nthreatening to murder her when he was drunk in a tavern. Two days\nbefore her death, he had run away, staying no one knew where in the\ntown. The day after the murder, he was found on the road leading out of\nthe town, dead drunk, with a knife in his pocket, and his right hand\nhappened to be stained with blood. He declared that his nose had been\nbleeding, but no one believed him. The maids confessed that they had\ngone to a party and that the street‐door had been left open till they\nreturned. And a number of similar details came to light, throwing\nsuspicion on the innocent servant.\n\nThey arrested him, and he was tried for the murder; but a week after\nthe arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in\nthe hospital. There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities\nand every one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been\ncommitted by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital. And\nafter that the punishment began.\n\nMy mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he was not\nin the least troubled by pangs of conscience. He was miserable a long\ntime, but not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the\nwoman he loved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed\nhis love, while the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the\ninnocent blood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he\nscarcely thought. The thought that his victim might have become the\nwife of another man was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time,\nhe was convinced in his conscience that he could not have acted\notherwise.",
            "15": "At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness\nand death soon set his mind at rest, for the man’s death was apparently\n(so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright,\nbut a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all\nnight dead drunk on the damp ground. The theft of the money and other\nthings troubled him little, for he argued that the theft had not been\ncommitted for gain but to avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small,\nand he shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it, and much more,\ntowards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this\non purpose to set his conscience at rest about the theft, and it’s a\nremarkable fact that for a long time he really was at peace—he told me\nthis himself. He entered then upon a career of great activity in the\nservice, volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied\nhim two years, and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past.\nWhenever he recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became\nactive in philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many\ninstitutions in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in\nboth Moscow and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic\nsocieties.\n\nAt last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of it\nwas too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent\ngirl and soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his\nlonely depression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously\ndoing his duty to his wife and children, he would escape from old\nmemories altogether. But the very opposite of what he expected\nhappened. He began, even in the first month of his marriage, to be\ncontinually fretted by the thought, “My wife loves me—but what if she\nknew?” When she first told him that she would soon bear him a child, he\nwas troubled. “I am giving life, but I have taken life.” Children came.\n“How dare I love them, teach and educate them, how can I talk to them\nof virtue? I have shed blood.” They were splendid children, he longed\nto caress them; “and I can’t look at their innocent candid faces, I am\nunworthy.”",
            "16": "At last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of\nhis murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood\nthat cried out for vengeance. He had begun to have awful dreams. But,\nbeing a man of fortitude, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking:\n“I shall expiate everything by this secret agony.” But that hope, too,\nwas vain; the longer it went on, the more intense was his suffering.\n\nHe was respected in society for his active benevolence, though every\none was overawed by his stern and gloomy character. But the more he was\nrespected, the more intolerable it was for him. He confessed to me that\nhe had thoughts of killing himself. But he began to be haunted by\nanother idea—an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and\nunthinkable, though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he\ncould not shake it off. He dreamed of rising up, going out and\nconfessing in the face of all men that he had committed murder. For\nthree years this dream had pursued him, haunting him in different\nforms. At last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed\nhis crime, he would heal his soul and would be at peace for ever. But\nthis belief filled his heart with terror, for how could he carry it\nout? And then came what happened at my duel.\n\n“Looking at you, I have made up my mind.”\n\nI looked at him.\n\n“Is it possible,” I cried, clasping my hands, “that such a trivial\nincident could give rise to such a resolution in you?”\n\n“My resolution has been growing for the last three years,” he answered,\n“and your story only gave the last touch to it. Looking at you, I\nreproached myself and envied you.” He said this to me almost sullenly.\n\n“But you won’t be believed,” I observed; “it’s fourteen years ago.”\n\n“I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them.”\n\nThen I cried and kissed him.\n\n“Tell me one thing, one thing,” he said (as though it all depended upon\nme), “my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, and though my\nchildren won’t lose their rank and property, they’ll be a convict’s\nchildren and for ever! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall\nleave in their hearts!”\n\nI said nothing.\n\n“And to part from them, to leave them for ever? It’s for ever, you\nknow, for ever!”\n\nI sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt\nafraid.\n\n“Well?” He looked at me.\n\n“Go!” said I, “confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Your\nchildren will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of your\nresolution.”",
            "17": "He left me that time as though he had made up his mind. Yet for more\nthan a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still\npreparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the point. He made\nmy heart ache. One day he would come determined and say fervently:\n\n“I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess.\nFourteen years I’ve been in hell. I want to suffer. I will take my\npunishment and begin to live. You can pass through the world doing\nwrong, but there’s no turning back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor\neven my own children. Good God, my children will understand, perhaps,\nwhat my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me! God is not in\nstrength but in truth.”\n\n“All will understand your sacrifice,” I said to him, “if not at once,\nthey will understand later; for you have served truth, the higher\ntruth, not of the earth.”\n\nAnd he would go away seeming comforted, but next day he would come\nagain, bitter, pale, sarcastic.\n\n“Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though to\nsay, ‘He has still not confessed!’ Wait a bit, don’t despise me too\nmuch. It’s not such an easy thing to do, as you would think. Perhaps I\nshall not do it at all. You won’t go and inform against me then, will\nyou?”\n\nAnd far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid to\nlook at him at all. I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full\nof tears. I could not sleep at night.\n\n“I have just come from my wife,” he went on. “Do you understand what\nthe word ‘wife’ means? When I went out, the children called to me,\n‘Good‐by, father, make haste back to read _The Children’s Magazine_\nwith us.’ No, you don’t understand that! No one is wise from another\nman’s woe.”\n\nHis eyes were glittering, his lips were twitching. Suddenly he struck\nthe table with his fist so that everything on it danced—it was the\nfirst time he had done such a thing, he was such a mild man.\n\n“But need I?” he exclaimed, “must I? No one has been condemned, no one\nhas been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever. And I’ve\nbeen punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shan’t be\nbelieved, they won’t believe my proofs. Need I confess, need I? I am\nready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only\nmy wife and children may be spared. Will it be just to ruin them with\nme? Aren’t we making a mistake? What is right in this case? And will\npeople recognize it, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?”",
            "18": "“Good Lord!” I thought to myself, “he is thinking of other people’s\nrespect at such a moment!” And I felt so sorry for him then, that I\nbelieve I would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him. I\nsaw he was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as\nwell as my mind what such a resolution meant.\n\n“Decide my fate!” he exclaimed again.\n\n“Go and confess,” I whispered to him. My voice failed me, but I\nwhispered it firmly. I took up the New Testament from the table, the\nRussian translation, and showed him the Gospel of St. John, chapter\nxii. verse 24:\n\n“Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the\nground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much\nfruit.”\n\nI had just been reading that verse when he came in. He read it.\n\n“That’s true,” he said, but he smiled bitterly. “It’s terrible the\nthings you find in those books,” he said, after a pause. “It’s easy\nenough to thrust them upon one. And who wrote them? Can they have been\nwritten by men?”\n\n“The Holy Spirit wrote them,” said I.\n\n“It’s easy for you to prate,” he smiled again, this time almost with\nhatred.\n\nI took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31. He read:\n\n“It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”\n\nHe read it and simply flung down the book. He was trembling all over.\n\n“An awful text,” he said. “There’s no denying you’ve picked out fitting\nones.” He rose from the chair. “Well!” he said, “good‐by, perhaps I\nshan’t come again ... we shall meet in heaven. So I have been for\nfourteen years ‘in the hands of the living God,’ that’s how one must\nthink of those fourteen years. To‐morrow I will beseech those hands to\nlet me go.”\n\nI wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him, but I did not dare—his\nface was contorted and somber. He went away.\n\n“Good God,” I thought, “what has he gone to face!” I fell on my knees\nbefore the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God, our\nswift defender and helper. I was half an hour praying in tears, and it\nwas late, about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he came in\nagain. I was surprised.\n\n“Where have you been?” I asked him.\n\n“I think,” he said, “I’ve forgotten something ... my handkerchief, I\nthink.... Well, even if I’ve not forgotten anything, let me stay a\nlittle.”\n\nHe sat down. I stood over him.\n\n“You sit down, too,” said he.",
            "19": "I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he looked intently at me and\nsuddenly smiled—I remembered that—then he got up, embraced me warmly\nand kissed me.\n\n“Remember,” he said, “how I came to you a second time. Do you hear,\nremember it!”\n\nAnd he went out.\n\n“To‐morrow,” I thought.\n\nAnd so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was his\nbirthday. I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance\nof hearing it from any one. On that day he always had a great\ngathering, every one in the town went to it. It was the same this time.\nAfter dinner he walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his\nhand—a formal declaration to the chief of his department who was\npresent. This declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly. It\ncontained a full account of the crime, in every detail.\n\n“I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,” he said\nin conclusion. “I want to suffer for my sin!”\n\nThen he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been\nkeeping for fourteen years, that he thought would prove his crime, the\njewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert\nsuspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of\nher betrothed in the locket, her notebook and two letters; one from her\nbetrothed, telling her that he would soon be with her, and her\nunfinished answer left on the table to be sent off next day. He carried\noff these two letters—what for? Why had he kept them for fourteen years\nafterwards instead of destroying them as evidence against him?\n\nAnd this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every\none refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged, though all\nlistened with intense curiosity. A few days later it was fully decided\nand agreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal\nauthorities could not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped\nit. Though the trinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that\neven if they did turn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on\nthose alone. Besides, she might have given him those things as a\nfriend, or asked him to take care of them for her. I heard afterwards,\nhowever, that the genuineness of the things was proved by the friends\nand relations of the murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about\nthem. Yet nothing was destined to come of it, after all.",
            "20": "Five days later, all had heard that he was ill and that his life was in\ndanger. The nature of his illness I can’t explain, they said it was an\naffection of the heart. But it became known that the doctors had been\ninduced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also, and had\ncome to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity. I betrayed\nnothing, though people ran to question me. But when I wanted to visit\nhim, I was for a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his wife.\n\n“It’s you who have caused his illness,” she said to me; “he was always\ngloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarly\nexcited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him.\nYour preaching has brought him to this; for the last month he was\nalways with you.”\n\nIndeed, not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and\nblamed me. “It’s all your doing,” they said. I was silent and indeed\nrejoiced at heart, for I saw plainly God’s mercy to the man who had\nturned against himself and punished himself. I could not believe in his\ninsanity.\n\nThey let me see him at last, he insisted upon saying good‐by to me. I\nwent in to him and saw at once, that not only his days, but his hours\nwere numbered. He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for\nbreath, but his face was full of tender and happy feeling.\n\n“It is done!” he said. “I’ve long been yearning to see you, why didn’t\nyou come?”\n\nI did not tell him that they would not let me see him.\n\n“God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am\ndying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years.\nThere was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to\ndo. Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife\nnor the judges, nor any one has believed it. My children will never\nbelieve it either. I see in that God’s mercy to them. I shall die, and\nmy name will be without a stain for them. And now I feel God near, my\nheart rejoices as in Heaven ... I have done my duty.”\n\nHe could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly,\nlooking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept\npeeping in at us. But he had time to whisper to me:\n\n“Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight?\nI told you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to\nkill you!”\n\nI started.",
            "21": "“I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the\nstreets, struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I\ncould hardly bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he\nis my judge. I can’t refuse to face my punishment to‐morrow, for he\nknows all. It was not that I was afraid you would betray me (I never\neven thought of that), but I thought, ‘How can I look him in the face\nif I don’t confess?’ And if you had been at the other end of the earth,\nbut alive, it would have been all the same, the thought was unendurable\nthat you were alive knowing everything and condemning me. I hated you\nas though you were the cause, as though you were to blame for\neverything. I came back to you then, remembering that you had a dagger\nlying on your table. I sat down and asked you to sit down, and for a\nwhole minute I pondered. If I had killed you, I should have been ruined\nby that murder even if I had not confessed the other. But I didn’t\nthink about that at all, and I didn’t want to think of it at that\nmoment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myself on you for\neverything. The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let me tell\nyou, you were never nearer death.”\n\nA week later he died. The whole town followed him to the grave. The\nchief priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible\nillness that had cut short his days. But all the town was up in arms\nagainst me after the funeral, and people even refused to see me. Some,\nat first a few and afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the\ntruth of his story, and they visited me and questioned me with great\ninterest and eagerness, for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace\nof the righteous. But I held my tongue, and very shortly after, I left\nthe town, and five months later by God’s grace I entered upon the safe\nand blessed path, praising the unseen finger which had guided me so\nclearly to it. But I remember in my prayer to this day, the servant of\nGod, Mihail, who suffered so greatly."

            "0": "_(e) The Russian Monk and his possible Significance_\n\n\nFathers and teachers, what is the monk? In the cultivated world the\nword is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others\nit is used as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is\ngrowing. It is true, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards,\ngluttons, profligates and insolent beggars among monks. Educated people\npoint to these: “You are idlers, useless members of society, you live\non the labor of others, you are shameless beggars.” And yet how many\nmeek and humble monks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent\nprayer in peace! These are less noticed, or passed over in silence. And\nhow surprised men would be if I were to say that from these meek monks,\nwho yearn for solitary prayer, the salvation of Russia will come\nperhaps once more! For they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet\n“for the day and the hour, the month and the year.” Meanwhile, in their\nsolitude, they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled, in the\npurity of God’s truth, from the times of the Fathers of old, the\nApostles and the martyrs. And when the time comes they will show it to\nthe tottering creeds of the world. That is a great thought. That star\nwill rise out of the East.\n\nThat is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at\nthe worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has\nnot God’s image and His truth been distorted in them? They have\nscience; but in science there is nothing but what is the object of\nsense. The spiritual world, the higher part of man’s being is rejected\naltogether, dismissed with a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The\nworld has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late, but what\ndo we see in this freedom of theirs? Nothing but slavery and\nself‐destruction! For the world says:\n\n“You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as\nthe most rich and powerful. Don’t be afraid of satisfying them and even\nmultiply your desires.” That is the modern doctrine of the world. In\nthat they see freedom. And what follows from this right of\nmultiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual\nsuicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights,\nbut have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants. They\nmaintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more\nbound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and\nsets thoughts flying through the air.",
            "1": "Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. Interpreting freedom as the\nmultiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their own\nnature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and\nridiculous fancies are fostered in them. They live only for mutual\nenvy, for luxury and ostentation. To have dinners, visits, carriages,\nrank and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which\nlife, honor and human feeling are sacrificed, and men even commit\nsuicide if they are unable to satisfy it. We see the same thing among\nthose who are not rich, while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and\ntheir envy in drunkenness. But soon they will drink blood instead of\nwine, they are being led on to it. I ask you is such a man free? I knew\none “champion of freedom” who told me himself that, when he was\ndeprived of tobacco in prison, he was so wretched at the privation that\nhe almost went and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting tobacco\nagain! And such a man says, “I am fighting for the cause of humanity.”\n\nHow can such a one fight? what is he fit for? He is capable perhaps of\nsome action quickly over, but he cannot hold out long. And it’s no\nwonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and\ninstead of serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of\nhumanity have fallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation,\nas my mysterious visitor and teacher said to me in my youth. And\ntherefore the idea of the service of humanity, of brotherly love and\nthe solidarity of mankind, is more and more dying out in the world, and\nindeed this idea is sometimes treated with derision. For how can a man\nshake off his habits? What can become of him if he is in such bondage\nto the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for\nhimself? He is isolated, and what concern has he with the rest of\nhumanity? They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of\nobjects, but the joy in the world has grown less.",
            "2": "The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer are\nlaughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom. I\ncut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and\nwanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God’s help I\nattain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most\ncapable of conceiving a great idea and serving it—the rich man in his\nisolation or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material\nthings and habits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, “You have\nsecluded yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own\nsalvation, and have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!” But\nwe shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love.\nFor it is not we, but they, who are in isolation, though they don’t see\nthat. Of old, leaders of the people came from among us, and why should\nthey not again? The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go\nout to work for the great cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the\npeople. And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people.\nWe are isolated only if the people are isolated. The people believe as\nwe do, and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in Russia,\neven if he is sincere in heart and a genius. Remember that! The people\nwill meet the atheist and overcome him, and Russia will be one and\northodox. Take care of the peasant and guard his heart. Go on educating\nhim quietly. That’s your duty as monks, for the peasant has God in his\nheart.\n\n(_f_) _Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them\nto be Brothers in the Spirit_",
            "3": "\nOf course, I don’t deny that there is sin in the peasants too. And the\nfire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from above\ndownwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.\nMoney‐ lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. Already the\nmerchant grows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show\nhimself cultured though he has not a trace of culture, and to this end\nmeanly despises his old traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of\nhis fathers. He visits princes, though he is only a peasant corrupted.\nThe peasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit.\nAnd what cruelty to their wives, to their children even! All from\ndrunkenness! I’ve seen in the factories children of nine years old,\nfrail, rickety, bent and already depraved. The stuffy workshop, the din\nof machinery, work all day long, the vile language and the drink, the\ndrink—is that what a little child’s heart needs? He needs sunshine,\nchildish play, good examples all about him, and at least a little love.\nThere must be no more of this, monks, no more torturing of children,\nrise up and preach that, make haste, make haste!\n\nBut God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and\ncannot renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and\nthat they do wrong in sinning. So that our people still believe in\nrighteousness, have faith in God and weep tears of devotion.\n\nIt is different with the upper classes. They, following science, want\nto base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and\nthey have already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no\nsin. And that’s consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning\nof crime? In Europe the people are already rising up against the rich\nwith violence, and the leaders of the people are everywhere leading\nthem to bloodshed, and teaching them that their wrath is righteous. But\ntheir “wrath is accursed, for it is cruel.” But God will save Russia as\nHe has saved her many times. Salvation will come from the people, from\ntheir faith and their meekness.",
            "4": "Fathers and teachers, watch over the people’s faith and this will not\nbe a dream. I’ve been struck all my life in our great people by their\ndignity, their true and seemly dignity. I’ve seen it myself, I can\ntestify to it, I’ve seen it and marveled at it, I’ve seen it in spite\nof the degraded sins and poverty‐stricken appearance of our peasantry.\nThey are not servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are\nfree in manner and bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful\nand not envious. “You are rich and noble, you are clever and talented,\nwell, be so, God bless you. I respect you, but I know that I too am a\nman. By the very fact that I respect you without envy I prove my\ndignity as a man.”\n\nIn truth if they don’t say this (for they don’t know how to say this\nyet), that is how they act. I have seen it myself, I have known it\nmyself, and, would you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is,\nthe more noticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them\nare for the most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our\ncarelessness and indifference. But God will save His people, for Russia\nis great in her humility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly\nalready, our future. It will come to pass, that even the most corrupt\nof our rich will end by being ashamed of his riches before the poor,\nand the poor, seeing his humility, will understand and give way before\nhim, will respond joyfully and kindly to his honorable shame. Believe\nme that it will end in that; things are moving to that. Equality is to\nbe found only in the spiritual dignity of man, and that will only be\nunderstood among us. If we were brothers, there would be fraternity,\nbut before that, they will never agree about the division of wealth. We\npreserve the image of Christ, and it will shine forth like a precious\ndiamond to the whole world. So may it be, so may it be!\n\nFathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my\nwanderings I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy. It was\neight years since I had parted from him. He chanced to see me in the\nmarket‐place, recognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he was! He\nsimply pounced on me: “Master dear, is it you? Is it really you I see?”\nHe took me home with him.",
            "5": "He was no longer in the army, he was married and already had two little\nchildren. He and his wife earned their living as costermongers in the\nmarket‐place. His room was poor, but bright and clean. He made me sit\ndown, set the samovar, sent for his wife, as though my appearance were\na festival for them. He brought me his children: “Bless them, Father.”\n\n“Is it for me to bless them? I am only a humble monk. I will pray for\nthem. And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since\nthat day, for it all came from you,” said I. And I explained that to\nhim as well as I could. And what do you think? The man kept gazing at\nme and could not believe that I, his former master, an officer, was now\nbefore him in such a guise and position; it made him shed tears.\n\n“Why are you weeping?” said I, “better rejoice over me, dear friend,\nwhom I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.”\n\nHe did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his head over me\ntenderly.\n\n“What has became of your fortune?” he asked.\n\n“I gave it to the monastery,” I answered; “we live in common.”\n\nAfter tea I began saying good‐by, and suddenly he brought out half a\nrouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half‐rouble I saw\nhim thrusting hurriedly into my hand: “That’s for you in your\nwanderings, it may be of use to you, Father.”\n\nI took his half‐rouble, bowed to him and his wife, and went out\nrejoicing. And on my way I thought: “Here we are both now, he at home\nand I on the road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet\nsmiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts, remembering how God\nbrought about our meeting.”\n\nI have never seen him again since then. I had been his master and he my\nservant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts,\nthere was a great human bond between us. I have thought a great deal\nabout that, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that\nthat grand and simple‐hearted unity might in due time become universal\namong the Russian people? I believe that it will come to pass and that\nthe time is at hand.",
            "6": "And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young I was\noften angry with servants; “the cook had served something too hot, the\norderly had not brushed my clothes.” But what taught me better then was\na thought of my dear brother’s, which I had heard from him in\nchildhood: “Am I worth it, that another should serve me and be ordered\nabout by me in his poverty and ignorance?” And I wondered at the time\nthat such simple and self‐ evident ideas should be so slow to occur to\nour minds.\n\nIt is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act\nso that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a\nservant. And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him\nsee it, and that without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his?\nWhy should not my servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take\nhim into my family and rejoice in doing so? Even now this can be done,\nbut it will lead to the grand unity of men in the future, when a man\nwill not seek servants for himself, or desire to turn his fellow\ncreatures into servants as he does now, but on the contrary, will long\nwith his whole heart to be the servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.\n\nAnd can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy only in\ndeeds of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in\ngluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one\nwith the other? I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at\nhand. People laugh and ask: “When will that time come and does it look\nlike coming?” I believe that with Christ’s help we shall accomplish\nthis great thing. And how many ideas there have been on earth in the\nhistory of man which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared!\nYet when their destined hour had come, they came forth and spread over\nthe whole earth. So it will be with us, and our people will shine forth\nin the world, and all men will say: “The stone which the builders\nrejected has become the corner‐stone of the building.”",
            "7": "And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when\nwill you build up your edifice and order things justly by your\nintellect alone, without Christ? If they declare that it is they who\nare advancing towards unity, only the most simple‐hearted among them\nbelieve it, so that one may positively marvel at such simplicity. Of a\ntruth, they have more fantastic dreams than we. They aim at justice,\nbut, denying Christ, they will end by flooding the earth with blood,\nfor blood cries out for blood, and he that taketh up the sword shall\nperish by the sword. And if it were not for Christ’s covenant, they\nwould slaughter one another down to the last two men on earth. And\nthose two last men would not be able to restrain each other in their\npride, and the one would slay the other and then himself. And that\nwould come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that for the\nsake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.\n\nWhile I was still wearing an officer’s uniform after my duel, I talked\nabout servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed\nat me. “What!” they asked, “are we to make our servants sit down on the\nsofa and offer them tea?” And I answered them: “Why not, sometimes at\nleast?” Every one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer\nwas not clear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.\n\n(_g_) _Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds_",
            "8": "\nYoung man, be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your\nprayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it,\nwhich will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer\nis an education. Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat\nto yourself, “Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to‐day.”\nFor every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this\nearth, and their souls appear before God. And how many of them depart\nin solitude, unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even\nknows whether they have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of\nthe earth perhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God\nthough you knew them not nor they you. How touching it must be to a\nsoul standing in dread before the Lord to feel at that instant that,\nfor him too, there is one to pray, that there is a fellow creature left\non earth to love him too! And God will look on you both more\ngraciously, for if you have had so much pity on him, how much will He\nhave pity Who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you! And He\nwill forgive him for your sake.",
            "9": "Brothers, have no fear of men’s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for\nthat is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth.\nLove all God’s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love\nevery leaf, every ray of God’s light. Love the animals, love the\nplants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the\ndivine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to\ncomprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the\nwhole world with an all‐ embracing love. Love the animals: God has\ngiven them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Do not trouble\nit, don’t harass them, don’t deprive them of their happiness, don’t\nwork against God’s intent. Man, do not pride yourself on superiority to\nthe animals; they are without sin, and you, with your greatness, defile\nthe earth by your appearance on it, and leave the traces of your\nfoulness after you—alas, it is true of almost every one of us! Love\nchildren especially, for they too are sinless like the angels; they\nlive to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to guide us. Woe to\nhim who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love children. The\nkind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the farthings\ngiven us on sweets and cakes for the children. He could not pass by a\nchild without emotion. That’s the nature of the man.\n\nAt some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men’s\nsin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love. Always\ndecide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may\nsubdue the whole world. Loving humility is marvelously strong, the\nstrongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it.",
            "10": "Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watch\nyourself, and see that your image is a seemly one. You pass by a little\nchild, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you\nmay not have noticed the child, but he has seen you, and your image,\nunseemly and ignoble, may remain in his defenseless heart. You don’t\nknow it, but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow, and\nall because you were not careful before the child, because you did not\nfoster in yourself a careful, actively benevolent love. Brothers, love\nis a teacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to\nacquire, it is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor. For we\nmust love not only occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one\ncan love occasionally, even the wicked can.\n\nMy brother asked the birds to forgive him; that sounds senseless, but\nit is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a\ntouch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth. It\nmay be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be\nhappier at your side—a little happier, anyway—and children and all\nanimals, if you were nobler than you are now. It’s all like an ocean, I\ntell you. Then you would pray to the birds too, consumed by an\nall‐embracing love, in a sort of transport, and pray that they too will\nforgive you your sin. Treasure this ecstasy, however senseless it may\nseem to men.\n\nMy friends, pray to God for gladness. Be glad as children, as the birds\nof heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings. Fear\nnot that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished.\nDo not say, “Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is\nmighty, and we are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing\nus away and hindering our good work from being done.” Fly from that\ndejection, children! There is only one means of salvation, then take\nyourself and make yourself responsible for all men’s sins, that is the\ntruth, you know, friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself\nresponsible for everything and for all men, you will see at once that\nit is really so, and that you are to blame for every one and for all\nthings. But throwing your own indolence and impotence on others you\nwill end by sharing the pride of Satan and murmuring against God.",
            "11": "Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth\nto comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to\nshare it, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine.\nIndeed, many of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we\ncannot comprehend on earth. Let not that be a stumbling‐block, and\nthink not that it may serve as a justification to you for anything. For\nthe Eternal Judge asks of you what you can comprehend and not what you\ncannot. You will know that yourself hereafter, for you will behold all\nthings truly then and will not dispute them. On earth, indeed, we are\nas it were astray, and if it were not for the precious image of Christ\nbefore us, we should be undone and altogether lost, as was the human\nrace before the flood. Much on earth is hidden from us, but to make up\nfor that we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond\nwith the other world, with the higher heavenly world, and the roots of\nour thoughts and feelings are not here but in other worlds. That is why\nthe philosophers say that we cannot apprehend the reality of things on\nearth.\n\nGod took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and\nHis garden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what\ngrows lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with\nother mysterious worlds. If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in\nyou, the heavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be\nindifferent to life and even grow to hate it. That’s what I think.\n\n_(h) Can a Man judge his Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End_",
            "12": "\nRemember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one. For no one\ncan judge a criminal, until he recognizes that he is just such a\ncriminal as the man standing before him, and that he perhaps is more\nthan all men to blame for that crime. When he understands that, he will\nbe able to be a judge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had\nbeen righteous myself, perhaps there would have been no criminal\nstanding before me. If you can take upon yourself the crime of the\ncriminal your heart is judging, take it at once, suffer for him\nyourself, and let him go without reproach. And even if the law itself\nmakes you his judge, act in the same spirit so far as possible, for he\nwill go away and condemn himself more bitterly than you have done. If,\nafter your kiss, he goes away untouched, mocking at you, do not let\nthat be a stumbling‐block to you. It shows his time has not yet come,\nbut it will come in due course. And if it come not, no matter; if not\nhe, then another in his place will understand and suffer, and judge and\ncondemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled. Believe that, believe\nit without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and faith of the\nsaints.\n\nWork without ceasing. If you remember in the night as you go to sleep,\n“I have not done what I ought to have done,” rise up at once and do it.\nIf the people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear\nyou, fall down before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you\nare to blame for their not wanting to hear you. And if you cannot speak\nto them in their bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility,\nnever losing hope. If all men abandon you and even drive you away by\nforce, then when you are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it,\nwater it with your tears and it will bring forth fruit even though no\none has seen or heard you in your solitude. Believe to the end, even if\nall men went astray and you were left the only one faithful; bring your\noffering even then and praise God in your loneliness. And if two of you\nare gathered together—then there is a whole world, a world of living\nlove. Embrace each other tenderly and praise God, for if only in you\ntwo His truth has been fulfilled.\n\nIf you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for\nyour sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous\nman, rejoice that if you have sinned, he is righteous and has not\nsinned.",
            "13": "If the evil‐doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming\ndistress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil‐doers, shun above\nall things that feeling. Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as\nthough you were yourself guilty of that wrong. Accept that suffering\nand bear it and your heart will find comfort, and you will understand\nthat you too are guilty, for you might have been a light to the\nevil‐doers, even as the one man sinless, and you were not a light to\nthem. If you had been a light, you would have lightened the path for\nothers too, and the evil‐doer might perhaps have been saved by your\nlight from his sin. And even though your light was shining, yet you see\nmen were not saved by it, hold firm and doubt not the power of the\nheavenly light. Believe that if they were not saved, they will be saved\nhereafter. And if they are not saved hereafter, then their sons will be\nsaved, for your light will not die even when you are dead. The\nrighteous man departs, but his light remains. Men are always saved\nafter the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay\nthem, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.\nYou are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Seek no\nreward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which\nis only vouchsafed to the righteous man. Fear not the great nor the\nmighty, but be wise and ever serene. Know the measure, know the times,\nstudy that. When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on\nthe earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing,\nconsuming love. Love all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and\necstasy. Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those\ntears. Don’t be ashamed of that ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of\nGod and a great one; it is not given to many but only to the elect.\n\n_(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_",
            "14": "\nFathers and teachers, I ponder, “What is hell?” I maintain that it is\nthe suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence,\nimmeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his\ncoming to earth, the power of saying, “I am and I love.” Once, only\nonce, there was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for\nthat was earthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And\nthat happy creature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it\nnot, scorned it and remained callous. Such a one, having left the\nearth, sees Abraham’s bosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in\nthe parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go\nup to the Lord. But that is just his torment, to rise up to the Lord\nwithout ever having loved, to be brought close to those who have loved\nwhen he has despised their love. For he sees clearly and says to\nhimself, “Now I have understanding, and though I now thirst to love,\nthere will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my love, for my earthly\nlife is over, and Abraham will not come even with a drop of living\nwater (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the fiery\nthirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it on\nearth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time! Even\nthough I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for\nthat life is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is\na gulf fixed between that life and this existence.”",
            "15": "They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don’t go into that\nmystery and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material\nsense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony,\ntheir still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment.\nMoreover, that spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that\nsuffering is not external but within them. And if it could be taken\nfrom them, I think it would be bitterer still for the unhappy\ncreatures. For even if the righteous in Paradise forgave them,\nbeholding their torments, and called them up to heaven in their\ninfinite love, they would only multiply their torments, for they would\narouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive,\nactive and grateful love which is now impossible. In the timidity of my\nheart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of this\nimpossibility would serve at last to console them. For accepting the\nlove of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it,\nby this submissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will\nattain at last, as it were, to a certain semblance of that active love\nwhich they scorned in life, to something like its outward\nexpression.... I am sorry, friends and brothers, that I cannot express\nthis clearly. But woe to those who have slain themselves on earth, woe\nto the suicides! I believe that there can be none more miserable than\nthey. They tell us that it is a sin to pray for them and outwardly the\nChurch, as it were, renounces them, but in my secret heart I believe\nthat we may pray even for them. Love can never be an offense to Christ.\nFor such as those I have prayed inwardly all my life, I confess it,\nfathers and teachers, and even now I pray for them every day.",
            "16": "Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite\nof their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth;\nthere are some fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and\nhis proud spirit entirely. For such, hell is voluntary and ever\nconsuming; they are tortured by their own choice. For they have cursed\nthemselves, cursing God and life. They live upon their vindictive pride\nlike a starving man in the desert sucking blood out of his own body.\nBut they are never satisfied, and they refuse forgiveness, they curse\nGod Who calls them. They cannot behold the living God without hatred,\nand they cry out that the God of life should be annihilated, that God\nshould destroy Himself and His own creation. And they will burn in the\nfire of their own wrath for ever and yearn for death and annihilation.\nBut they will not attain to death....\n\n\nHere Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov’s manuscript ends. I repeat, it is\nincomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover\nonly Father Zossima’s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we\nfind brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different\noccasions. His utterances during the last few hours have not been kept\nseparate from the rest, but their general character can be gathered\nfrom what we have in Alexey Fyodorovitch’s manuscript.\n\nThe elder’s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although\nthose who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his\ndeath was approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would\ncome so suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already,\nseeing him that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were\nconvinced that there was at least a temporary change for the better in\nhis condition. Even five minutes before his death, they said afterwards\nwonderingly, it was impossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to\nfeel an acute pain in his chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands\nto his heart. All rose from their seats and hastened to him. But though\nsuffering, he still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from his\nchair on to his knees, then bowed his face to the ground, stretched out\nhis arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and kissing the\nground, quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to God.",
            "17": "The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached\nthe monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty\nit was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the\nancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church.

But this subject will be treated in the next\nbook; I will only add here that before a day had passed something\nhappened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its\neffect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years,\nthat day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\n\nBook VII.

            "0": "The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the\nestablished ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and\nhermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: “If any one\nof the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose\noffice it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the\nsign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the\nbreast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.”\nAll this was done by Father Païssy, who then clothed the deceased in\nhis monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to\ncustom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the\nform of a cross. On his head he put a hood with an eight‐cornered\ncross. The hood was left open and the dead man’s face was covered with\nblack gauze. In his hands was put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards\nmorning he was put in the coffin which had been made ready long before.\nIt was decided to leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger\nroom in which the elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks.\nAs the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the\nGospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks in holy\norders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the\nrequiem service. Father Païssy desired later on to read the Gospel all\nday and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as\nthe Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied,\nfor something extraordinary, an unheard‐of, even “unseemly” excitement\nand impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the\nvisitors from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking\nfrom the town. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked.\nBoth the Superintendent and Father Païssy did their utmost to calm the\ngeneral bustle and agitation.\n\nWhen it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in\nmost cases children, with them from the town—as though they had been\nwaiting expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that\nthe dead elder’s remains had a power of healing, which would be\nimmediately made manifest in accordance with their faith. It was only\nthen apparent how unquestionably every one in our town had accepted\nFather Zossima during his lifetime as a great saint. And those who came\nwere far from being all of the humbler classes.",
            "1": "This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such\nhaste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence,\nimpressed Father Païssy as unseemly. Though he had long foreseen\nsomething of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was\nbeyond anything he had looked for. When he came across any of the monks\nwho displayed this excitement, Father Païssy began to reprove them.\n“Such immediate expectation of something extraordinary,” he said,\n“shows a levity, possible to worldly people but unseemly in us.”\n\nBut little attention was paid him and Father Païssy noticed it\nuneasily. Yet he himself (if the whole truth must be told), secretly at\nthe bottom of his heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not\nbut be aware of it, though he was indignant at the too impatient\nexpectation around him, and saw in it light‐mindedness and vanity.\nNevertheless, it was particularly unpleasant to him to meet certain\npersons, whose presence aroused in him great misgivings. In the crowd\nin the dead man’s cell he noticed with inward aversion (for which he\nimmediately reproached himself) the presence of Rakitin and of the monk\nfrom Obdorsk, who was still staying in the monastery. Of both of them\nFather Païssy felt for some reason suddenly suspicious—though, indeed,\nhe might well have felt the same about others.\n\nThe monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited\ncrowd. He was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he was asking\nquestions, everywhere he was listening, on all sides he was whispering\nwith a peculiar, mysterious air. His expression showed the greatest\nimpatience and even a sort of irritation.\n\nAs for Rakitin, he, as appeared later, had come so early to the\nhermitage at the special request of Madame Hohlakov. As soon as that\ngood‐hearted but weak‐minded woman, who could not herself have been\nadmitted to the hermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father\nZossima, she was overtaken with such intense curiosity that she\npromptly dispatched Rakitin to the hermitage, to keep a careful look\nout and report to her by letter every half‐hour or so “_everything that\ntakes place_.” She regarded Rakitin as a most religious and devout\nyoung man. He was particularly clever in getting round people and\nassuming whatever part he thought most to their taste, if he detected\nthe slightest advantage to himself from doing so.",
            "2": "It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging\nabout the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and\nscattered here and there about the hermitage. As he walked round the\nhermitage, Father Païssy remembered Alyosha and that he had not seen\nhim for some time, not since the night. And he had no sooner thought of\nhim than he at once noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage\ngarden, sitting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago\nfor his saintliness. He sat with his back to the hermitage and his face\nto the wall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone. Going up to\nhim, Father Païssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly, with\nhis face hidden in his hands, and that his whole frame was shaking with\nsobs. Father Païssy stood over him for a little.\n\n“Enough, dear son, enough, dear,” he pronounced with feeling at last.\n“Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don’t you know that this is the\ngreatest of his days? Think only where he is now, at this moment!”\n\nAlyosha glanced at him, uncovering his face, which was swollen with\ncrying like a child’s, but turned away at once without uttering a word\nand hid his face in his hands again.\n\n“Maybe it is well,” said Father Païssy thoughtfully; “weep if you must,\nChrist has sent you those tears.”\n\n“Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to\ngladden your dear heart,” he added to himself, walking away from\nAlyosha, and thinking lovingly of him. He moved away quickly, however,\nfor he felt that he too might weep looking at him.",
            "3": "Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems\nfor the dead followed in their due course. Father Païssy again took\nFather Iosif’s place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. But\nbefore three o’clock in the afternoon that something took place to\nwhich I alluded at the end of the last book, something so unexpected by\nall of us and so contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this\ntrivial incident has been minutely remembered to this day in our town\nand all the surrounding neighborhood. I may add here, for myself\npersonally, that I feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which\ncaused such frivolous agitation and was such a stumbling‐block to many,\nthough in reality it was the most natural and trivial matter. I should,\nof course, have omitted all mention of it in my story, if it had not\nexerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief,\nthough future, hero of my story, Alyosha, forming a crisis and\nturning‐point in his spiritual development, giving a shock to his\nintellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and\ngave it a definite aim.\n\nAnd so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father\nZossima’s body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the\nquestion of opening the windows was raised among those who were around\nthe coffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was\nunanswered and almost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have\ninwardly noticed it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and\ncorruption from the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity,\ncalling for compassion (if not a smile) for the lack of faith and the\nfrivolity it implied. For they expected something quite different.",
            "4": "And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first\nonly observed in silence by those who came in and out and were\nevidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by\nthree o’clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that\nthe news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage,\npromptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into\namazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the\ntown, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike. The\nunbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of them rejoiced\neven more than the unbelievers, for “men love the downfall and disgrace\nof the righteous,” as the deceased elder had said in one of his\nexhortations.\n\nThe fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the\ncoffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o’clock it was\nquite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such\nscandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a\nscandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder\nimmediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves.\nAfterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed\nand horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have\nreached such proportions. For in the past, monks of very holy life had\ndied, God‐fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all,\nyet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come,\nnaturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor\neven the slightest excitement. Of course there had been, in former\ntimes, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and\nwhose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption.\nThis fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the\ntradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and\nas a promise, by God’s grace, of still greater glory from their tombs\nin the future.",
            "5": "One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk,\nJob, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and\nfive. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence,\nand his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with\npeculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it.\n(That was the very tomb on which Father Païssy had found Alyosha\nsitting in the morning.) Another memory cherished in the monastery was\nthat of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had\npreceded Father Zossima in the eldership. He was reverenced during his\nlifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There\nwas a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though\nalive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were\nburied and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And some\npeople even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies.\n\nYet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to\nexplain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside\nthe coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several\ndifferent causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the\ndeeply‐rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious\ninnovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the\nmonks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man’s saintliness,\nso firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a\nforbidden thing to question it. For though the late elder had won over\nmany hearts, more by love than by miracles, and had gathered round him\na mass of loving adherents, none the less, in fact, rather the more on\nthat account he had awakened jealousy and so had come to have bitter\nenemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery but in the world\noutside it. He did no one any harm, but “Why do they think him so\nsaintly?” And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at\nlast to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was why\nmany people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition\nwhich came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the\nsame time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently\ndevoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally\naffronted by this incident. This was how the thing happened.",
            "6": "As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect\nof the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They\nwent in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to\nthe crowd of other monks waiting outside. Some of the latter shook\ntheir heads mournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the\ndelight which gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes. And now no\none reproached them for it, no one raised his voice in protest, which\nwas strange, for the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead\nelder. But it seemed as though God had in this case let the minority\nget the upper hand for a time.\n\nVisitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went\ninto the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few\nwent into the cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of\nthe hermitage. After three o’clock the rush of worldly visitors was\ngreatly increased and this was no doubt owing to the shocking news.\nPeople were attracted who would not otherwise have come on that day and\nhad not intended to come, and among them were some personages of high\nstanding. But external decorum was still preserved and Father Païssy,\nwith a stern face, continued firmly and distinctly reading aloud the\nGospel, apparently not noticing what was taking place around him,\nthough he had, in fact, observed something unusual long before. But at\nlast the murmurs, first subdued but gradually louder and more\nconfident, reached even him. “It shows God’s judgment is not as man’s,”\nFather Païssy heard suddenly. The first to give utterance to this\nsentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known to be\na man of great piety. But he only repeated aloud what the monks had\nlong been whispering. They had long before formulated this damning\nconclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant\nsatisfaction at that conclusion became more and more apparent every\nmoment. Soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and almost\nseemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it.\n\n“And for what reason can _this_ have happened,” some of the monks said,\nat first with a show of regret; “he had a small frame and his flesh was\ndried up on his bones, what was there to decay?”",
            "7": "“It must be a sign from heaven,” others hastened to add, and their\nopinion was adopted at once without protest. For it was pointed out,\ntoo, that if the decomposition had been natural, as in the case of\nevery dead sinner, it would have been apparent later, after a lapse of\nat least twenty‐four hours, but this premature corruption “was in\nexcess of nature,” and so the finger of God was evident. It was meant\nfor a sign. This conclusion seemed irresistible.\n\nGentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man’s,\ntried to reply to some of the evil speakers that “this is not held\neverywhere alike,” and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the\njust was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and\nthat even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they\nwere not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the\nchief sign of the glorification of the saved was not bodily\nincorruptibility, but the color of the bones when the bodies have lain\nmany years in the earth and have decayed in it. “And if the bones are\nyellow as wax, that is the great sign that the Lord has glorified the\ndead saint, if they are not yellow but black, it shows that God has not\ndeemed him worthy of such glory—that is the belief in Athos, a great\nplace, where the Orthodox doctrine has been preserved from of old,\nunbroken and in its greatest purity,” said Father Iosif in conclusion.\n\nBut the meek Father’s words had little effect and even provoked a\nmocking retort. “That’s all pedantry and innovation, no use listening\nto it,” the monks decided. “We stick to the old doctrine, there are all\nsorts of innovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?” added\nothers.\n\n“We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the\nTurks, they have forgotten everything. Their doctrine has long been\nimpure and they have no bells even,” the most sneering added.",
            "8": "Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he had put forward\nhis own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in\nit himself. He foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was\nbeginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience. Little by\nlittle, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father\nIosif. And so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had\naccepted with devout obedience the institution of the eldership were\nall at once terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another’s\nfaces, when they met. Those who were hostile to the institution of\nelders, as a novelty, held up their heads proudly. “There was no smell\nof corruption from the late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,”\nthey recalled malignantly. “But he gained that glory not because he was\nan elder, but because he was a holy man.”\n\nAnd this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father\nZossima. “His teaching was false; he taught that life is a great joy\nand not a vale of tears,” said some of the more unreasonable. “He\nfollowed the fashionable belief, he did not recognize material fire in\nhell,” others, still more unreasonable, added. “He was not strict in\nfasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea,\nladies used to send it to him. Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink\ntea?” could be heard among some of the envious. “He sat in pride,” the\nmost malignant declared vindictively; “he considered himself a saint\nand he took it as his due when people knelt before him.” “He abused the\nsacrament of confession,” the fiercest opponents of the institution of\nelders added in a malicious whisper. And among these were some of the\noldest monks, strictest in their devotion, genuine ascetics, who had\nkept silent during the life of the deceased elder, but now suddenly\nunsealed their lips. And this was terrible, for their words had great\ninfluence on young monks who were not yet firm in their convictions.\nThe monk from Obdorsk heard all this attentively, heaving deep sighs\nand nodding his head. “Yes, clearly Father Ferapont was right in his\njudgment yesterday,” and at that moment Father Ferapont himself made\nhis appearance, as though on purpose to increase the confusion.",
            "9": "I have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the\napiary. He was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this\nneglect on the ground of his craziness, and did not keep him to the\nrules binding on all the rest. But if the whole truth is to be told,\nthey hardly had a choice about it. For it would have been discreditable\nto insist on burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic,\nwho prayed day and night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they\nhad insisted, the monks would have said, “He is holier than all of us\nand he follows a rule harder than ours. And if he does not go to\nchurch, it’s because he knows when he ought to; he has his own rule.”\nIt was to avoid the chance of these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont\nwas left in peace.\n\nAs every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father\nZossima. And now the news had reached him in his hut that “God’s\njudgment is not the same as man’s,” and that something had happened\nwhich was “in excess of nature.” It may well be supposed that among the\nfirst to run to him with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had\nvisited him the evening before and left his cell terror‐stricken.\n\nI have mentioned above, that though Father Païssy, standing firm and\nimmovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see\nwhat was passing outside the cell, he gauged most of it correctly in\nhis heart, for he knew the men surrounding him, well. He was not shaken\nby it, but awaited what would come next without fear, watching with\npenetration and insight for the outcome of the general excitement.",
            "10": "Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of\ndecorum burst on his ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont\nappeared in the doorway. Behind him there could be seen accompanying\nhim a crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. They did\nnot, however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps,\nwaiting to see what Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with\na certain awe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for\nnothing. Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and\nunder his right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from\nObdorsk peeped in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could not resist\nrunning up the steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the\ncontrary, pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the door was\nnoisily flung open. Holding his hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly\nroared:\n\n“Casting out I cast out!” and, turning in all directions, he began at\nonce making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four\ncorners of the cell in succession. All who accompanied Father Ferapont\nimmediately understood his action. For they knew he always did this\nwherever he went, and that he would not sit down or say a word, till he\nhad driven out the evil spirits.\n\n“Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!” he repeated at each sign of the\ncross. “Casting out I cast out,” he roared again.\n\nHe was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope. His bare chest,\ncovered with gray hair, could be seen under his hempen shirt. His feet\nwere bare. As soon as he began waving his arms, the cruel irons he wore\nunder his gown could be heard clanking.\n\nFather Païssy paused in his reading, stepped forward and stood before\nhim waiting.\n\n“What have you come for, worthy Father? Why do you offend against good\norder? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock?” he said at last,\nlooking sternly at him.\n\n“What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?” shouted Father\nFerapont crazily. “I’ve come here to drive out your visitors, the\nunclean devils. I’ve come to see how many have gathered here while I\nhave been away. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.”\n\n“You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him\nyourself,” Father Païssy went on fearlessly. “And who can say of\nhimself ‘I am holy’? Can you, Father?”",
            "11": "“I am unclean, not holy. I would not sit in an arm‐chair and would not\nhave them bow down to me as an idol,” thundered Father Ferapont.\n“Nowadays folk destroy the true faith. The dead man, your saint,” he\nturned to the crowd, pointing with his finger to the coffin, “did not\nbelieve in devils. He gave medicine to keep off the devils. And so they\nhave become as common as spiders in the corners. And now he has begun\nto stink himself. In that we see a great sign from God.”\n\nThe incident he referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in\nhis dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil\nspirits. When in the utmost terror he confided this to Father Zossima,\nthe elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting. But when that\nwas of no use, he advised him, while persisting in prayer and fasting,\nto take a special medicine. Many persons were shocked at the time and\nwagged their heads as they talked over it—and most of all Father\nFerapont, to whom some of the censorious had hastened to report this\n“extraordinary” counsel on the part of the elder.\n\n“Go away, Father!” said Father Païssy, in a commanding voice, “it’s not\nfor man to judge but for God. Perhaps we see here a ‘sign’ which\nneither you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go,\nFather, and do not trouble the flock!” he repeated impressively.\n\n“He did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign\nhas come. That is clear and it’s a sin to hide it,” the fanatic,\ncarried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason, would not be\nquieted. “He was seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him in\ntheir pockets, he sipped tea, he worshiped his belly, filling it with\nsweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts.... And for this he is\nput to shame....”\n\n“You speak lightly, Father.” Father Païssy, too, raised his voice. “I\nadmire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some\nfrivolous youth, fickle and childish. Go away, Father, I command you!”\nFather Païssy thundered in conclusion.\n\n“I will go,” said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as\nbitter. “You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my\nhumbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have\nforgotten what I did know, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness\nfrom your subtlety.”",
            "12": "Father Païssy stood over him, waiting resolutely. Father Ferapont\npaused and, suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently,\npronounced in a sing‐song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead\nelder:\n\n“To‐morrow they will sing over him ‘Our Helper and Defender’—a splendid\nanthem—and over me when I die all they’ll sing will be ‘What earthly\njoy’—a little canticle,”[6] he added with tearful regret. “You are\nproud and puffed up, this is a vain place!” he shouted suddenly like a\nmadman, and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly\ndescended the steps. The crowd awaiting him below wavered; some\nfollowed him at once and some lingered, for the cell was still open,\nand Father Païssy, following Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood\nwatching him. But the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced.\nWalking twenty steps away, he suddenly turned towards the setting sun,\nraised both his arms and, as though some one had cut him down, fell to\nthe ground with a loud scream.\n\n“My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun!” he\nshouted frantically, stretching up his hands to the sun, and falling\nface downwards on the ground, he sobbed like a little child, shaken by\nhis tears and spreading out his arms on the ground. Then all rushed up\nto him; there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of\nfrenzy seemed to take possession of them all.\n\n“This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!”\nsome cried aloud, losing their fear. “This is he who should be an\nelder,” others added malignantly.",
            "13": "“He wouldn’t be an elder ... he would refuse ... he wouldn’t serve a\ncursed innovation ... he wouldn’t imitate their foolery,” other voices\nchimed in at once. And it is hard to say how far they might have gone,\nbut at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service. All began\ncrossing themselves at once. Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing\nhimself went back to his cell without looking round, still uttering\nexclamations which were utterly incoherent. A few followed him, but the\ngreater number dispersed, hastening to service. Father Païssy let\nFather Iosif read in his place and went down. The frantic outcries of\nbigots could not shake him, but his heart was suddenly filled with\nmelancholy for some special reason and he felt that. He stood still and\nsuddenly wondered, “Why am I sad even to dejection?” and immediately\ngrasped with surprise that his sudden sadness was due to a very small\nand special cause. In the crowd thronging at the entrance to the cell,\nhe had noticed Alyosha and he remembered that he had felt at once a\npang at heart on seeing him. “Can that boy mean so much to my heart\nnow?” he asked himself, wondering.\n\nAt that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not in the\ndirection of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away\nhis eyes and dropped them to the ground, and from the boy’s look alone,\nFather Païssy guessed what a great change was taking place in him at\nthat moment.\n\n“Have you, too, fallen into temptation?” cried Father Païssy. “Can you\nbe with those of little faith?” he added mournfully.\n\nAlyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Païssy, but quickly\nturned his eyes away again and again looked on the ground. He stood\nsideways and did not turn his face to Father Païssy, who watched him\nattentively.\n\n“Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,” he asked again,\nbut again Alyosha gave no answer.\n\n“Are you leaving the hermitage? What, without asking leave, without\nasking a blessing?”\n\nAlyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look\nat the Father to whom his former guide, the former sovereign of his\nheart and mind, his beloved elder, had confided him as he lay dying.\nAnd suddenly, still without speaking, waved his hand, as though not\ncaring even to be respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the\ngates away from the hermitage.\n\n“You will come back again!” murmured Father Païssy, looking after him\nwith sorrowful surprise."

            "0": "Father Païssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his “dear\nboy” would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he\npenetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha’s spiritual\ncondition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for\nme to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of\nthe young hero I love so much. To Father Païssy’s sorrowful question,\n“Are you too with those of little faith?” I could of course confidently\nanswer for Alyosha, “No, he is not with those of little faith. Quite\nthe contrary.” Indeed, all his trouble came from the fact that he was\nof great faith. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing\nthat even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one\nof the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is\nasked: “Could all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the\nfact that his elder’s body had shown signs of premature decomposition\ninstead of at once performing miracles?” I must answer without beating\nabout the bush, “Yes, it certainly was.” I would only beg the reader\nnot to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero’s pure heart.\nI am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent\nfaith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in\nhis studies, or any such reason. I must declare, on the contrary, that\nI have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart. No doubt a youth\nwho received impressions cautiously, whose love was lukewarm, and whose\nmind was too prudent for his age and so of little value, such a young\nman might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my hero. But in some\ncases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion,\nhowever unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to be\nunmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always\nsensible is to be suspected and is of little worth—that’s my opinion!\n\n“But,” reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, “every young man cannot\nbelieve in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.”\n\nTo this I reply again, “Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and\nsteadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.”",
            "1": "Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not\nexplain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary\nfor the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was\nnot a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient\nexpectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at\nthe time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea—oh, no, not at\nall—what he saw before all was one figure—the figure of his beloved\nelder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration.\nThe fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young\nheart for every one and everything had, for the past year, been\nconcentrated—and perhaps wrongly so—on one being, his beloved elder. It\nis true that being had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal,\nthat all his young strength and energy could not but turn towards that\nideal, even to the forgetting at the moment “of every one and\neverything.” He remembered afterwards how, on that terrible day, he had\nentirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so\nanxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the\ntwo hundred roubles to Ilusha’s father, though he had so warmly\nintended to do so the preceding evening. But again it was not miracles\nhe needed but only “the higher justice” which had been in his belief\noutraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his\nheart. And what does it signify that this “justice” looked for by\nAlyosha inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately\nby the ashes of his adored teacher? Why, every one in the monastery\ncherished the same thought and the same hope, even those whose\nintellects Alyosha revered, Father Païssy himself, for instance. And so\nAlyosha, untroubled by doubts, clothed his dreams too in the same form\nas all the rest. And a whole year of life in the monastery had formed\nthe habit of this expectation in his heart. But it was justice,\njustice, he thirsted for, not simply miracles.",
            "2": "And now the man who should, he believed, have been exalted above every\none in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that\nwas his due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored! What for? Who had\njudged him? Who could have decreed this? Those were the questions that\nwrung his inexperienced and virginal heart. He could not endure without\nmortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men\nshould have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the\nfrivolous crowd so inferior to him. Even had there been no miracles,\nhad there been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes, why this\nindignity, why this humiliation, why this premature decay, “in excess\nof nature,” as the spiteful monks said? Why this “sign from heaven,”\nwhich they so triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont,\nand why did they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it? Where\nis the finger of Providence? Why did Providence hide its face “at the\nmost critical moment” (so Alyosha thought it), as though voluntarily\nsubmitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?\n\nThat was why Alyosha’s heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have\nsaid already, the sting of it all was that the man he loved above\neverything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated! This\nmurmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I\nrepeat again for the third time—and am prepared to admit that it might\nbe difficult to defend my feeling—I am glad that my hero showed himself\nnot too reasonable at that moment, for any man of sense will always\ncome back to reason in time, but, if love does not gain the upper hand\nin a boy’s heart at such an exceptional moment, when will it? I will\nnot, however, omit to mention something strange, which came for a time\nto the surface of Alyosha’s mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This\nnew something was the harassing impression left by the conversation\nwith Ivan, which now persistently haunted Alyosha’s mind. At this\nmoment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the\nfundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken.\nHe loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was\nsuddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil\nimpression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly\nrevived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface\nof his consciousness.",
            "3": "It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the\nhermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face\ndownwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep.\nHe went up and called him by his name.\n\n“You here, Alexey? Can you have—” he began wondering but broke off. He\nhad meant to say, “Can you have come to this?”\n\nAlyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once\nsaw that he heard and understood him.\n\n“What’s the matter?” he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually\npassed into a smile that became more and more ironical.\n\n“I say, I’ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly\ndisappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this? You might just\nlook at me...”\n\nAlyosha raised his head, sat up and leaned his back against the tree.\nHe was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability\nin his face. He did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to\none side of him.\n\n“Do you know your face is quite changed? There’s none of your famous\nmildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been\nill‐treating you?”\n\n“Let me alone,” said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his\nhand, still looking away from him.\n\n“Oho! So that’s how we are feeling! So you can shout at people like\nother mortals. That is a come‐down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you\nhave surprised me, do you hear? I mean it. It’s long since I’ve been\nsurprised at anything here. I always took you for an educated man....”\n\nAlyosha at last looked at him, but vaguely, as though scarcely\nunderstanding what he said.\n\n“Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to\nstink? You don’t mean to say you seriously believed that he was going\nto work miracles?” exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again.\n\n“I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what\nmore do you want?” cried Alyosha irritably.\n\n“Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen\nbelieves in that now. But there.... So now you are in a temper with\nyour God, you are rebelling against Him; He hasn’t given promotion, He\nhasn’t bestowed the order of merit! Eh, you are a set!”\n\nAlyosha gazed a long while with his eyes half closed at Rakitin, and\nthere was a sudden gleam in his eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.\n\n“I am not rebelling against my God; I simply ‘don’t accept His world.’\n” Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.",
            "4": "“How do you mean, you don’t accept the world?” Rakitin thought a moment\nover his answer. “What idiocy is this?”\n\nAlyosha did not answer.\n\n“Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat\nto‐ day?”\n\n“I don’t remember.... I think I have.”\n\n“You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look\nat you. You didn’t sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in\nthere. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you’ve had\nnothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I’ve got some sausage in\nmy pocket; I’ve brought it from the town in case of need, only you\nwon’t eat sausage....”\n\n“Give me some.”\n\n“I say! You are going it! Why, it’s a regular mutiny, with barricades!\nWell, my boy, we must make the most of it. Come to my place.... I\nshouldn’t mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is\ngoing too far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?”\n\n“Give me some vodka too.”\n\n“Hullo! You surprise me, brother!” Rakitin looked at him in amazement.\n“Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine\nchance and mustn’t be missed. Come along.”\n\nAlyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin.\n\n“If your little brother Ivan could see this—wouldn’t he be surprised!\nBy the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you\nknow?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his\nbrother Dmitri rose before his mind. But only for a minute, and though\nit reminded him of something that must not be put off for a moment,\nsome duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder made no\nimpression on him, did not reach his heart and instantly faded out of\nhis mind and was forgotten. But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha\nremembered this.\n\n“Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a ‘liberal booby with no\ntalents whatsoever.’ Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I\nwas ‘dishonorable.’ Well! I should like to see what your talents and\nsense of honor will do for you now.” This phrase Rakitin finished to\nhimself in a whisper.",
            "5": "“Listen!” he said aloud, “let’s go by the path beyond the monastery\nstraight to the town. Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov’s by the\nway. Only fancy, I’ve written to tell her everything that happened, and\nwould you believe it, she answered me instantly in pencil (the lady has\na passion for writing notes) that ‘she would never have expected _such\nconduct_ from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.’\nThat was her very word: ‘conduct.’ She is angry too. Eh, you are a set!\nStay!” he cried suddenly again. He suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha\nby the shoulder made him stop too.\n\n“Do you know, Alyosha,” he peeped inquisitively into his eyes, absorbed\nin a sudden new thought which had dawned on him, and though he was\nlaughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea\naloud, so difficult he still found it to believe in the strange and\nunexpected mood in which he now saw Alyosha. “Alyosha, do you know\nwhere we had better go?” he brought out at last timidly, and\ninsinuatingly.\n\n“I don’t care ... where you like.”\n\n“Let’s go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come?” pronounced Rakitin at last,\ntrembling with timid suspense.\n\n“Let’s go to Grushenka,” Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this\nprompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he almost\nstarted back.\n\n“Well! I say!” he cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the\narm he led him along the path, still dreading that he would change his\nmind.\n\nThey walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk.\n\n“And how glad she will be, how delighted!” he muttered, but lapsed into\nsilence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he was taking\nAlyosha to her. He was a practical person and never undertook anything\nwithout a prospect of gain for himself. His object in this case was\ntwofold, first a revengeful desire to see “the downfall of the\nrighteous,” and Alyosha’s fall “from the saints to the sinners,” over\nwhich he was already gloating in his imagination, and in the second\nplace he had in view a certain material gain for himself, of which more\nwill be said later.\n\n“So the critical moment has come,” he thought to himself with spiteful\nglee, “and we shall catch it on the hop, for it’s just what we want.”"

            "0": "Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedral\nsquare, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house\nof the widow Morozov. The house was a large stone building of two\nstories, old and very ugly. The widow led a secluded life with her two\nunmarried nieces, who were also elderly women. She had no need to let\nher lodge, but every one knew that she had taken in Grushenka as a\nlodger, four years before, solely to please her kinsman, the merchant\nSamsonov, who was known to be the girl’s protector. It was said that\nthe jealous old man’s object in placing his “favorite” with the widow\nMorozov was that the old woman should keep a sharp eye on her new\nlodger’s conduct. But this sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary, and\nin the end the widow Morozov seldom met Grushenka and did not worry her\nby looking after her in any way. It is true that four years had passed\nsince the old man had brought the slim, delicate, shy, timid, dreamy,\nand sad girl of eighteen from the chief town of the province, and much\nhad happened since then. Little was known of the girl’s history in the\ntown and that little was vague. Nothing more had been learnt during the\nlast four years, even after many persons had become interested in the\nbeautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna had meanwhile\ndeveloped. There were rumors that she had been at seventeen betrayed by\nsome one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards abandoned by\nhim. The officer had gone away and afterwards married, while Grushenka\nhad been left in poverty and disgrace. It was said, however, that\nthough Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man,\nSamsonov, she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical\nclass, that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.",
            "1": "And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little\norphan had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of\nbold and determined character, proud and insolent. She had a good head\nfor business, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or\nfoul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune. There\nwas only one point on which all were agreed. Grushenka was not easily\nto be approached and except her aged protector there had not been one\nman who could boast of her favors during those four years. It was a\npositive fact, for there had been a good many, especially during the\nlast two years, who had attempted to obtain those favors. But all their\nefforts had been in vain and some of these suitors had been forced to\nbeat an undignified and even comic retreat, owing to the firm and\nironical resistance they met from the strong‐willed young person. It\nwas known, too, that the young person had, especially of late, been\ngiven to what is called “speculation,” and that she had shown marked\nabilities in that direction, so that many people began to say that she\nwas no better than a Jew. It was not that she lent money on interest,\nbut it was known, for instance, that she had for some time past, in\npartnership with old Karamazov, actually invested in the purchase of\nbad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their nominal value, and afterwards\nhad made out of them ten times their value.\n\nThe old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and\nmerciless. He tyrannized over his grown‐up sons, but, for the last year\nduring which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs, he\nhad fallen greatly under the influence of his protégée, whom he had at\nfirst kept strictly and in humble surroundings, “on Lenten fare,” as\nthe wits said at the time. But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating\nherself, while she established in him a boundless belief in her\nfidelity. The old man, now long since dead, had had a large business in\nhis day and was also a noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint.\nThough Grushenka’s hold upon him was so strong that he could not live\nwithout her (it had been so especially for the last two years), he did\nnot settle any considerable fortune on her and would not have been\nmoved to do so, if she had threatened to leave him. But he had\npresented her with a small sum, and even that was a surprise to every\none when it became known.",
            "2": "“You are a wench with brains,” he said to her, when he gave her eight\nthousand roubles, “and you must look after yourself, but let me tell\nyou that except your yearly allowance as before, you’ll get nothing\nmore from me to the day of my death, and I’ll leave you nothing in my\nwill either.”\n\nAnd he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons, whom,\nwith their wives and children, he had treated all his life as servants.\nGrushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known\nafterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital\nand put business in her way.\n\nWhen Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over\na piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in\nlove with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely\namused. It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance\nGrushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and\nhe seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was\nso. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the\nold man left off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a\nstern and earnest piece of advice.\n\n“If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you’d better\nchoose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry\nyou and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But don’t keep on with\nthe captain, you’ll get no good out of that.”\n\nThese were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that\nhis death was not far off and who actually died five months later.\n\nI will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of\nthe grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son,\nthe object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what\nreally underlay her attitude to both of them. Even Grushenka’s two\nservants (after the catastrophe of which we will speak later) testified\nin court that she received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because\n“he threatened to murder her.” These servants were an old cook,\ninvalidish and almost deaf, who came from Grushenka’s old home, and her\ngranddaughter, a smart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties\nof a maid. Grushenka lived very economically and her surroundings were\nanything but luxurious. Her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished\nwith mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her\nlandlady.",
            "3": "It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her rooms, yet they\nwere not lighted up. Grushenka was lying down in her drawing‐room on\nthe big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered\nwith shabby and ragged leather. Under her head she had two white down\npillows taken from her bed. She was lying stretched out motionless on\nher back with her hands behind her head. She was dressed as though\nexpecting some one, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on\nher head, which was very becoming. Over her shoulders was thrown a lace\nshawl pinned with a massive gold brooch. She certainly was expecting\nsome one. She lay as though impatient and weary, her face rather pale\nand her lips and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with\nthe tip of her right foot. The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused\na slight excitement. From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up\nfrom the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, “Who’s there?” But the\nmaid met the visitors and at once called back to her mistress.\n\n“It’s not he, it’s nothing, only other visitors.”\n\n“What can be the matter?” muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into the\ndrawing‐room.\n\nGrushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. A thick\ncoil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on\nher right shoulder, but she did not notice it and did not put it back\ntill she had gazed at her visitors and recognized them.\n\n“Ah, it’s you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?\nWho is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him!” she\nexclaimed, recognizing Alyosha.\n\n“Do send for candles!” said Rakitin, with the free‐and‐easy air of a\nmost intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.\n\n“Candles ... of course, candles.... Fenya, fetch him a candle.... Well,\nyou have chosen a moment to bring him!” she exclaimed again, nodding\ntowards Alyosha, and turning to the looking‐glass she began quickly\nfastening up her hair with both hands. She seemed displeased.\n\n“Haven’t I managed to please you?” asked Rakitin, instantly almost\noffended.",
            "4": "“You frightened me, Rakitin, that’s what it is.” Grushenka turned with\na smile to Alyosha. “Don’t be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot\nthink how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor. But you\nfrightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I\ndeceived him just now, I made him promise to believe me and I told him\na lie. I told him that I was going to spend the evening with my old\nman, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till late counting up his\nmoney. I always spend one whole evening a week with him making up his\naccounts. We lock ourselves in and he counts on the reckoning beads\nwhile I sit and put things down in the book. I am the only person he\ntrusts. Mitya believes that I am there, but I came back and have been\nsitting locked in here, expecting some news. How was it Fenya let you\nin? Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open it and look about whether\nthe captain is to be seen! Perhaps he is hiding and spying, I am\ndreadfully frightened.”\n\n“There’s no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I’ve just looked out, I\nkeep running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling\nmyself.”\n\n“Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains—that’s\nbetter!” She drew the heavy curtains herself. “He’d rush in at once if\nhe saw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to‐day, Alyosha.”\n\nGrushenka spoke aloud, and, though she was alarmed, she seemed very\nhappy about something.\n\n“Why are you so afraid of Mitya to‐day?” inquired Rakitin. “I should\nhave thought you were not timid with him, you’d twist him round your\nlittle finger.”\n\n“I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don’t want Mitya\nat all. And he didn’t believe, I feel he didn’t, that I should stay at\nKuzma Kuzmitch’s. He must be in his ambush now, behind Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s, in the garden, watching for me. And if he’s there, he\nwon’t come here, so much the better! But I really have been to Kuzma\nKuzmitch’s, Mitya escorted me there. I told him I should stay there\ntill midnight, and I asked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch\nme home. He went away and I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and\ncame back here again. Ugh, I was afraid, I ran for fear of meeting\nhim.”\n\n“And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you’ve got on!”\n\n“How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting a\nmessage. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and you\nwill see no more of me. That’s why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.”",
            "5": "“And where are you flying to?”\n\n“If you know too much, you’ll get old too soon.”\n\n“Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I’ve never seen you like\nthis before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.”\nRakitin looked her up and down.\n\n“Much you know about balls.”\n\n“And do you know much about them?”\n\n“I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch’s son was\nmarried and I looked on from the gallery. Do you suppose I want to be\ntalking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here.\nSuch a visitor! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you and can’t believe\nmy eyes. Good heavens, can you have come here to see me! To tell you\nthe truth, I never had a thought of seeing you and I didn’t think that\nyou would ever come and see me. Though this is not the moment now, I am\nawfully glad to see you. Sit down on the sofa, here, that’s right, my\nbright young moon. I really can’t take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin,\nif only you had brought him yesterday or the day before! But I am glad\nas it is! Perhaps it’s better he has come now, at such a moment, and\nnot the day before yesterday.”\n\nShe gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him with\npositive delight. And she really was glad, she was not lying when she\nsaid so. Her eyes glowed, her lips laughed, but it was a good‐hearted\nmerry laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in\nher face.... He had hardly met her till the day before, he had formed\nan alarming idea of her, and had been horribly distressed the day\nbefore by the spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on Katerina\nIvanovna. He was greatly surprised to find her now altogether different\nfrom what he had expected. And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow,\nhis eyes involuntarily rested on her with attention. Her whole manner\nseemed changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any\ntrace of that mawkish sweetness in her speech, of that voluptuous\nsoftness in her movements. Everything was simple and good‐natured, her\ngestures were rapid, direct, confiding, but she was greatly excited.\n\n“Dear me, how everything comes together to‐day!” she chattered on\nagain. “And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn’t say\nmyself! If you ask me, I couldn’t tell you.”\n\n“Come, don’t you know why you’re glad?” said Rakitin, grinning. “You\nused to be always pestering me to bring him, you’d some object, I\nsuppose.”",
            "6": "“I had a different object once, but now that’s over, this is not the\nmoment. I say, I want you to have something nice. I am so good‐natured\nnow. You sit down, too, Rakitin; why are you standing? You’ve sat down\nalready? There’s no fear of Rakitin’s forgetting to look after himself.\nLook, Alyosha, he’s sitting there opposite us, so offended that I\ndidn’t ask him to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to\ntake offense!” laughed Grushenka. “Don’t be angry, Rakitin, I’m kind\nto‐day. Why are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?” She\npeeped into his eyes with merry mockery”\n\n“He’s sad. The promotion has not been given,” boomed Rakitin.\n\n“What promotion?”\n\n“His elder stinks.”\n\n“What? You are talking some nonsense, you want to say something nasty.\nBe quiet, you stupid! Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this.” She\nsuddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his knee, like a\nnestling kitten, with her right arm about his neck. “I’ll cheer you up,\nmy pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee? You won’t\nbe angry? If you tell me, I’ll get off?”\n\nAlyosha did not speak. He sat afraid to move, he heard her words, “If\nyou tell me, I’ll get off,” but he did not answer. But there was\nnothing in his heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him\nmalignantly from his corner, might have expected or fancied. The great\ngrief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been\naroused, and, if only he could have thought clearly at that moment, he\nwould have realized that he had now the strongest armor to protect him\nfrom every lust and temptation. Yet in spite of the vague\nirresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and the sorrow that\noverwhelmed him, he could not help wondering at a new and strange\nsensation in his heart. This woman, this “dreadful” woman, had no\nterror for him now, none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at\nany passing thought of woman. On the contrary, this woman, dreaded\nabove all women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms,\naroused in him now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a\nfeeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear,\nof his former terror. That was what instinctively surprised him.\n\n“You’ve talked nonsense enough,” cried Rakitin, “you’d much better give\nus some champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!”",
            "7": "“Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on\nthe top of everything, if he’d bring you? I’ll have some too! Fenya,\nFenya, bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so\nstingy, I’ll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you’re a toadstool,\nbut he is a falcon! And though my heart is full of something very\ndifferent, so be it, I’ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.”\n\n“But what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask,\nor is it a secret?” Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to\npretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at\nhim.\n\n“Ech, it’s not a secret, and you know it, too,” Grushenka said, in a\nvoice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a\nlittle away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm\nround his neck. “My officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.”\n\n“I heard he was coming, but is he so near?”\n\n“He is at Mokroe now; he’ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I\ngot a letter from him to‐day. I am expecting the messenger every\nminute.”\n\n“You don’t say so! Why at Mokroe?”\n\n“That’s a long story, I’ve told you enough.”\n\n“Mitya’ll be up to something now—I say! Does he know or doesn’t he?”\n\n“He know! Of course he doesn’t. If he knew, there would be murder. But\nI am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet,\nRakitin, don’t remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my\nheart. And I don’t want to think of that at this moment. I can think of\nAlyosha here, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up,\nsmile at my foolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, he’s smiling, he’s\nsmiling! How kindly he looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, I’ve been\nthinking all this time you were angry with me, because of the day\nbefore yesterday, because of that young lady. I was a cur, that’s the\ntruth.... But it’s a good thing it happened so. It was a horrid thing,\nbut a good thing too.” Grushenka smiled dreamily and a little cruel\nline showed in her smile. “Mitya told me that she screamed out that I\n‘ought to be flogged.’ I did insult her dreadfully. She sent for me,\nshe wanted to make a conquest of me, to win me over with her\nchocolate.... No, it’s a good thing it did end like that.” She smiled\nagain. “But I am still afraid of your being angry.”\n\n“Yes, that’s really true,” Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine\nsurprise. “Alyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.”",
            "8": "“He is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you’ve no conscience,\nthat’s what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that’s how it\nis! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?”\n\n“Ah, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!”\n\n“Well, what of it, I love him!”\n\n“And what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?”\n\n“That is quite different.”\n\n“That’s a woman’s way of looking at it!”\n\n“Don’t you make me angry, Rakitin.” Grushenka caught him up hotly.\n“This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. It’s true,\nAlyosha, I had sly designs on you before. For I am a horrid, violent\ncreature. But at other times I’ve looked upon you, Alyosha, as my\nconscience. I’ve kept thinking ‘how any one like that must despise a\nnasty thing like me.’ I thought that the day before yesterday, as I ran\nhome from the young lady’s. I have thought of you a long time in that\nway, Alyosha, and Mitya knows, I’ve talked to him about it. Mitya\nunderstands. Would you believe it, I sometimes look at you and feel\nashamed, utterly ashamed of myself.... And how, and since when, I began\nto think about you like that, I can’t say, I don’t remember....”\n\nFenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses\nof champagne on the table.\n\n“Here’s the champagne!” cried Rakitin. “You’re excited, Agrafena\nAlexandrovna, and not yourself. When you’ve had a glass of champagne,\nyou’ll be ready to dance. Eh, they can’t even do that properly,” he\nadded, looking at the bottle. “The old woman’s poured it out in the\nkitchen and the bottle’s been brought in warm and without a cork. Well,\nlet me have some, anyway.”\n\nHe went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and\npoured himself out another.\n\n“One doesn’t often stumble upon champagne,” he said, licking his lips.\n“Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do! What shall we drink\nto? The gates of paradise? Take a glass, Grushenka, you drink to the\ngates of paradise, too.”\n\n“What gates of paradise?”\n\nShe took a glass, Alyosha took his, tasted it and put it back.\n\n“No, I’d better not,” he smiled gently.\n\n“And you bragged!” cried Rakitin.\n\n“Well, if so, I won’t either,” chimed in Grushenka, “I really don’t\nwant any. You can drink the whole bottle alone, Rakitin. If Alyosha has\nsome, I will.”",
            "9": "“What touching sentimentality!” said Rakitin tauntingly; “and she’s\nsitting on his knee, too! He’s got something to grieve over, but what’s\nthe matter with you? He is rebelling against his God and ready to eat\nsausage....”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“His elder died to‐day, Father Zossima, the saint.”\n\n“So Father Zossima is dead,” cried Grushenka. “Good God, I did not\nknow!” She crossed herself devoutly. “Goodness, what have I been doing,\nsitting on his knee like this at such a moment!” She started up as\nthough in dismay, instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the\nsofa.\n\nAlyosha bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn\nin his face.\n\n“Rakitin,” he said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; “don’t taunt me\nwith having rebelled against God. I don’t want to feel angry with you,\nso you must be kinder, too, I’ve lost a treasure such as you have never\nhad, and you cannot judge me now. You had much better look at her—do\nyou see how she has pity on me? I came here to find a wicked soul—I\nfelt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself, and I’ve found a\ntrue sister, I have found a treasure—a loving heart. She had pity on me\njust now.... Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You’ve raised\nmy soul from the depths.”\n\nAlyosha’s lips were quivering and he caught his breath.\n\n“She has saved you, it seems,” laughed Rakitin spitefully. “And she\nmeant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?”\n\n“Stay, Rakitin.” Grushenka jumped up. “Hush, both of you. Now I’ll tell\nyou all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am\nbad and not good—that’s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you\nare telling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my\nclutches, but now you are lying, now it’s all different. And don’t let\nme hear anything more from you, Rakitin.”\n\nAll this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.\n\n“They are both crazy,” said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. “I\nfeel as though I were in a madhouse. They’re both getting so feeble\nthey’ll begin crying in a minute.”\n\n“I shall begin to cry, I shall,” repeated Grushenka. “He called me his\nsister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin,\nthough I am bad, I did give away an onion.”\n\n“An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.”",
            "10": "Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed,\nthough he might have reflected that each of them was just passing\nthrough a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime.\nBut though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned\nhimself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of\nothers—partly from his youth and inexperience, partly from his intense\negoism.",
            "11": "“You see, Alyosha,” Grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh. “I\nwas boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but it’s\nnot to boast I tell you about it. It’s only a story, but it’s a nice\nstory. I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who\nis still with me. It’s like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant\nwoman and a very wicked woman she was. And she died and did not leave a\nsingle good deed behind. The devils caught her and plunged her into the\nlake of fire. So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed\nof hers he could remember to tell to God; ‘She once pulled up an onion\nin her garden,’ said he, ‘and gave it to a beggar woman.’ And God\nanswered: ‘You take that onion then, hold it out to her in the lake,\nand let her take hold and be pulled out. And if you can pull her out of\nthe lake, let her come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the\nwoman must stay where she is.’ The angel ran to the woman and held out\nthe onion to her. ‘Come,’ said he, ‘catch hold and I’ll pull you out.’\nAnd he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her right\nout, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was being drawn\nout, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her. But\nshe was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them. ‘I’m to be\npulled out, not you. It’s my onion, not yours.’ As soon as she said\nthat, the onion broke. And the woman fell into the lake and she is\nburning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away. So that’s\nthe story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman\nmyself. I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you\nI’ll say: ‘I’ve done nothing but give away one onion all my life,\nthat’s the only good deed I’ve done.’ So don’t praise me, Alyosha,\ndon’t think me good, I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me\nashamed if you praise me. Eh, I must confess everything. Listen,\nAlyosha. I was so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin\ntwenty‐five roubles if he would bring you to me. Stay, Rakitin, wait!”\n\nShe went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out a\npurse and took from it a twenty‐five rouble note.\n\n“What nonsense! What nonsense!” cried Rakitin, disconcerted.\n\n“Take it. Rakitin, I owe it you, there’s no fear of your refusing it,\nyou asked for it yourself.” And she threw the note to him.",
            "12": "“Likely I should refuse it,” boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, but\ncarrying off his confusion with a swagger. “That will come in very\nhandy; fools are made for wise men’s profit.”\n\n“And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not\nfor your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet. You don’t like\nus, so hold your tongue.”\n\n“What should I like you for?” Rakitin snarled, not concealing his ill‐\nhumor. He put the twenty‐five rouble note in his pocket and he felt\nashamed at Alyosha’s seeing it. He had reckoned on receiving his\npayment later, without Alyosha’s knowing of it, and now, feeling\nashamed, he lost his temper. Till that moment he had thought it\ndiscreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite of her\nsnubbing, since he had something to get out of her. But now he, too,\nwas angry:\n\n“One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done for\nme?”\n\n“You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.”\n\n“How does he love you? How has he shown it, that you make such a fuss\nabout it?”\n\nGrushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she spoke with heat\nand there were hysterical notes in her voice.",
            "13": "“Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us! And don’t dare to speak to\nme like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and\nbe quiet, as though you were my footman! And now, Alyosha, I’ll tell\nyou the whole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not\ntalking to Rakitin, but to you. I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, that’s\nthe holy truth; I quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed\nRakitin to bring you. And why did I want to do such a thing? You knew\nnothing about it, Alyosha, you turned away from me; if you passed me,\nyou dropped your eyes. And I’ve looked at you a hundred times before\nto‐day; I began asking every one about you. Your face haunted my heart.\n‘He despises me,’ I thought; ‘he won’t even look at me.’ And I felt it\nso much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a\nboy. I’ll get him in my clutches and laugh at him. I was full of spite\nand anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or think of\ncoming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose. Old Kuzma is the\nonly man I have anything to do with here; I was bound and sold to him;\nSatan brought us together, but there has been no one else. But looking\nat you, I thought, I’ll get him in my clutches and laugh at him. You\nsee what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me your sister! And now\nthat man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for a message from\nhim. And do you know what that man has been to me? Five years ago, when\nKuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one might have\nsight or sound of me. I was a silly slip of a girl; I used to sit here\nsobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: ‘Where is he now, the\nman who wronged me? He is laughing at me with another woman, most\nlikely. If only I could see him, if I could meet him again, I’d pay him\nout, I’d pay him out!’ At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in\nthe dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on\npurpose and gloat over my anger. ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’\nThat’s what I used to cry out in the dark. And when I suddenly thought\nthat I should really do nothing to him, and that he was laughing at me\nthen, or perhaps had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the\nfloor, melt into helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn. In\nthe morning I would get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the\nwhole world to pieces. And then what do you think? I began saving\nmoney, I became hard‐hearted, grew stout—grew wiser, would you say? No,\nno one in the whole world sees it, no one knows it, but when night\ncomes on, I sometimes lie as I did five years ago, when I was a silly\ngirl, clenching my teeth and crying all night, thinking, ‘I’ll pay him\nout, I’ll pay him out!’ Do you hear? Well then, now you understand me.\nA month ago a letter came to me—he was coming, he was a widower, he\nwanted to see me. It took my breath away; then I suddenly thought: ‘If\nhe comes and whistles to call me, I shall creep back to him like a\nbeaten dog.’ I couldn’t believe myself. Am I so abject? Shall I run to\nhim or not? And I’ve been in such a rage with myself all this month\nthat I am worse than I was five years ago. Do you see now, Alyosha,\nwhat a violent, vindictive creature I am? I have shown you the whole\ntruth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that other. Hush,\nRakitin, it’s not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to you. Before\nyou came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole\nfuture life, and you can never know what was in my heart. Yes, Alyosha,\ntell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened the day\nbefore yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I am going\nthrough now, and no one ever can know.... For perhaps I shall take a\nknife with me to‐day, I can’t make up my mind ...”",
            "14": "And at this “tragic” phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her face in her\nhands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little\nchild.\n\nAlyosha got up and went to Rakitin.\n\n“Misha,” he said, “don’t be angry. She wounded you, but don’t be angry.\nYou heard what she said just now? You mustn’t ask too much of human\nendurance, one must be merciful.”\n\nAlyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He felt\nobliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been\nthere, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him\nironically and Alyosha stopped short.\n\n“You were so primed up with your elder’s teaching last night that now\nyou have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!” said Rakitin, with a\nsmile of hatred.\n\n“Don’t laugh, Rakitin, don’t smile, don’t talk of the dead—he was\nbetter than any one in the world!” cried Alyosha, with tears in his\nvoice. “I didn’t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the\njudged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to\nmyself, ‘What does it matter?’ in my cowardliness, but she, after five\nyears in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the heart to\nher—it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in her tears!\nThe man who has wronged her has come back, he sends for her and she\nforgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to meet him and she won’t\ntake a knife with her. She won’t! No, I am not like that. I don’t know\nwhether you are, Misha, but I am not like that. It’s a lesson to me....\nShe is more loving than we.... Have you heard her speak before of what\nshe has just told us? No, you haven’t; if you had, you’d have\nunderstood her long ago ... and the person insulted the day before\nyesterday must forgive her, too! She will, when she knows ... and she\nshall know.... This soul is not yet at peace with itself, one must be\ntender with it ... there may be a treasure in that soul....”\n\nAlyosha stopped, because he caught his breath. In spite of his\nill‐humor Rakitin looked at him with astonishment. He had never\nexpected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.\n\n“She’s found some one to plead her cause! Why, are you in love with\nher? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk’s really in love with you, you’ve\nmade a conquest!” he cried, with a coarse laugh.\n\nGrushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with a\ntender smile shining on her tear‐stained face.",
            "15": "“Let him alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he is, he is not a\nperson for you to speak to. Mihail Osipovitch,” she turned to Rakitin,\n“I meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you, but now I don’t want\nto. Alyosha, come to me, sit down here.” She beckoned to him with a\nhappy smile. “That’s right, sit here. Tell me,” she shook him by the\nhand and peeped into his face, smiling, “tell me, do I love that man or\nnot? the man who wronged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I\nlay here in the dark, asking my heart whether I loved him. Decide for\nme, Alyosha, the time has come, it shall be as you say. Am I to forgive\nhim or not?”\n\n“But you have forgiven him already,” said Alyosha, smiling.\n\n“Yes, I really have forgiven him,” Grushenka murmured thoughtfully.\n“What an abject heart! To my abject heart!” She snatched up a glass\nfrom the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it\non the floor. The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came\ninto her smile.\n\n“Perhaps I haven’t forgiven him, though,” she said, with a sort of\nmenace in her voice, and she dropped her eyes to the ground as though\nshe were talking to herself. “Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to\nforgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, I’ve grown\nto love my tears in these five years.... Perhaps I only love my\nresentment, not him ...”\n\n“Well, I shouldn’t care to be in his shoes,” hissed Rakitin.\n\n“Well, you won’t be, Rakitin, you’ll never be in his shoes. You shall\nblack my shoes, Rakitin, that’s the place you are fit for. You’ll never\nget a woman like me ... and he won’t either, perhaps ...”\n\n“Won’t he? Then why are you dressed up like that?” said Rakitin, with a\nvenomous sneer.",
            "16": "“Don’t taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don’t know all that is\nin my heart! If I choose to tear off my finery, I’ll tear it off at\nonce, this minute,” she cried in a resonant voice. “You don’t know what\nthat finery is for, Rakitin! Perhaps I shall see him and say: ‘Have you\never seen me look like this before?’ He left me a thin, consumptive\ncry‐baby of seventeen. I’ll sit by him, fascinate him and work him up.\n‘Do you see what I am like now?’ I’ll say to him; ‘well, and that’s\nenough for you, my dear sir, there’s many a slip twixt the cup and the\nlip!’ That may be what the finery is for, Rakitin.” Grushenka finished\nwith a malicious laugh. “I’m violent and resentful, Alyosha, I’ll tear\noff my finery, I’ll destroy my beauty, I’ll scorch my face, slash it\nwith a knife, and turn beggar. If I choose, I won’t go anywhere now to\nsee any one. If I choose, I’ll send Kuzma back all he has ever given\nme, to‐morrow, and all his money and I’ll go out charing for the rest\nof my life. You think I wouldn’t do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare\nto do it? I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don’t\nexasperate me ... and I’ll send him about his business, I’ll snap my\nfingers in his face, he shall never see me again!”\n\nShe uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down\nagain, hid her face in her hands, buried it in the pillow and shook\nwith sobs.\n\nRakitin got up.\n\n“It’s time we were off,” he said, “it’s late, we shall be shut out of\nthe monastery.”\n\nGrushenka leapt up from her place.\n\n“Surely you don’t want to go, Alyosha!” she cried, in mournful\nsurprise. “What are you doing to me? You’ve stirred up my feeling,\ntortured me, and now you’ll leave me to face this night alone!”\n\n“He can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he wants to, let\nhim! I’ll go alone,” Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.\n\n“Hush, evil tongue!” Grushenka cried angrily at him; “you never said\nsuch words to me as he has come to say.”\n\n“What has he said to you so special?” asked Rakitin irritably.\n\n“I can’t say, I don’t know. I don’t know what he said to me, it went\nstraight to my heart; he has wrung my heart.... He is the first, the\nonly one who has pitied me, that’s what it is. Why did you not come\nbefore, you angel?” She fell on her knees before him as though in a\nsudden frenzy. “I’ve been waiting all my life for some one like you, I\nknew that some one like you would come and forgive me. I believed that,\nnasty as I am, some one would really love me, not only with a shameful\nlove!”",
            "17": "“What have I done to you?” answered Alyosha, bending over her with a\ntender smile, and gently taking her by the hands; “I only gave you an\nonion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!”\n\nHe was moved to tears himself as he said it. At that moment there was a\nsudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall. Grushenka\njumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. Fenya ran noisily into the room,\ncrying out:\n\n“Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,” she cried,\nbreathless and joyful. “A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey the\ndriver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses.... A\nletter, here’s the letter, mistress.”\n\nA letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while she\ntalked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the\ncandle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant.\n\n“He has sent for me,” she cried, her face white and distorted, with a\nwan smile; “he whistles! Crawl back, little dog!”\n\nBut only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the\nblood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks.\n\n“I will go,” she cried; “five years of my life! Good‐by! Good‐by,\nAlyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don’t let me\nsee you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don’t you remember\nevil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I\nfeel as though I were drunk!”\n\nShe suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom.\n\n“Well, she has no thoughts for us now!” grumbled Rakitin. “Let’s go, or\nwe may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears\nand cries.”\n\nAlyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a\ncovered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were\nrunning to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in\nat the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of\nthe steps, Grushenka’s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she\ncalled in a ringing voice after Alyosha:\n\n“Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to\nremember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell\nhim, too, in my words: ‘Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to\nyou, noble heart.’ And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one\nhour, only one short hour she loved him—so let him remember that hour\nall his life—say, ‘Grushenka tells you to!’ ”\n\nShe ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam.",
            "18": "“H’m, h’m!” growled Rakitin, laughing, “she murders your brother Mitya\nand then tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!”\n\nAlyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast\nbeside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought\nand moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had\nbeen touched on an open wound. He had expected something quite\ndifferent by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together. Something very\ndifferent from what he had hoped for had happened.\n\n“He is a Pole, that officer of hers,” he began again, restraining\nhimself; “and indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the\ncustoms in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little\nbeggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He’s heard now that\nGrushenka’s saved a little money, so he’s turned up again—that’s the\nexplanation of the mystery.”\n\nAgain Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself.\n\n“Well, so you’ve saved the sinner?” he laughed spitefully. “Have you\nturned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils,\neh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come\nto pass!”\n\n“Hush, Rakitin,” Alyosha answered with an aching heart.\n\n“So you despise me now for those twenty‐five roubles? I’ve sold my\nfriend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not\nJudas.”\n\n“Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I’d forgotten about it,” cried Alyosha, “you\nremind me of it yourself....”\n\nBut this was the last straw for Rakitin.\n\n“Damnation take you all and each of you!” he cried suddenly, “why the\ndevil did I take you up? I don’t want to know you from this time\nforward. Go alone, there’s your road!”\n\nAnd he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in\nthe dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to\nthe monastery."

            "0": "It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha\nreturned to the hermitage; the door‐keeper let him in by a special\nentrance. It had struck nine o’clock—the hour of rest and repose after\na day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and\nwent into the elder’s cell where his coffin was now standing. There was\nno one in the cell but Father Païssy, reading the Gospel in solitude\nover the coffin, and the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the\nprevious night’s conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day,\nwas sleeping the deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other\nroom. Though Father Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look\nin his direction. Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the\ncorner, fell on his knees and began to pray.\n\nHis soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation\nstood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow,\ncontinual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange\nto say, Alyosha was not surprised at it. Again he saw that coffin\nbefore him, the hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping\nand poignant grief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As\nsoon as he came in, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy\nshrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one\nwindow of the cell was open, the air was fresh and cool. “So the smell\nmust have become stronger, if they opened the window,” thought Alyosha.\nBut even this thought of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to\nhim so awful and humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him\nfeel miserable or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon felt\nthat he was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought floated\nthrough his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to be\nsucceeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his soul a sense of\nthe wholeness of things—something steadfast and comforting—and he was\naware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying ardently, he longed to\npour out his thankfulness and love....\n\nBut when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else,\nand sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had\ninterrupted it. He began listening to what Father Païssy was reading,\nbut worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze.",
            "1": "“_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_” read\nFather Païssy. “_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was\ncalled, and his disciples, to the marriage._”\n\n“Marriage? What’s that?... A marriage!” floated whirling through\nAlyosha’s mind. “There is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to\nthe feast.... No, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a\ntragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must\nbe. Tragic phrases comfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be\ntoo heavy for men to bear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley. As\nlong as Rakitin broods over his wrongs, he will always go off to the\nback alley.... But the high road ... The road is wide and straight and\nbright as crystal, and the sun is at the end of it.... Ah!... What’s\nbeing read?”...\n\n“_And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They\nhave no wine_” ... Alyosha heard.\n\n“Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn’t want to miss it, I love that\npassage: it’s Cana of Galilee, the first miracle.... Ah, that miracle!\nAh, that sweet miracle! It was not men’s grief, but their joy Christ\nvisited, He worked His first miracle to help men’s gladness.... ‘He who\nloves men loves their gladness, too’ ... He was always repeating that,\nit was one of his leading ideas.... ‘There’s no living without joy,’\nMitya says.... Yes, Mitya.... ‘Everything that is true and good is\nalways full of forgiveness,’ he used to say that, too” ...\n\n“_Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mine\nhour is not yet come._\n\n“_His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do\nit_” ...\n\n“Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people....\nOf course they were poor, since they hadn’t wine enough even at a\nwedding.... The historians write that, in those days, the people living\nabout the Lake of Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be\nimagined ... and another great heart, that other great being, His\nMother, knew that He had come not only to make His great terrible\nsacrifice. She knew that His heart was open even to the simple, artless\nmerrymaking of some obscure and unlearned people, who had warmly bidden\nHim to their poor wedding. ‘Mine hour is not yet come,’ He said, with a\nsoft smile (He must have smiled gently to her). And, indeed, was it to\nmake wine abundant at poor weddings He had come down to earth? And yet\nHe went and did as she asked Him.... Ah, he is reading again”....",
            "2": "“_Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled\nthem up to the brim._\n\n“_And he saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of\nthe feast. And they bare it._\n\n“_When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,\nand knew not whence it was; (but the servants which drew the water\nknew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,_\n\n“_And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good\nwine; and when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast\nkept the good wine until now._”\n\n“But what’s this, what’s this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah,\nyes ... It’s the marriage, the wedding ... yes, of course. Here are the\nguests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ...\nWhere is the wise governor of the feast? But who is this? Who? Again\nthe walls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great\ntable? What!... He here, too? But he’s in the coffin ... but he’s here,\ntoo. He has stood up, he sees me, he is coming here.... God!”...\n\nYes, he came up to him, to him, he, the little, thin old man, with tiny\nwrinkles on his face, joyful and laughing softly. There was no coffin\nnow, and he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with\nthem, when the visitors had gathered about him. His face was uncovered,\nhis eyes were shining. How was this, then? He, too, had been called to\nthe feast. He, too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee....\n\n“Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,” he heard a soft\nvoice saying over him. “Why have you hidden yourself here, out of\nsight? You come and join us too.”\n\nIt was his voice, the voice of Father Zossima. And it must be he, since\nhe called him!\n\nThe elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he rose from his knees.\n\n“We are rejoicing,” the little, thin old man went on. “We are drinking\nthe new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many\nguests? Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of\nthe feast, he is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me? I gave\nan onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only\nan onion each—only one little onion.... What are all our deeds? And\nyou, my gentle one, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a\nfamished woman an onion to‐day. Begin your work, dear one, begin it,\ngentle one!... Do you see our Sun, do you see Him?”\n\n“I am afraid ... I dare not look,” whispered Alyosha.",
            "3": "“Do not fear Him. He is terrible in His greatness, awful in His\nsublimity, but infinitely merciful. He has made Himself like unto us\nfrom love and rejoices with us. He is changing the water into wine that\nthe gladness of the guests may not be cut short. He is expecting new\nguests, He is calling new ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There\nthey are bringing new wine. Do you see they are bringing the\nvessels....”\n\nSomething glowed in Alyosha’s heart, something filled it till it ached,\ntears of rapture rose from his soul.... He stretched out his hands,\nuttered a cry and waked up.\n\nAgain the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct\nreading of the Gospel. But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. It\nwas strange, he had fallen asleep on his knees, but now he was on his\nfeet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid\nsteps he went right up to the coffin. His shoulder brushed against\nFather Païssy without his noticing it. Father Païssy raised his eyes\nfor an instant from his book, but looked away again at once, seeing\nthat something strange was happening to the boy. Alyosha gazed for half\na minute at the coffin, at the covered, motionless dead man that lay in\nthe coffin, with the ikon on his breast and the peaked cap with the\noctangular cross, on his head. He had only just been hearing his voice,\nand that voice was still ringing in his ears. He was listening, still\nexpecting other words, but suddenly he turned sharply and went out of\nthe cell.\n\nHe did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his soul,\noverflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. The\nvault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and\nfathomless above him. The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the\nzenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the\nearth. The white towers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out\nagainst the sapphire sky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds\nround the house, were slumbering till morning. The silence of earth\nseemed to melt into the silence of the heavens. The mystery of earth\nwas one with the mystery of the stars....",
            "4": "Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He\ndid not know why he embraced it. He could not have told why he longed\nso irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all. But he kissed it weeping,\nsobbing and watering it with his tears, and vowed passionately to love\nit, to love it for ever and ever. “Water the earth with the tears of\nyour joy and love those tears,” echoed in his soul.\n\nWhat was he weeping over?\n\nOh! in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars, which were\nshining to him from the abyss of space, and “he was not ashamed of that\necstasy.” There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds\nof God, linking his soul to them, and it was trembling all over “in\ncontact with other worlds.” He longed to forgive every one and for\neverything, and to beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all\nmen, for all and for everything. “And others are praying for me too,”\nechoed again in his soul. But with every instant he felt clearly and,\nas it were, tangibly, that something firm and unshakable as that vault\nof heaven had entered into his soul. It was as though some idea had\nseized the sovereignty of his mind—and it was for all his life and for\never and ever.

            "0": "But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her\nlast greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever,\nknew nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a\ncondition of feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he\nhad been in such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily\nhave fallen ill with brain fever, as he said himself afterwards.\nAlyosha had not been able to find him the morning before, and Ivan had\nnot succeeded in meeting him at the tavern on the same day. The people\nat his lodgings, by his orders, concealed his movements.\n\nHe had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions,\n“struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself,” as he\nexpressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he even made a dash\nout of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him to lose\nsight of Grushenka for a moment. All this was explained afterwards in\ndetail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we\nwill only note the most essential incidents of those two terrible days\nimmediately preceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly\nupon him.\n\nThough Grushenka had, it is true, loved him for an hour, genuinely and\nsincerely, yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly. The\nworst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do. To\nprevail upon her by force or kindness was also impossible: she would\nyield to nothing. She would only have become angry and turned away from\nhim altogether, he knew that well already. He suspected, quite\ncorrectly, that she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and\nwas in a state of extraordinary indecision, that she was making up her\nmind to something, and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without\ngood reason, he divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must\nsimply hate him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was\ndistressing Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole\ntormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch.",
            "1": "Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly\npersuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered,\nGrushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old\nvoluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya\nhad reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her\ncharacter. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all\nGrushenka’s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose,\nwhich was most to her advantage.\n\nStrange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of\nthe approaching return of the “officer,” that is, of the man who had\nbeen such a fatal influence in Grushenka’s life, and whose arrival she\nwas expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late\nGrushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of\na letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard\nof it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter\ncontained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter,\nbut to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It\nwould be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the\nhideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he\nwas incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for\nthe time. He simply did not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up\nagain after five years’ disappearance, still less in his speedy\narrival. Moreover, in the “officer’s” first letter which had been shown\nto Mitya, the possibility of his new rival’s visit was very vaguely\nsuggested. The letter was very indefinite, high‐flown, and full of\nsentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him\nthe last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more\ndefinitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered\nafterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from\nSiberia on Grushenka’s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had\npassed later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had\ncompletely forgotten the officer’s existence.",
            "2": "He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might\ntake, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and\nmust be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was\nexpecting every moment Grushenka’s decision, always believing that it\nwould come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she\nwould say to him: “Take me, I’m yours for ever,” and it would all be\nover. He would seize her and bear her away at once to the ends of the\nearth. Oh, then he would bear her away at once, as far, far away as\npossible; to the farthest end of Russia, if not of the earth, then he\nwould marry her, and settle down with her incognito, so that no one\nwould know anything about them, there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh,\nthen, a new life would begin at once!\n\nOf this different, reformed and “virtuous” life (“it must, it must be\nvirtuous”) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that\nreformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his\nown free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in\nsuch cases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were\nnot for these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if\nonly he could fly away from this accursed place—he would be altogether\nregenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in,\nand what he was yearning for.\n\nBut all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_\nsolution of the question. There was another possibility, a different\nand awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: “Go away. I have just\ncome to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don’t\nwant you”—and then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would\nhappen then. Up to the last hour he didn’t know. That must be said to\nhis credit. He had no definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was\nsimply watching and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the\nfirst, happy solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in\nfact. But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new,\nincidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.",
            "3": "If she were to say to him: “I’m yours; take me away,” how could he take\nher away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at\nthis time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles\nwhich had gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased.\nGrushenka had money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly\nevinced extraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the\nnew life with her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could\nnot conceive of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang\nof intense repulsion. I won’t enlarge on this fact or analyze it here,\nbut confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the\nmoment. All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the\nsecret stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that\nhe had dishonestly appropriated. “I’ve been a scoundrel to one of them,\nand I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,” was his\nfeeling then, as he explained after: “and when Grushenka knows, she\nwon’t care for such a scoundrel.”\n\nWhere then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful\nmoney? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, “and\nonly because I hadn’t the money. Oh, the shame of it!”",
            "4": "To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money,\nknew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this\nhere, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must\nexplain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he\nknew of, to _have the right_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina\nIvanovna’s three thousand—if not, “I’m a common pickpocket, I’m a\nscoundrel, and I don’t want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,” Mitya\ndecided. And so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return\nKaterina Ivanovna that three thousand, and that _first of all_. The\nfinal stage of this decision, so to say, had been reached only during\nthe last hours, that is, after his last interview with Alyosha, two\ndays before, on the high‐road, on the evening when Grushenka had\ninsulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha’s account\nof it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell\nKaterina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After parting\nfrom his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy that it would\nbe better “to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to\nKatya. I’d rather every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I’d\nrather go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that\nI deceived her and stole her money, and used her money to run away with\nGrushenka and begin a new life! That I can’t do!” So Mitya decided,\ngrinding his teeth, and he might well fancy at times that his brain\nwould give way. But meanwhile he went on struggling....",
            "5": "Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left\nfor him but despair—for what chance had he, with nothing in the world,\nto raise such a sum?—yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he\nwould get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him\nof itself, as though it might drop from heaven. That is just how it is\nwith people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money,\nexcept to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any\neffort of their own, and have no notion how money is obtained. A whirl\nof the most fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately\nafter he had parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his\nthoughts into a tangle of confusion. This is how it was he pitched\nfirst on a perfectly wild enterprise. And perhaps to men of that kind\nin such circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur\nfirst, and seem most practical.\n\nHe suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was\nGrushenka’s protector, and to propose a “scheme” to him, and by means\nof it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum required. Of the\ncommercial value of his scheme he had no doubt, not the slightest, and\nwas only uncertain how Samsonov would look upon his freak, supposing he\nwere to consider it from any but the commercial point of view. Though\nMitya knew the merchant by sight, he was not acquainted with him and\nhad never spoken a word to him. But for some unknown reason he had long\nentertained the conviction that the old reprobate, who was lying at\ndeath’s door, would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka’s\nsecuring a respectable position, and marrying a man “to be depended\nupon.” And he believed not only that he would not object, but that this\nwas what he desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he would be ready\nto help. From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of\nGrushenka’s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps\nprefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.",
            "6": "Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on\nsuch assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from\nthe hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of\ndelicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka’s past\nas something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity\nand resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once\nGrushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the\nbeginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice.\nThey would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As\nfor Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a\nfateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka’s, though she had\nnever loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past,\ncompletely done with, and, so to say, non‐existent. Besides, Mitya\nhardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one\nin the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with\nGrushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and\nthat this had been so for a long time.\n\nIn any case there was much simplicity on Mitya’s part in all this, for\nin spite of all his vices, he was a very simple‐hearted man. It was an\ninstance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that,\nbeing on the eve of his departure for the next world, old Kuzma must\nsincerely repent of his past relations with Grushenka, and that she had\nno more devoted friend and protector in the world than this, now\nharmless old man.\n\nAfter his conversation with Alyosha, at the cross‐roads, he hardly\nslept all night, and at ten o’clock next morning, he was at the house\nof Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him. It was a very\nlarge and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses.\nIn the lower story lived Samsonov’s two married sons with their\nfamilies, his old sister, and his unmarried daughter. In the lodge\nlived two of his clerks, one of whom also had a large family. Both the\nlodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but the old man kept the\nupper floor to himself, and would not even let the daughter live there\nwith him, though she waited upon him, and in spite of her asthma was\nobliged at certain fixed hours, and at any time he might call her, to\nrun upstairs to him from below.",
            "7": "This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for\nshow, furnished in the old‐fashioned merchant style, with long\nmonotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass\nchandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls. All these\nrooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man kept to one room,\na small, remote bedroom, where he was waited upon by an old servant\nwith a kerchief on her head, and by a lad, who used to sit on the\nlocker in the passage. Owing to his swollen legs, the old man could\nhardly walk at all, and was only rarely lifted from his leather\narm‐chair, when the old woman supporting him led him up and down the\nroom once or twice. He was morose and taciturn even with this old\nwoman.\n\nWhen he was informed of the arrival of the “captain,” he at once\nrefused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up again.\nSamsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked like? Whether he\nwas drunk? Was he going to make a row? The answer he received was: that\nhe was sober, but wouldn’t go away. The old man again refused to see\nhim. Then Mitya, who had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil\nand paper with him, wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: “On\nmost important business closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,” and\nsent it up to the old man.\n\nAfter thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to\nthe drawing‐room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to\nhis younger son to come upstairs to him at once. This younger son, a\nman over six foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was\nclosely‐shaven and dressed in the European style, though his father\nstill wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once without a comment. All\nthe family trembled before the father. The old man had sent for this\ngiant, not because he was afraid of the “captain” (he was by no means\nof a timorous temper), but in order to have a witness in case of any\nemergency. Supported by his son and the servant‐lad, he waddled at last\ninto the drawing‐room. It may be assumed that he felt considerable\ncuriosity. The drawing‐room in which Mitya was awaiting him was a vast,\ndreary room that laid a weight of depression on the heart. It had a\ndouble row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense\nchandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.",
            "8": "Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his fate\nwith nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the opposite\ndoor, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his long,\nmilitary stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well dressed, in a\nfrock‐coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his\nhands, just as he had been three days before at the elder’s, at the\nfamily meeting with his father and brothers. The old man waited for\nhim, standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya felt at once that he\nhad looked him through and through as he advanced. Mitya was greatly\nimpressed, too, with Samsonov’s immensely swollen face. His lower lip,\nwhich had always been thick, hung down now, looking like a bun. He\nbowed to his guest in dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by\nthe sofa, and, leaning on his son’s arm he began lowering himself on to\nthe sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his\npainful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively\nconscious of his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person\nhe had ventured to disturb.\n\n“What is it you want of me, sir?” said the old man, deliberately,\ndistinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last seated.\n\nMitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at once\nspeaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive\nfrenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of\nruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he failed. Old\nSamsonov probably grasped all this in an instant, though his face\nremained cold and immovable as a statue’s.\n\n“Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than\nonce of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who\nrobbed me of my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is\ngossiping about it ... for here every one’s gossiping of what they\nshouldn’t ... and besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka\n... I beg your pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ... Agrafena\nAlexandrovna, the lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem\n...”",
            "9": "So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will not\nreproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of\nit. Three months ago, he said, he had of express intention (Mitya\npurposely used these words instead of “intentionally”) consulted a\nlawyer in the chief town of the province, “a distinguished lawyer,\nKuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov. You have perhaps heard of\nhim? A man of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you,\ntoo ... spoke of you in the highest terms ...” Mitya broke down again.\nBut these breaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps,\nand struggled on and on.\n\nThis Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and inspecting the\ndocuments he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to\nthese documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste),\nreported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the\nvillage of Tchermashnya, which ought, he said, to have come to him,\nMitya, from his mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his father\n... “because every door was not closed and justice might still find a\nloophole.” In fact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even\nseven thousand roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was\nworth, at least, twenty‐five thousand, he might say twenty‐eight\nthousand, in fact, “thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you\nbelieve it, I didn’t get seventeen from that heartless man!” So he,\nMitya, had thrown the business up, for the time, knowing nothing about\nthe law, but on coming here was struck dumb by a cross‐claim made upon\nhim (here Mitya went adrift again and again took a flying leap\nforward), “so will not you, excellent and honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be\nwilling to take up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and\npay me a sum down of only three thousand?... You see, you cannot, in\nany case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite the\ncontrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three.” Above\nall, he wanted this concluded that very day.",
            "10": "“I’ll do the business with you at a notary’s, or whatever it is ... in\nfact, I’m ready to do anything.... I’ll hand over all the deeds ...\nwhatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement\nat once ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that\nvery morning.... You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn’t\na capitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me\nfrom ... would save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an\nhonorable action.... For I cherish the most honorable feelings for a\ncertain person, whom you know well, and care for as a father. I would\nnot have come, indeed, if it had not been as a father. And, indeed,\nit’s a struggle of three in this business, for it’s fate—that’s a\nfearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy!\nAnd as you’ve dropped out long ago, it’s a tug‐ of‐war between two. I’m\nexpressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I’m not a literary man. You see,\nI’m on the one side, and that monster on the other. So you must choose.\nIt’s either I or the monster. It all lies in your hands—the fate of\nthree lives, and the happiness of two.... Excuse me, I’m making a mess\nof it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that you\nunderstand ... and if you don’t understand, I’m done for ... so you\nsee!”\n\nMitya broke off his clumsy speech with that, “so you see!” and jumping\nup from his seat, awaited the answer to his foolish proposal. At the\nlast phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all\nfallen flat, above all, that he had been talking utter nonsense.\n\n“How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it’s\nnothing but nonsense.” The idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind.\nAll the while he had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching\nhim with an icy expression in his eyes. After keeping him for a moment\nin suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and\nchilling tone:\n\n“Excuse me, we don’t undertake such business.”\n\nMitya suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him.\n\n“What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” he muttered, with a pale smile.\n“I suppose it’s all up with me—what do you think?”\n\n“Excuse me....”\n\nMitya remained standing, staring motionless. He suddenly noticed a\nmovement in the old man’s face. He started.",
            "11": "“You see, sir, business of that sort’s not in our line,” said the old\nman slowly. “There’s the court, and the lawyers—it’s a perfect misery.\nBut if you like, there is a man here you might apply to.”\n\n“Good heavens! Who is it? You’re my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,”\nfaltered Mitya.\n\n“He doesn’t live here, and he’s not here just now. He is a peasant, he\ndoes business in timber. His name is Lyagavy. He’s been haggling with\nFyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya.\nThey can’t agree on the price, maybe you’ve heard? Now he’s come back\nagain and is staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts\nfrom the Volovya station. He wrote to me, too, about the business of\nthe copse, asking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him\nhimself. So if you were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to\nmake Lyagavy the offer you’ve made me, he might possibly—”\n\n“A brilliant idea!” Mitya interrupted ecstatically. “He’s the very man,\nit would just suit him. He’s haggling with him for it, being asked too\nmuch, and here he would have all the documents entitling him to the\nproperty itself. Ha ha ha!”\n\nAnd Mitya suddenly went off into his short, wooden laugh, startling\nSamsonov.\n\n“How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch?” cried Mitya effusively.\n\n“Don’t mention it,” said Samsonov, inclining his head.\n\n“But you don’t know, you’ve saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment\nbrought me to you.... So now to this priest!”\n\n“No need of thanks.”\n\n“I’ll make haste and fly there. I’m afraid I’ve overtaxed your\nstrength. I shall never forget it. It’s a Russian says that, Kuzma\nKuzmitch, a R‐r‐ russian!”\n\n“To be sure!”\n\nMitya seized his hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in\nthe old man’s eye. Mitya drew back his hand, but at once blamed himself\nfor his mistrustfulness.\n\n“It’s because he’s tired,” he thought.\n\n“For her sake! For her sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it’s\nfor her,” he cried, his voice ringing through the room. He bowed,\nturned sharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door\nwithout looking back. He was trembling with delight.",
            "12": "“Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,”\nwas the thought in his mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov (a\nmost worthy old man, and what dignity!) had suggested this course, then\n... then success was assured. He would fly off immediately. “I will be\nback before night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done.\nCould the old man have been laughing at me?” exclaimed Mitya, as he\nstrode towards his lodging. He could, of course, imagine nothing, but\nthat the advice was practical “from such a business man” with an\nunderstanding of the business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy\n(curious surname!). Or—the old man was laughing at him.\n\nAlas! The second alternative was the correct one. Long afterwards, when\nthe catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing,\nthat he had made a fool of the “captain.” He was a cold, spiteful and\nsarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies. Whether it was the\n“captain’s” excited face, or the foolish conviction of the “rake and\nspendthrift,” that he, Samsonov, could be taken in by such a\ncock‐and‐bull story as his scheme, or his jealousy of Grushenka, in\nwhose name this “scapegrace” had rushed in on him with such a tale to\nget money which worked on the old man, I can’t tell. But at the instant\nwhen Mitya stood before him, feeling his legs grow weak under him, and\nfrantically exclaiming that he was ruined, at that moment the old man\nlooked at him with intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing‐stock\nof him. When Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to\nhis son and bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again,\nand never admitted even into the yard, or else he’d—\n\nHe did not utter his threat. But even his son, who often saw him\nenraged, trembled with fear. For a whole hour afterwards, the old man\nwas shaking with anger, and by evening he was worse, and sent for the\ndoctor."

            "0": "So he must drive at full speed, and he had not the money for horses. He\nhad forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many\nyears of prosperity! But he had at home an old silver watch which had\nlong ceased to go. He snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish\nwatchmaker who had a shop in the market‐place. The Jew gave him six\nroubles for it.\n\n“And I didn’t expect that,” cried Mitya, ecstatically. (He was still in\na state of ecstasy.) He seized his six roubles and ran home. At home he\nborrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him so\nmuch that they were pleased to give it him, though it was all they had.\nMitya in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be\ndecided that day, and he described, in desperate haste, the whole\nscheme he had put before Samsonov, the latter’s decision, his own hopes\nfor the future, and so on. These people had been told many of their\nlodger’s secrets before, and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was\nnot at all proud, and almost one of themselves. Having thus collected\nnine roubles Mitya sent for posting‐horses to take him to the Volovya\nstation. This was how the fact came to be remembered and established\nthat “at midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing,\nand that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three\nroubles from his landlord, all in the presence of witnesses.”\n\nI note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.\n\nThough he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at\nlast solve all his difficulties, yet, as he drew near Volovya station,\nhe trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his\nabsence. What if she made up her mind to‐day to go to Fyodor\nPavlovitch? This was why he had gone off without telling her and why he\nleft orders with his landlady not to let out where he had gone, if any\none came to inquire for him.\n\n“I must, I must get back to‐night,” he repeated, as he was jolted along\nin the cart, “and I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back\nhere ... to draw up the deed.” So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart,\nbut alas! his dreams were not fated to be carried out.\n\nTo begin with, he was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station\nwhich turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve. Secondly, he\ndid not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had gone off to a\nneighboring village. While Mitya, setting off there with the same\nexhausted horses, was looking for him, it was almost dark.",
            "1": "The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him at once\nthat though Lyagavy had been staying with him at first, he was now at\nSuhoy Possyolok, that he was staying the night in the forester’s\ncottage, as he was buying timber there too. At Mitya’s urgent request\nthat he would take him to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing “save him,\nso to speak,” the priest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him to\nSuhoy Possyolok; his curiosity was obviously aroused. But, unluckily,\nhe advised their going on foot, as it would not be “much over” a verst.\nMitya, of course, agreed, and marched off with his yard‐long strides,\nso that the poor priest almost ran after him. He was a very cautious\nman, though not old.\n\nMitya at once began talking to him, too, of his plans, nervously and\nexcitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way.\nThe priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He turned off\nMitya’s questions with: “I don’t know. Ah, I can’t say. How can I\ntell?” and so on. When Mitya began to speak of his quarrel with his\nfather over his inheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he\nwas in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch. He inquired, however,\nwith surprise, why he called the peasant‐trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and\nobligingly explained to Mitya that, though the man’s name really was\nLyagavy, he was never called so, as he would be grievously offended at\nthe name, and that he must be sure to call him Gorstkin, “or you’ll do\nnothing with him; he won’t even listen to you,” said the priest in\nconclusion.\n\nMitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was\nwhat Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact, the priest dropped\nthe subject, though he would have done well to put into words his doubt\nwhether, if Samsonov had sent him to that peasant, calling him Lyagavy,\nthere was not something wrong about it and he was turning him into\nridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. He hurried,\nstriding along, and only when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize\nthat they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least\nthree. This annoyed him, but he controlled himself.",
            "2": "They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and\nGorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the other side of\nthe passage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The\nhut was extremely overheated. On the table there was a samovar that had\ngone out, a tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka\npartly full, and some half‐eaten crusts of wheaten bread. The visitor\nhimself lay stretched at full length on the bench, with his coat\ncrushed up under his head for a pillow, snoring heavily. Mitya stood in\nperplexity.\n\n“Of course I must wake him. My business is too important. I’ve come in\nsuch haste. I’m in a hurry to get back to‐day,” he said in great\nagitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving\ntheir opinion. Mitya went up and began trying to wake him himself; he\ntried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake.\n\n“He’s drunk,” Mitya decided. “Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I to\ndo?” And, terribly impatient, he began pulling him by the arms, by the\nlegs, shaking his head, lifting him up and making him sit on the bench.\nYet, after prolonged exertions, he could only succeed in getting the\ndrunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate\noaths.\n\n“No, you’d better wait a little,” the priest pronounced at last, “for\nhe’s obviously not in a fit state.”\n\n“He’s been drinking the whole day,” the forester chimed in.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried Mitya. “If only you knew how important it is to\nme and how desperate I am!”\n\n“No, you’d better wait till morning,” the priest repeated.\n\n“Till morning? Mercy! that’s impossible!”\n\nAnd in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man\nagain, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his\nefforts. The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.\n\n“What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,” said Mitya,\nin complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his face. The\npriest seized the moment to put before him, very reasonably, that, even\nif he succeeded in wakening the man, he would still be drunk and\nincapable of conversation. “And your business is important,” he said,\n“so you’d certainly better put it off till morning.” With a gesture of\ndespair Mitya agreed.",
            "3": "“Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment.\nAs soon as he wakes I’ll begin. I’ll pay you for the light,” he said to\nthe forester, “for the night’s lodging, too; you’ll remember Dmitri\nKaramazov. Only, Father, I don’t know what we’re to do with you. Where\nwill you sleep?”\n\n“No, I’m going home. I’ll take his horse and get home,” he said,\nindicating the forester. “And now I’ll say good‐by. I wish you all\nsuccess.”\n\nSo it was settled. The priest rode off on the forester’s horse,\ndelighted to escape, though he shook his head uneasily, wondering\nwhether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor Fyodor\nPavlovitch of this curious incident, “or he may in an unlucky hour hear\nof it, be angry, and withdraw his favor.”\n\nThe forester, scratching himself, went back to his room without a word,\nand Mitya sat on the bench to “catch the favorable moment,” as he\nexpressed it. Profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy\nmist. A profound, intense dejection! He sat thinking, but could reach\nno conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became\ninsufferably close in the overheated room. He suddenly pictured the\ngarden, the path behind the garden, the door of his father’s house\nmysteriously opening and Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the\nbench.\n\n“It’s a tragedy!” he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he went up\nto the sleeping man and looked in his face. He was a lean, middle‐aged\npeasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish\nbeard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the\npocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch. Mitya looked at his\nface with intense hatred, and for some unknown reason his curly hair\nparticularly irritated him.\n\nWhat was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of\nsuch importance and making such sacrifices, he, Mitya, utterly worn\nout, should with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on\nwhom his whole fate depended, while he snored as though there were\nnothing the matter, as though he’d dropped from another planet.\n\n“Oh, the irony of fate!” cried Mitya, and, quite losing his head, he\nfell again to rousing the tipsy peasant. He roused him with a sort of\nferocity, pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but after five\nminutes of vain exertions, he returned to his bench in helpless\ndespair, and sat down.",
            "4": "“Stupid! Stupid!” cried Mitya. “And how dishonorable it all is!”\nsomething made him add. His head began to ache horribly. “Should he\nfling it up and go away altogether?” he wondered. “No, wait till\nto‐morrow now. I’ll stay on purpose. What else did I come for? Besides,\nI’ve no means of going. How am I to get away from here now? Oh, the\nidiocy of it!”\n\nBut his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and\nunconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have\nslept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head aching so\nunbearably that he could have screamed. There was a hammering in his\ntemples, and the top of his head ached. It was a long time before he\ncould wake up fully and understand what had happened to him.\n\nAt last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the\nstove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant\nstill lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya\ncried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester’s\nroom. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room\nwas full of fumes, to Mitya’s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact\nwith strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it.\n\n“But he’s dead, he’s dead! and ... what am I to do then?” cried Mitya\nfrantically.\n\nThey threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya\nbrought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head,\nthen, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it\non Lyagavy’s head. The forester still treated the matter\ncontemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily:\n\n“It’ll be all right, now.”\n\nHe went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed\nabout the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and\ngravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that\nwhen he sat down for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes,\nunconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like\nthe dead.",
            "5": "It was dreadfully late when he waked. It was somewhere about nine\no’clock. The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the\nhut. The curly‐headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat\non. He had another samovar and another bottle in front of him.\nYesterday’s bottle had already been finished, and the new one was more\nthan half empty. Mitya jumped up and saw at once that the cursed\npeasant was drunk again, hopelessly and incurably. He stared at him for\na moment with wide opened eyes. The peasant was silently and slyly\nwatching him, with insulting composure, and even a sort of contemptuous\ncondescension, so Mitya fancied. He rushed up to him.\n\n“Excuse me, you see ... I ... you’ve most likely heard from the\nforester here in the hut. I’m Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of\nthe old Karamazov whose copse you are buying.”\n\n“That’s a lie!” said the peasant, calmly and confidently.\n\n“A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?”\n\n“I don’t know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,” said the peasant,\nspeaking thickly.\n\n“You’re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up,\nand collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You\nwrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,” Mitya gasped\nbreathlessly.\n\n“You’re l‐lying!” Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya’s legs went cold.\n\n“For mercy’s sake! It isn’t a joke! You’re drunk, perhaps. Yet you can\nspeak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!”\n\n“You’re a painter!”\n\n“For mercy’s sake! I’m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to\nmake you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning\nthe copse!”\n\nThe peasant stroked his beard importantly.\n\n“No, you’ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You’re a\nscoundrel!”\n\n“I assure you you’re mistaken,” cried Mitya, wringing his hands in\ndespair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up\nhis eyes cunningly.\n\n“No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D’you\nhear? You’re a scoundrel! Do you understand that?”\n\nMitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly “something seemed to hit him\non the head,” as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to\ndawn in his mind, “a light was kindled and I grasped it all.” He stood,\nstupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could\nhave yielded to such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and\nhave kept it up for almost twenty‐four hours, fussing round this\nLyagavy, wetting his head.",
            "6": "“Why, the man’s drunk, dead drunk, and he’ll go on drinking now for a\nweek; what’s the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here\non purpose? What if she—? Oh, God, what have I done?”\n\nThe peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might\nhave killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He\nwent quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a\nword, and went out of the hut. He did not find the forester in the next\nroom; there was no one there. He took fifty kopecks in small change out\nof his pocket and put them on the table for his night’s lodging, the\ncandle, and the trouble he had given. Coming out of the hut he saw\nnothing but forest all round. He walked at hazard, not knowing which\nway to turn out of the hut, to the right or to the left. Hurrying there\nthe evening before with the priest, he had not noticed the road. He had\nno revengeful feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his heart. He\nstrode along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding\nwhere he was going. A child could have knocked him down, so weak was he\nin body and soul. He got out of the forest somehow, however, and a\nvista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the eye\ncould see.\n\n“What despair! What death all round!” he repeated, striding on and on.",
            "7": "He was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across\ncountry in a hired trap. When he overtook him, Mitya asked the way, and\nit turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya. After\nsome discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they\narrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered posting‐horses to drive to\nthe town, and suddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry. While\nthe horses were being harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him. He\nate it all in an instant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and\nswallowed three glasses of vodka. After eating, his spirits and his\nheart grew lighter. He flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and\nsuddenly made a new and “unalterable” plan to procure that “accursed\nmoney” before evening. “And to think, only to think that a man’s life\nshould be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!” he cried,\ncontemptuously. “I’ll settle it to‐ day.” And if it had not been for\nthe thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her, which\nnever left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful again....\nBut the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every moment, like\na sharp knife.\n\nAt last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka."

            "0": "This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin\nwith such horror. She was just then expecting the “message,” and was\nmuch relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day\nbefore. She hoped that “please God he won’t come till I’m gone away,”\nand he suddenly burst in on her. The rest we know already. To get him\noff her hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to\nSamsonov’s, where she said she absolutely must go “to settle his\naccounts,” and when Mitya accompanied her at once, she said good‐by to\nhim at the gate, making him promise to come at twelve o’clock to take\nher home again. Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. If she\nwas sitting at Samsonov’s she could not be going to Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s, “if only she’s not lying,” he added at once. But he\nthought she was not lying from what he saw.\n\nHe was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved\nwoman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be\nhappening to her, and how she may be betraying him, but, when shaken,\nheartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he runs back to her; at\nthe first glance at her face, her gay, laughing, affectionate face, he\nrevives at once, lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses\nhimself for his jealousy.\n\nAfter leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much\nstill to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his heart,\nanyway.\n\n“Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether\nanything happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she went to\nFyodor Pavlovitch; ough!” floated through his mind.\n\nBefore he had time to reach his lodging, jealousy had surged up again\nin his restless heart.",
            "1": "Jealousy! “Othello was not jealous, he was trustful,” observed Pushkin.\nAnd that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great\npoet. Othello’s soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply\nbecause _his ideal was destroyed_. But Othello did not begin hiding,\nspying, peeping. He was trustful, on the contrary. He had to be led up,\npushed on, excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the\nidea of deceit. The truly jealous man is not like that. It is\nimpossible to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to\nwhich the jealous man can descend without a qualm of conscience. And\nyet it’s not as though the jealous were all vulgar and base souls. On\nthe contrary, a man of lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of\nself‐sacrifice, may yet hide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and\nbe familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.\n\nOthello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness—not\nincapable of forgiving it, but of making up his mind to it—though his\nsoul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe’s. It is not so\nwith the really jealous man. It is hard to imagine what some jealous\nmen can make up their mind to and overlook, and what they can forgive!\nThe jealous are the readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it.\nThe jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly (though, of course,\nafter a violent scene), and he is able to forgive infidelity almost\nconclusively proved, the very kisses and embraces he has seen, if only\nhe can somehow be convinced that it has all been “for the last time,”\nand that his rival will vanish from that day forward, will depart to\nthe ends of the earth, or that he himself will carry her away\nsomewhere, where that dreaded rival will not get near her. Of course\nthe reconciliation is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did\ndisappear next day, he would invent another one and would be jealous of\nhim. And one might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so\nwatched over, what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous\nguarding. But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among\nthem are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those very\nmen of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and\nspying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway,\nthough they understand clearly enough with their “noble hearts” the\nshameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.",
            "2": "At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya’s jealousy vanished, and, for an\ninstant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised\nhimself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for\nthe woman, there was an element of something far higher than he himself\nimagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only the “curve\nof her body,” of which he had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as\nGrushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all the low cunning\nof faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience at it.\n\nAnd so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make\nhaste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small,\ntemporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his\nexpedition. And, as we all know, one can’t take a step without money.\nBut he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a\nbrace of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till\nthen because he prized them above all his possessions.\n\nIn the “Metropolis” tavern he had some time since made acquaintance\nwith a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor\nwas passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers,\ndaggers, hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He\nprided himself on them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of\nthe revolver. Mitya, without stopping to think, went straight to him,\nand offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten roubles. The official,\ndelighted, began trying to persuade him to sell them outright. But\nMitya would not consent, so the young man gave him ten roubles,\nprotesting that nothing would induce him to take interest. They parted\nfriends.\n\nMitya was in haste; he rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch’s by the back\nway, to his arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible. In\nthis way the fact was established that three or four hours before a\ncertain event, of which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a\nfarthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession he valued, though,\nthree hours later, he was in possession of thousands.... But I am\nanticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna (the woman living near Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s) he learned the very disturbing fact of Smerdyakov’s\nillness. He heard the story of his fall in the cellar, his fit, the\ndoctor’s visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s anxiety; he heard with interest,\ntoo, that his brother Ivan had set off that morning for Moscow.",
            "3": "“Then he must have driven through Volovya before me,” thought Dmitri,\nbut he was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. “What will happen now?\nWho’ll keep watch for me? Who’ll bring me word?” he thought. He began\ngreedily questioning the women whether they had seen anything the\nevening before. They quite understood what he was trying to find out,\nand completely reassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch\nhad been there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya\ngrew thoughtful. He would certainly have to keep watch to‐day, but\nwhere? Here or at Samsonov’s gate? He decided that he must be on the\nlook out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The\ndifficulty was that he had to carry out the new plan that he had made\non the journey back. He was sure of its success, but he must not delay\nacting upon it. Mitya resolved to sacrifice an hour to it: “In an hour\nI shall know everything, I shall settle everything, and then, then,\nfirst of all to Samsonov’s. I’ll inquire whether Grushenka’s there and\ninstantly be back here again, stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov’s\nagain to bring her home.” This was what he decided.\n\nHe flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed,\nand went to Madame Hohlakov’s. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He\nhad resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was\nmore, he felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it\nto him. It may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone\nto her at first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to\nSamsonov, a man he did not know, who was not of his own class, and to\nwhom he hardly knew how to speak.",
            "4": "But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had\nseen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not\nendure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged\nto Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly\nconceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and\nmarry the “charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent\nmanners.” Mitya’s manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at\nher, and had once said about her that she was just as lively and at her\nease as she was uncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant\nidea had struck him: “If she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina\nIvanovna” (and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject)\n“why should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to\nleave Katya and get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies,\nif they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy\ntheir caprice. Besides, she’s so rich,” Mitya argued.\n\nAs for his “plan” it was just the same as before; it consisted of the\noffer of his rights to Tchermashnya—but not with a commercial object,\nas it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the\npossibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand—but simply as a\nsecurity for the debt. As he worked out this new idea, Mitya was\nenchanted with it, but so it always was with him in all his\nundertakings, in all his sudden decisions. He gave himself up to every\nnew idea with passionate enthusiasm. Yet, when he mounted the steps of\nMadame Hohlakov’s house he felt a shiver of fear run down his spine. At\nthat moment he saw fully, as a mathematical certainty, that this was\nhis last hope, that if this broke down, nothing else was left him in\nthe world, but to “rob and murder some one for the three thousand.” It\nwas half‐past seven when he rang at the bell.\n\nAt first fortune seemed to smile upon him. As soon as he was announced\nhe was received with extraordinary rapidity. “As though she were\nwaiting for me,” thought Mitya, and as soon as he had been led to the\ndrawing‐room, the lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at\nonce that she was expecting him.\n\n“I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I’d no reason to\nsuppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself. Yet, I\ndid expect you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but\nI was convinced all the morning that you would come.”",
            "5": "“That is certainly wonderful, madam,” observed Mitya, sitting down\nlimply, “but I have come to you on a matter of great importance.... On\na matter of supreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone\n... and I hasten—”\n\n“I know you’ve come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch;\nit’s not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the\nmiraculous (have you heard about Father Zossima?). This is a case of\nmathematics: you couldn’t help coming, after all that has passed with\nKaterina Ivanovna; you couldn’t, you couldn’t, that’s a mathematical\ncertainty.”\n\n“The realism of actual life, madam, that’s what it is. But allow me to\nexplain—”\n\n“Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I’m all for realism now. I’ve\nseen too much of miracles. You’ve heard that Father Zossima is dead?”\n\n“No, madam, it’s the first time I’ve heard of it.” Mitya was a little\nsurprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind.\n\n“Last night, and only imagine—”\n\n“Madam,” said Mitya, “I can imagine nothing except that I’m in a\ndesperate position, and that if you don’t help me, everything will come\nto grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the\nexpression, but I’m in a fever—”\n\n“I know, I know that you’re in a fever. You could hardly fail to be,\nand whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been\nthinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it\nand studying it.... Oh, believe me, I’m an experienced doctor of the\nsoul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I’m certainly an experienced\npatient,” said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, “and I feel that if\nyou are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help\nin my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with\nwhich I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of\nyou.... I have come, madam—”\n\n“Don’t explain it. It’s of secondary importance. But as for help,\nyou’re not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most\nlikely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined,\n‘had come to grief,’ as you characteristically express it, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to horse‐breeding, and now he’s\ndoing well. Have you any idea of horse‐breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”",
            "6": "“Not the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!” cried Mitya, in\nnervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. “I simply\nimplore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free\nspeech that I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with\nwhich I have come. Besides, I am short of time. I’m in a fearful\nhurry,” Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that she was just going to\nbegin talking again, and hoping to cut her short. “I have come in\ndespair ... in the last gasp of despair, to beg you to lend me the sum\nof three thousand, a loan, but on safe, most safe security, madam, with\nthe most trustworthy guarantees! Only let me explain—”\n\n“You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!” Madame Hohlakov\nwith a gesture demanded silence in her turn, “and whatever you may tell\nme, I know it all beforehand; I’ve told you so already. You ask for a\ncertain sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably\nmore, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.”\n\nMitya started from his seat again.\n\n“Madam, will you really be so good!” he cried, with strong feeling.\n“Good God, you’ve saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death,\nfrom a bullet.... My eternal gratitude—”\n\n“I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!” cried\nMadame Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya’s ecstasy.\n\n“Infinitely? But I don’t need so much. I only need that fatal three\nthousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite\ngratitude, and I propose a plan which—”\n\n“Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it’s said and done.” Madame Hohlakov cut\nhim short, with the modest triumph of beneficence: “I have promised to\nsave you, and I will save you. I will save you as I did Belmesov. What\ndo you think of the gold‐mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”\n\n“Of the gold‐mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.”\n\n“But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over\nagain. I have been watching you for the last month. I’ve watched you a\nhundred times as you’ve walked past, saying to myself: that’s a man of\nenergy who ought to be at the gold‐mines. I’ve studied your gait and\ncome to the conclusion: that’s a man who would find gold.”\n\n“From my gait, madam?” said Mitya, smiling.",
            "7": "“Yes, from your gait. You surely don’t deny that character can be told\nfrom the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea. I’m all\nfor science and realism now. After all this business with Father\nZossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I’m a realist and I\nwant to devote myself to practical usefulness. I’m cured. ‘Enough!’ as\nTurgenev says.”\n\n“But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me—”\n\n“It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov cut in at once.\n“The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three\nmillion, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I’ll make you a\npresent of the idea: you shall find gold‐mines, make millions, return\nand become a leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things.\nAre we to leave it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and\nenterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless\nyou. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You’ll become\nfamous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so\nbadly off at present. The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at\nnight, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; people don’t know that side of me—”\n\n“Madam, madam!” Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. “I\nshall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam....\nI shall perhaps set off ... to the gold‐mines.... I’ll come and see you\nagain about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand\nyou so generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could\nto‐day ... you see, I haven’t a minute, a minute to lose to‐day—”\n\n“Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!” Madame Hohlakov interrupted\nemphatically. “The question is, will you go to the gold‐mines or not;\nhave you quite made up your mind? Answer yes or no.”\n\n“I will go, madam, afterwards.... I’ll go where you like ... but now—”\n\n“Wait!” cried Madame Hohlakov. And jumping up and running to a handsome\nbureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer\nafter another, looking for something with desperate haste.\n\n“The three thousand,” thought Mitya, his heart almost stopping, “and at\nthe instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that’s doing\nthings in gentlemanly style! She’s a splendid woman, if only she didn’t\ntalk so much!”\n\n“Here!” cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, “here is\nwhat I was looking for!”\n\nIt was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the\nskin with a cross.",
            "8": "“This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” she went on reverently, “from\nthe relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put it on your neck\nmyself, and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.”\n\nAnd she actually put the cord round his neck, and began arranging it.\nIn extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her, and at last\nhe got it under his neck‐tie and collar through his shirt to his chest.\n\n“Now you can set off,” Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down\ntriumphantly in her place again.\n\n“Madam, I am so touched. I don’t know how to thank you, indeed ... for\nsuch kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....\nThat sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity....\nOh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,” Mitya\nexclaimed impulsively, “then let me reveal to you ... though, of\ncourse, you’ve known it a long time ... that I love somebody here.... I\nhave been false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh,\nI’ve behaved inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here\nwith another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for\nyou know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any account,\nand therefore that three thousand now—”\n\n“Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” Madame Hohlakov interrupted in\nthe most decisive tone. “Leave everything, especially women. Gold‐mines\nare your goal, and there’s no place for women there. Afterwards, when\nyou come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in\nthe highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education\nand advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have\ngained ground, and the new woman will have appeared.”\n\n“Madam, that’s not the point, not at all....” Mitya clasped his hands\nin entreaty.",
            "9": "“Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing\nyou’re yearning for, though you don’t realize it yourself. I am not at\nall opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The\ndevelopment of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in\nthe near future—that’s my ideal. I’ve a daughter myself, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, people don’t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to\nthe author, Shtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so\nmuch about the vocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous\nletter of two lines: ‘I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the\nmodern woman. Persevere.’ And I signed myself, ‘A Mother.’ I thought of\nsigning myself ‘A contemporary Mother,’ and hesitated, but I stuck to\nthe simple ‘Mother’; there’s more moral beauty in that, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. And the word ‘contemporary’ might have reminded him of\n‘_The Contemporary_’—a painful recollection owing to the censorship....\nGood Heavens, what is the matter!”\n\n“Madam!” cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his hands before her\nin helpless entreaty. “You will make me weep if you delay what you have\nso generously—”\n\n“Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep! That’s a noble feeling ...\nsuch a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later\non you will return rejoicing. You will hasten to me from Siberia on\npurpose to share your joy with me—”\n\n“But allow me, too!” Mitya cried suddenly. “For the last time I entreat\nyou, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to‐day, if not, when\nmay I come for it?”\n\n“What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?”\n\n“The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously—”\n\n“Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven’t got three thousand,” Madame\nHohlakov announced with serene amazement. Mitya was stupefied.\n\n“Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in\nmy hands—”\n\n“Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you\nmisunderstood me. I was talking of the gold‐mines. It’s true I promised\nyou more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now,\nbut I was referring to the gold‐mines.”\n\n“But the money? The three thousand?” Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly.",
            "10": "“Oh, if you meant money, I haven’t any. I haven’t a penny, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. I’m quarreling with my steward about it, and I’ve just\nborrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself. No, no, I’ve no\nmoney. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn’t give\nit to you. In the first place I never lend money. Lending money means\nlosing friends. And I wouldn’t give it to you particularly. I wouldn’t\ngive it you, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need\nis the gold‐mines, the gold‐mines, the gold‐mines!”\n\n“Oh, the devil!” roared Mitya, and with all his might brought his fist\ndown on the table.\n\n“Aie! Aie!” cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she flew to the other\nend of the drawing‐room.\n\nMitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of\nthe house, into the street, into the darkness! He walked like one\npossessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he had\nstruck himself two days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he\nsaw him in the dark, on the road. What those blows upon his breast\nsignified, _on that spot_, and what he meant by it—that was, for the\ntime, a secret which was known to no one in the world, and had not been\ntold even to Alyosha. But that secret meant for him more than disgrace;\nit meant ruin, suicide. So he had determined, if he did not get hold of\nthe three thousand that would pay his debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so\nremove from his breast, from _that spot on his breast_, the shame he\ncarried upon it, that weighed on his conscience. All this will be fully\nexplained to the reader later on, but now that his last hope had\nvanished, this man, so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a\nlittle child a few steps from the Hohlakovs’ house. He walked on, and\nnot knowing what he was doing, wiped away his tears with his fist. In\nthis way he reached the square, and suddenly became aware that he had\nstumbled against something. He heard a piercing wail from an old woman\nwhom he had almost knocked down.\n\n“Good Lord, you’ve nearly killed me! Why don’t you look where you’re\ngoing, scapegrace?”\n\n“Why, it’s you!” cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark. It\nwas the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly\nnoticed the day before.\n\n“And who are you, my good sir?” said the old woman, in quite a\ndifferent voice. “I don’t know you in the dark.”\n\n“You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch’s. You’re the servant there?”",
            "11": "“Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch’s.... But I don’t\nknow you now.”\n\n“Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?” said\nMitya, beside himself with suspense. “I saw her to the house some time\nago.”\n\n“She has been there, sir. She stayed a little while, and went off\nagain.”\n\n“What? Went away?” cried Mitya. “When did she go?”\n\n“Why, as soon as she came. She only stayed a minute. She only told\nKuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh, and then she ran away.”\n\n“You’re lying, damn you!” roared Mitya.\n\n“Aie! Aie!” shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished.\n\nHe ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the\nmoment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not\nmore than a quarter of an hour after her departure.\n\nFenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the\nkitchen when “the captain” ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on\nseeing him.\n\n“You scream?” roared Mitya, “where is she?”\n\nBut without giving the terror‐stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he\nfell all of a heap at her feet.\n\n“Fenya, for Christ’s sake, tell me, where is she?”\n\n“I don’t know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don’t know. You may kill\nme but I can’t tell you.” Fenya swore and protested. “You went out with\nher yourself not long ago—”\n\n“She came back!”\n\n“Indeed she didn’t. By God I swear she didn’t come back.”\n\n“You’re lying!” shouted Mitya. “From your terror I know where she is.”\n\nHe rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily.\nBut she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or\nshe might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both\nFenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a\nbrass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more\nthan six inches long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand\nwhen, with the other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his\nside‐pocket.\n\n“Oh, Lord! He’s going to murder some one!” cried Fenya, flinging up her\nhands."

            "0": "Where was he running? “Where could she be except at Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s? She must have run straight to him from Samsonov’s, that\nwas clear now. The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.” ...\nIt all rushed whirling through his mind. He did not run to Marya\nKondratyevna’s. “There was no need to go there ... not the slightest\nneed ... he must raise no alarm ... they would run and tell\ndirectly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov\ntoo, he too, all had been bought over!”\n\nHe formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street,\nthen over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley\nat the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the\nhurdle fence of a neighbor’s kitchen‐garden, on the other the strong\nhigh fence, that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden. Here he\nchose a spot, apparently the very place, where according to the\ntradition, he knew Lizaveta had once climbed over it: “If she could\nclimb over it,” the thought, God knows why, occurred to him, “surely I\ncan.” He did in fact jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of\nthe top of the fence. Then he vigorously pulled himself up and sat\nastride on it. Close by, in the garden stood the bath‐house, but from\nthe fence he could see the lighted windows of the house too.\n\n“Yes, the old man’s bedroom is lighted up. She’s there!” and he leapt\nfrom the fence into the garden. Though he knew Grigory was ill and very\nlikely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him, he\ninstinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to listen. But there\nwas dead silence on all sides and, as though of design, complete\nstillness, not the slightest breath of wind.",
            "1": "“And naught but the whispering silence,” the line for some reason rose\nto his mind. “If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think\nnot.” Standing still for a minute, he walked softly over the grass in\nthe garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs. He walked slowly, creeping\nstealthily at every step, listening to his own footsteps. It took him\nfive minutes to reach the lighted window. He remembered that just under\nthe window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and\nwhitebeam. The door from the house into the garden on the left‐hand\nside, was shut; he had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing.\nAt last he reached the bushes and hid behind them. He held his breath.\n“I must wait now,” he thought, “to reassure them, in case they heard my\nfootsteps and are listening ... if only I don’t cough or sneeze.”\n\nHe waited two minutes. His heart was beating violently, and, at\nmoments, he could scarcely breathe. “No, this throbbing at my heart\nwon’t stop,” he thought. “I can’t wait any longer.” He was standing\nbehind a bush in the shadow. The light of the window fell on the front\npart of the bush.\n\n“How red the whitebeam berries are!” he murmured, not knowing why.\nSoftly and noiselessly, step by step, he approached the window, and\nraised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch’s bedroom lay open\nbefore him. It was not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a\nred screen, “Chinese,” as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it. The word\n“Chinese” flashed into Mitya’s mind, “and behind the screen, is\nGrushenka,” thought Mitya. He began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was\nwearing his new striped‐silk dressing‐gown, which Mitya had never seen,\nand a silk cord with tassels round the waist. A clean, dandified shirt\nof fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the\ndressing‐gown. On his head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage\nwhich Alyosha had seen.\n\n“He has got himself up,” thought Mitya.\n\nHis father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought.\nSuddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing\nwent up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter\nand drank it off. Then he uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a\nmoment, walked carelessly up to the looking‐glass on the wall, with his\nright hand raised the red bandage on his forehead a little, and began\nexamining his bruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.\n\n“He’s alone,” thought Mitya, “in all probability he’s alone.”",
            "2": "Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking‐glass, turned suddenly to\nthe window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the\nshadow.\n\n“She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she’s asleep by now,” he\nthought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from\nthe window. “He’s looking for her out of the window, so she’s not\nthere. Why should he stare out into the dark? He’s wild with\nimpatience.” ... Mitya slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at\nthe window again. The old man was sitting down at the table, apparently\ndisappointed. At last he put his elbow on the table, and laid his right\ncheek against his hand. Mitya watched him eagerly.\n\n“He’s alone, he’s alone!” he repeated again. “If she were here, his\nface would be different.”\n\nStrange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that\nshe was not here. “It’s not that she’s not here,” he explained to\nhimself, immediately, “but that I can’t tell for certain whether she is\nor not.” Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment\nexceptionally clear, that he took in everything to the slightest\ndetail, and missed no point. But a feeling of misery, the misery of\nuncertainty and indecision, was growing in his heart with every\ninstant. “Is she here or not?” The angry doubt filled his heart, and\nsuddenly, making up his mind, he put out his hand and softly knocked on\nthe window frame. He knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon\nwith Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times more quickly, the\nsignal that meant “Grushenka is here!”\n\nThe old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran\nto the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch\nopened the window and thrust his whole head out.\n\n“Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?” he said, in a sort of trembling\nhalf‐ whisper. “Where are you, my angel, where are you?” He was\nfearfully agitated and breathless.\n\n“He’s alone.” Mitya decided.\n\n“Where are you?” cried the old man again; and he thrust his head out\nfarther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions,\nright and left. “Come here, I’ve a little present for you. Come, I’ll\nshow you....”\n\n“He means the three thousand,” thought Mitya.\n\n“But where are you? Are you at the door? I’ll open it directly.”",
            "3": "And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the\nright, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the\ndarkness. In another second he would certainly have run out to open the\ndoor without waiting for Grushenka’s answer.\n\nMitya looked at him from the side without stirring. The old man’s\nprofile that he loathed so, his pendent Adam’s apple, his hooked nose,\nhis lips that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted\nup by the slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room. A\nhorrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in Mitya’s heart: “There he\nwas, his rival, the man who had tormented him, had ruined his life!” It\nwas a rush of that sudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he had\nspoken, as though foreseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the\narbor, when, in answer to Alyosha’s question, “How can you say you’ll\nkill our father?” “I don’t know, I don’t know,” he had said then.\n“Perhaps I shall not kill him, perhaps I shall. I’m afraid he’ll\nsuddenly be so loathsome to me at that moment. I hate his double chin,\nhis nose, his eyes, his shameless grin. I feel a personal repulsion.\nThat’s what I’m afraid of, that’s what may be too much for me.” ...\nThis personal repulsion was growing unendurable. Mitya was beside\nhimself, he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his pocket.\n\n\n“God was watching over me then,” Mitya himself said afterwards. At that\nvery moment Grigory waked up on his bed of sickness. Earlier in the\nevening he had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described\nto Ivan. He had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret,\nvery strong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his\nwife repeated a “certain prayer” over him, after which he had gone to\nbed. Marfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to\nstrong drink, slept like the dead beside her husband.",
            "4": "But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a\nmoment’s reflection, though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his\nback, he sat up in bed. Then he deliberated again, got up and dressed\nhurriedly. Perhaps his conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping\nwhile the house was unguarded “in such perilous times.” Smerdyakov,\nexhausted by his fit, lay motionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna\ndid not stir. “The stuff’s been too much for the woman,” Grigory\nthought, glancing at her, and groaning, he went out on the steps. No\ndoubt he only intended to look out from the steps, for he was hardly\nable to walk, the pain in his back and his right leg was intolerable.\nBut he suddenly remembered that he had not locked the little gate into\nthe garden that evening. He was the most punctual and precise of men, a\nman who adhered to an unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for\nyears. Limping and writhing with pain he went down the steps and\ntowards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he\nstepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something, perhaps caught\nsome sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master’s window open.\nNo one was looking out of it then.\n\n“What’s it open for? It’s not summer now,” thought Grigory, and\nsuddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something\nextraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a\nman seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very\nfast.\n\n“Good Lord!” cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in\nhis back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short\ncut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went\ntowards the bath‐house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence.\nGrigory followed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting\neverything. He reached the fence at the very moment the man was\nclimbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside himself, pounced on him,\nand clutched his leg in his two hands.\n\nYes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he,\nthe “monster,” the “parricide.”\n\n“Parricide!” the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could\nhear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though\nstruck by lightning.",
            "5": "Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In\nMitya’s hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the\ngrass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on\nthe path, in a most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the\nprostrate figure before him. The old man’s head was covered with blood.\nMitya put out his hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards\nclearly, that he had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had\nbroken the old man’s skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But\nthe blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya’s fingers were\ndrenched with the hot stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket\nthe clean white handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his\nvisit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man’s head,\nsenselessly trying to wipe the blood from his face and temples. But the\nhandkerchief was instantly soaked with blood.\n\n“Good heavens! what am I doing it for?” thought Mitya, suddenly pulling\nhimself together. “If I have broken his skull, how can I find out now?\nAnd what difference does it make now?” he added, hopelessly. “If I’ve\nkilled him, I’ve killed him.... You’ve come to grief, old man, so there\nyou must lie!” he said aloud. And suddenly turning to the fence, he\nvaulted over it into the lane and fell to running—the handkerchief\nsoaked with blood he held, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran\nhe thrust it into the back pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the\nfew passers‐by who met him in the dark, in the streets, remembered\nafterwards that they had met a man running that night. He flew back\nagain to the widow Morozov’s house.\n\nImmediately after he had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the\nchief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him, for Christ’s sake,\n“not to let the captain in again to‐day or to‐morrow.” Nazar Ivanovitch\npromised, but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for\nhim, and meeting his nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come\nfrom the country, on the way up told him to take his place, but forgot\nto mention “the captain.” Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked. The\nlad instantly recognized him, for Mitya had more than once tipped him.\nOpening the gate at once, he let him in, and hastened to inform him\nwith a good‐humored smile that “Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home\nnow, you know.”\n\n“Where is she then, Prohor?” asked Mitya, stopping short.",
            "6": "“She set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to\nMokroe.”\n\n“What for?” cried Mitya.\n\n“That I can’t say. To see some officer. Some one invited her and horses\nwere sent to fetch her.”\n\nMitya left him, and ran like a madman to Fenya."

Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her by the\nthroat.\n\n“Speak at once! Where is she? With whom is she now, at Mokroe?” he\nroared furiously.\n\nBoth the women squealed.\n\n“Aie! I’ll tell you. Aie! Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I’ll tell you\neverything directly, I won’t hide anything,” gabbled Fenya, frightened\nto death; “she’s gone to Mokroe, to her officer.”\n\n“What officer?” roared Mitya.\n\n“To her officer, the same one she used to know, the one who threw her\nover five years ago,” cackled Fenya, as fast as she could speak.\n\nMitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat. He\nstood facing her, pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his eyes\nshowed that he realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed\nthe whole position. Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to\nobserve whether he understood or not. She remained sitting on the trunk\nas she had been when he ran into the room, trembling all over, holding\nher hands out before her as though trying to defend herself. She seemed\nto have grown rigid in that position. Her wide‐opened, scared eyes were\nfixed immovably upon him. And to make matters worse, both his hands\nwere smeared with blood. On the way, as he ran, he must have touched\nhis forehead with them, wiping off the perspiration, so that on his\nforehead and his right cheek were blood‐stained patches. Fenya was on\nthe verge of hysterics. The old cook had jumped up and was staring at\nhim like a mad woman, almost unconscious with terror.\n\nMitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next to\nFenya. He sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror‐stricken,\nbenumbed. Yet everything was clear as day: that officer, he knew about\nhim, he knew everything perfectly, he had known it from Grushenka\nherself, had known that a letter had come from him a month before. So\nthat for a month, for a whole month, this had been going on, a secret\nfrom him, till the very arrival of this new man, and he had never\nthought of him! But how could he, how could he not have thought of him?\nWhy was it he had forgotten this officer, like that, forgotten him as\nsoon as he heard of him? That was the question that faced him like some\nmonstrous thing. And he looked at this monstrous thing with horror,\ngrowing cold with horror.",
            "1": "But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child,\nhe began speaking to Fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he\nhad scared and hurt her just now. He fell to questioning Fenya with an\nextreme preciseness, astonishing in his position, and though the girl\nlooked wildly at his blood‐stained hands, she, too, with wonderful\nreadiness and rapidity, answered every question as though eager to put\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth before him. Little by little,\neven with a sort of enjoyment, she began explaining every detail, not\nwanting to torment him, but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost\nservice to him. She described the whole of that day, in great detail,\nthe visit of Rakitin and Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had stood on the\nwatch, how the mistress had set off, and how she had called out of the\nwindow to Alyosha to give him, Mitya, her greetings, and to tell him\n“to remember for ever how she had loved him for an hour.”\n\nHearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush of\ncolor on his pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him, not a\nbit afraid now to be inquisitive:\n\n“Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They’re all over blood!”\n\n“Yes,” answered Mitya mechanically. He looked carelessly at his hands\nand at once forgot them and Fenya’s question.\n\nHe sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he had run\nin. His first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed\ndetermination had taken possession of him. He suddenly stood up,\nsmiling dreamily.\n\n“What has happened to you, sir?” said Fenya, pointing to his hands\nagain. She spoke compassionately, as though she felt very near to him\nnow in his grief. Mitya looked at his hands again.\n\n“That’s blood, Fenya,” he said, looking at her with a strange\nexpression. “That’s human blood, and my God! why was it shed? But ...\nFenya ... there’s a fence here” (he looked at her as though setting her\na riddle), “a high fence, and terrible to look at. But at dawn\nto‐morrow, when the sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You\ndon’t understand what fence, Fenya, and, never mind.... You’ll hear\nto‐morrow and understand ... and now, good‐by. I won’t stand in her\nway. I’ll step aside, I know how to step aside. Live, my joy.... You\nloved me for an hour, remember Mityenka Karamazov so for ever.... She\nalways used to call me Mityenka, do you remember?”",
            "2": "And with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was\nalmost more frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when\nhe ran in and attacked her.\n\nJust ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the\nyoung official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was by now\nhalf‐past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening tea, and\nhad just put his coat on again to go to the “Metropolis” to play\nbilliards. Mitya caught him coming out.\n\nSeeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered\na cry of surprise.\n\n“Good heavens! What is the matter?”\n\n“I’ve come for my pistols,” said Mitya, “and brought you the money. And\nthanks very much. I’m in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste.”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly caught sight of\na bundle of bank‐notes in Mitya’s hand, and what was more, he had\nwalked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries\nmoney: he had them in his right hand, and held them outstretched as if\nto show them. Perhotin’s servant‐boy, who met Mitya in the passage,\nsaid afterwards that he walked into the passage in the same way, with\nthe money outstretched in his hand, so he must have been carrying them\nlike that even in the streets. They were all rainbow‐colored\nhundred‐rouble notes, and the fingers holding them were covered with\nblood.\n\nWhen Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he\nsaid that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have\nbeen two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, “fat” bundle.\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” so he testified afterwards, “seemed unlike\nhimself, too; not drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything,\nbut at the same time, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and\nsearching for something and unable to come to a decision. He was in\ngreat haste, answered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments\nseemed not at all dejected but quite cheerful.”\n\n“But what _is_ the matter with you? What’s wrong?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch,\nlooking wildly at his guest. “How is it that you’re all covered with\nblood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!”\n\nHe took him by the elbow and led him to the glass.\n\nSeeing his blood‐stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully.",
            "3": "“Damnation! That’s the last straw,” he muttered angrily, hurriedly\nchanging the notes from his right hand to the left, and impulsively\njerked the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the handkerchief turned\nout to be soaked with blood, too (it was the handkerchief he had used\nto wipe Grigory’s face). There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it\nhad not merely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and\ncould not be pulled apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor.\n\n“Oh, damn it!” he said. “Haven’t you a rag of some sort ... to wipe my\nface?”\n\n“So you’re only stained, not wounded? You’d better wash,” said Pyotr\nIlyitch. “Here’s a wash‐stand. I’ll pour you out some water.”\n\n“A wash‐stand? That’s all right ... but where am I to put this?”\n\nWith the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred‐rouble\nnotes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him\nto decide what he, Mitya, was to do with his own money.\n\n“In your pocket, or on the table here. They won’t be lost.”\n\n“In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that’s all\nnonsense,” he cried, as though suddenly coming out of his absorption.\n“Look here, let’s first settle that business of the pistols. Give them\nback to me. Here’s your money ... because I am in great need of them\n... and I haven’t a minute, a minute to spare.”\n\nAnd taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to Pyotr\nIlyitch.\n\n“But I shan’t have change enough. Haven’t you less?”\n\n“No,” said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not\ntrusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones.\n\n“No, they’re all alike,” he added, and again he looked inquiringly at\nPyotr Ilyitch.\n\n“How have you grown so rich?” the latter asked. “Wait, I’ll send my boy\nto Plotnikov’s, they close late—to see if they won’t change it. Here,\nMisha!” he called into the passage.",
            "4": "“To Plotnikov’s shop—first‐rate!” cried Mitya, as though struck by an\nidea. “Misha,” he turned to the boy as he came in, “look here, run to\nPlotnikov’s and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his greetings,\nand will be there directly.... But listen, listen, tell them to have\nchampagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it\nwas to take to Mokroe. I took four dozen with me then,” he added\n(suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch); “they know all about it, don’t you\ntrouble, Misha,” he turned again to the boy. “Stay, listen; tell them\nto put in cheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and\neverything, everything they’ve got, up to a hundred roubles, or a\nhundred and twenty as before.... But wait: don’t let them forget\ndessert, sweets, pears, water‐melons, two or three or four—no, one\nmelon’s enough, and chocolate, candy, toffee, fondants; in fact,\neverything I took to Mokroe before, three hundred roubles’ worth with\nthe champagne ... let it be just the same again. And remember, Misha,\nif you are called Misha—His name is Misha, isn’t it?” He turned to\nPyotr Ilyitch again.\n\n“Wait a minute,” Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching him\nuneasily, “you’d better go yourself and tell them. He’ll muddle it.”\n\n“He will, I see he will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for\nthe commission.... If you don’t make a mistake, there’s ten roubles for\nyou, run along, make haste.... Champagne’s the chief thing, let them\nbring up champagne. And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I\nhad then.... They know what I had then.”\n\n“But listen!” Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. “I say,\nlet him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and\nyou go and tell them.... Give him your note. Be off, Misha! Put your\nbest leg forward!”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boy\nremained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open, apparently\nunderstanding little of Mitya’s orders, gazing up with amazement and\nterror at his blood‐stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers\nthat held the notes.\n\n“Well, now come and wash,” said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. “Put the money\non the table or else in your pocket.... That’s right, come along. But\ntake off your coat.”\n\nAnd beginning to help him off with his coat, he cried out again:\n\n“Look, your coat’s covered with blood, too!”",
            "5": "“That ... it’s not the coat. It’s only a little here on the sleeve....\nAnd that’s only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have soaked\nthrough. I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya’s, and the\nblood’s come through,” Mitya explained at once with a childlike\nunconsciousness that was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning.\n\n“Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been fighting\nwith some one,” he muttered.\n\nThey began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the\nwater. Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his hands (they were\ntrembling, and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards). But the young\nofficial insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more.\nHe seemed to exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on.\nIt may be noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character.\n\n“Look, you haven’t got your nails clean. Now rub your face; here, on\nyour temples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you\ngoing? Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.”\n\n“Yes, it’s all bloody,” observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his\nshirt.\n\n“Then change your shirt.”\n\n“I haven’t time. You see I’ll ...” Mitya went on with the same\nconfiding ingenuousness, drying his face and hands on the towel, and\nputting on his coat. “I’ll turn it up at the wrist. It won’t be seen\nunder the coat.... You see!”\n\n“Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting\nwith some one? In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating\nthat captain again?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked him reproachfully. “Whom have\nyou been beating now ... or killing, perhaps?”\n\n“Nonsense!” said Mitya.\n\n“Why ‘nonsense’?”\n\n“Don’t worry,” said Mitya, and he suddenly laughed. “I smashed an old\nwoman in the market‐place just now.”\n\n“Smashed? An old woman?”\n\n“An old man!” cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face,\nlaughing, and shouting at him as though he were deaf.\n\n“Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?”\n\n“We made it up. We had a row—and made it up. In a place I know of. We\nparted friends. A fool.... He’s forgiven me.... He’s sure to have\nforgiven me by now ... if he had got up, he wouldn’t have forgiven\nme”—Mitya suddenly winked—“only damn him, you know, I say, Pyotr\nIlyitch, damn him! Don’t worry about him! I don’t want to just now!”\nMitya snapped out, resolutely.",
            "6": "“Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ...\nJust as you did with that captain over some nonsense.... You’ve been\nfighting and now you’re rushing off on the spree—that’s you all over!\nThree dozen champagne—what do you want all that for?”\n\n“Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I’ve no time now. I\nshould like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven’t the\ntime. And there’s no need, it’s too late for talking. Where’s my money?\nWhere have I put it?” he cried, thrusting his hands into his pockets.\n\n“You put it on the table ... yourself.... Here it is. Had you\nforgotten? Money’s like dirt or water to you, it seems. Here are your\npistols. It’s an odd thing, at six o’clock you pledged them for ten\nroubles, and now you’ve got thousands. Two or three I should say.”\n\n“Three, you bet,” laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the\nside‐pocket of his trousers.\n\n“You’ll lose it like that. Have you found a gold‐mine?”\n\n“The mines? The gold‐mines?” Mitya shouted at the top of his voice and\nwent off into a roar of laughter. “Would you like to go to the mines,\nPerhotin? There’s a lady here who’ll stump up three thousand for you,\nif only you’ll go. She did it for me, she’s so awfully fond of\ngold‐mines. Do you know Madame Hohlakov?”\n\n“I don’t know her, but I’ve heard of her and seen her. Did she really\ngive you three thousand? Did she really?” said Pyotr Ilyitch, eyeing\nhim dubiously.\n\n“As soon as the sun rises to‐morrow, as soon as Phœbus, ever young,\nflies upwards, praising and glorifying God, you go to her, this Madame\nHohlakov, and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or\nnot. Try and find out.”\n\n“I don’t know on what terms you are ... since you say it so positively,\nI suppose she did give it to you. You’ve got the money in your hand,\nbut instead of going to Siberia you’re spending it all.... Where are\nyou really off to now, eh?”\n\n“To Mokroe.”\n\n“To Mokroe? But it’s night!”\n\n“Once the lad had all, now the lad has naught,” cried Mitya suddenly.\n\n“How ‘naught’? You say that with all those thousands!”\n\n“I’m not talking about thousands. Damn thousands! I’m talking of the\nfemale character.\n\nFickle is the heart of woman\nTreacherous and full of vice;\n\n\nI agree with Ulysses. That’s what he says.”\n\n“I don’t understand you!”\n\n“Am I drunk?”\n\n“Not drunk, but worse.”\n\n“I’m drunk in spirit, Pyotr Ilyitch, drunk in spirit! But that’s\nenough!”\n\n“What are you doing, loading the pistol?”\n\n“I’m loading the pistol.”",
            "7": "Unfastening the pistol‐case, Mitya actually opened the powder horn, and\ncarefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge. Then he took the bullet\nand, before inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the\ncandle.\n\n“Why are you looking at the bullet?” asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching him\nwith uneasy curiosity.\n\n“Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, would\nyou look at it or not?”\n\n“Why look at it?”\n\n“It’s going into my brain, so it’s interesting to look and see what\nit’s like. But that’s foolishness, a moment’s foolishness. Now that’s\ndone,” he added, putting in the bullet and driving it home with the\nramrod. “Pyotr Ilyitch, my dear fellow, that’s nonsense, all nonsense,\nand if only you knew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper\nnow.”\n\n“Here’s some paper.”\n\n“No, a clean new piece, writing‐paper. That’s right.”\n\nAnd taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded\nthe paper in four, and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket. He put the\npistols in the case, locked it up, and kept it in his hand. Then he\nlooked at Pyotr Ilyitch with a slow, thoughtful smile.\n\n“Now, let’s go.”\n\n“Where are we going? No, wait a minute.... Are you thinking of putting\nthat bullet in your brain, perhaps?” Pyotr Ilyitch asked uneasily.\n\n“I was fooling about the bullet! I want to live. I love life! You may\nbe sure of that. I love golden‐haired Phœbus and his warm light....\nDear Pyotr Ilyitch, do you know how to step aside?”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘stepping aside’?”\n\n“Making way. Making way for a dear creature, and for one I hate. And to\nlet the one I hate become dear—that’s what making way means! And to say\nto them: God bless you, go your way, pass on, while I—”\n\n“While you—?”\n\n“That’s enough, let’s go.”\n\n“Upon my word. I’ll tell some one to prevent your going there,” said\nPyotr Ilyitch, looking at him. “What are you going to Mokroe for, now?”\n\n“There’s a woman there, a woman. That’s enough for you. You shut up.”\n\n“Listen, though you’re such a savage I’ve always liked you.... I feel\nanxious.”\n\n“Thanks, old fellow. I’m a savage you say. Savages, savages! That’s\nwhat I am always saying. Savages! Why, here’s Misha! I was forgetting\nhim.”\n\nMisha ran in, post‐haste, with a handful of notes in change, and\nreported that every one was in a bustle at the Plotnikovs’; “They’re\ncarrying down the bottles, and the fish, and the tea; it will all be\nready directly.” Mitya seized ten roubles and handed it to Pyotr\nIlyitch, then tossed another ten‐rouble note to Misha.",
            "8": "“Don’t dare to do such a thing!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch. “I won’t have it\nin my house, it’s a bad, demoralizing habit. Put your money away. Here,\nput it here, why waste it? It would come in handy to‐morrow, and I dare\nsay you’ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again. Why do you keep\nputting the notes in your side‐pocket? Ah, you’ll lose them!”\n\n“I say, my dear fellow, let’s go to Mokroe together.”\n\n“What should I go for?”\n\n“I say, let’s open a bottle at once, and drink to life! I want to\ndrink, and especially to drink with you. I’ve never drunk with you,\nhave I?”\n\n“Very well, we can go to the ‘Metropolis.’ I was just going there.”\n\n“I haven’t time for that. Let’s drink at the Plotnikovs’, in the back\nroom. Shall I ask you a riddle?”\n\n“Ask away.”\n\nMitya took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket, unfolded it\nand showed it. In a large, distinct hand was written: “I punish myself\nfor my whole life, my whole life I punish!”\n\n“I will certainly speak to some one, I’ll go at once,” said Pyotr\nIlyitch, after reading the paper.\n\n“You won’t have time, dear boy, come and have a drink. March!”\n\nPlotnikov’s shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one to\nPyotr Ilyitch’s. It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by no\nmeans a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants. They kept everything\nthat could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, wines\n“bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,” fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar,\nand so on. There were three shop‐assistants and two errand boys always\nemployed. Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the\nlandowners had gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery\nstores flourished as before, every year with increasing prosperity;\nthere were plenty of purchasers for their goods.",
            "9": "They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. They had vivid\nrecollections of how he had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine and\ngoods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for in\ncash (they would never have let him have anything on credit, of\ncourse). They remembered that then, as now, he had had a bundle of\nhundred‐rouble notes in his hand, and had scattered them at random,\nwithout bargaining, without reflecting, or caring to reflect what use\nso much wine and provisions would be to him. The story was told all\nover the town that, driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he had\n“spent three thousand in one night and the following day, and had come\nback from the spree without a penny.” He had picked up a whole troop of\ngypsies (encamped in our neighborhood at the time), who for two days\ngot money without stint out of him while he was drunk, and drank\nexpensive wine without stint. People used to tell, laughing at Mitya,\nhow he had given champagne to grimy‐ handed peasants, and feasted the\nvillage women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies. Though to laugh\nat Mitya to his face was rather a risky proceeding, there was much\nlaughter behind his back, especially in the tavern, at his own\ningenuous public avowal that all he had got out of Grushenka by this\n“escapade” was “permission to kiss her foot, and that was the utmost\nshe had allowed him.”\n\nBy the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cart\nwith three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, the\ndriver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance. In the shop they had\nalmost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were only\nwaiting for Mitya’s arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart.\nPyotr Ilyitch was astounded.\n\n“Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?” he asked Mitya.\n\n“I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him to drive straight here to\nthe shop. There’s no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but\nTimofey now has gone on before me with the witch. Shall we be very\nlate, Andrey?”\n\n“They’ll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe.\nI got Timofey ready to start. I know how he’ll go. Their pace won’t be\nours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be? They won’t get there an\nhour earlier!” Andrey, a lanky, red‐haired, middle‐aged driver, wearing\na full‐ skirted coat, and with a kaftan on his arm, replied warmly.\n\n“Fifty roubles for vodka if we’re only an hour behind them.”",
            "10": "“I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won’t be half an\nhour before us, let alone an hour.”\n\nThough Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he gave his orders\nstrangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He began a\nsentence and forgot the end of it. Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged\nto come to the rescue.\n\n“Four hundred roubles’ worth, not less than four hundred roubles’\nworth, just as it was then,” commanded Mitya. “Four dozen champagne,\nnot a bottle less.”\n\n“What do you want with so much? What’s it for? Stay!” cried Pyotr\nIlyitch. “What’s this box? What’s in it? Surely there isn’t four\nhundred roubles’ worth here?”\n\nThe officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the\nfirst box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only\n“the most indispensable articles,” such as savories, sweets, toffee,\netc. But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent\noff, as on the previous occasion, in a special cart also with three\nhorses traveling at full speed, so that it would arrive not more than\nan hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.\n\n“Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee\nand fondants. The girls there are so fond of it,” Mitya insisted hotly.\n\n“The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen of\nchampagne? One would be enough,” said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry. He\nbegan bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to be\nsatisfied. But he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles. In the\nend it was agreed that only three hundred roubles’ worth should be\nsent.\n\n“Well, you may go to the devil!” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second\nthoughts. “What’s it to do with me? Throw away your money, since it’s\ncost you nothing.”\n\n“This way, my economist, this way, don’t be angry.” Mitya drew him into\na room at the back of the shop. “They’ll give us a bottle here\ndirectly. We’ll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for\nyou’re a nice fellow, the sort I like.”\n\nMitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with a\ndirty dinner‐napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagne\nsoon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen.\n“First‐class oysters, the last lot in.”\n\n“Hang the oysters. I don’t eat them. And we don’t need anything,” cried\nPyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.",
            "11": "“There’s no time for oysters,” said Mitya. “And I’m not hungry. Do you\nknow, friend,” he said suddenly, with feeling, “I never have liked all\nthis disorder.”\n\n“Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word,\nthat’s enough to make any one angry!”\n\n“That’s not what I mean. I’m talking of a higher order. There’s no\norder in me, no higher order. But ... that’s all over. There’s no need\nto grieve about it. It’s too late, damn it! My whole life has been\ndisorder, and one must set it in order. Is that a pun, eh?”\n\n“You’re raving, not making puns!”\n\n“Glory be to God in Heaven,\nGlory be to God in me....\n\n\n“That verse came from my heart once, it’s not a verse, but a tear.... I\nmade it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain’s beard,\nthough....”\n\n“Why do you bring him in all of a sudden?”\n\n“Why do I bring him in? Foolery! All things come to an end; all things\nare made equal. That’s the long and short of it.”\n\n“You know, I keep thinking of your pistols.”\n\n“That’s all foolery, too! Drink, and don’t be fanciful. I love life.\nI’ve loved life too much, shamefully much. Enough! Let’s drink to life,\ndear boy, I propose the toast. Why am I pleased with myself? I’m a\nscoundrel, but I’m satisfied with myself. And yet I’m tortured by the\nthought that I’m a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself. I bless the\ncreation. I’m ready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I\nmust kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life\nfor others.... Let us drink to life, dear brother. What can be more\nprecious than life? Nothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!”\n\n“Let’s drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like.”\n\nThey drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet\nhe was melancholy, too. It was as though some heavy, overwhelming\nanxiety were weighing upon him.\n\n“Misha ... here’s your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink this\nglass to Phœbus, the golden‐haired, of to‐morrow morn....”\n\n“What are you giving it him for?” cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably.\n\n“Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!”\n\n“E—ech!”\n\nMisha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out.\n\n“He’ll remember it afterwards,” Mitya remarked. “Woman, I love woman!\nWhat is woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad,\nPyotr Ilyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? ‘I am very sorry, good Horatio!\nAlas, poor Yorick!’ Perhaps that’s me, Yorick? Yes, I’m Yorick now, and\na skull afterwards.”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while.",
            "12": "“What dog’s that you’ve got here?” he asked the shopman, casually,\nnoticing a pretty little lap‐dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.\n\n“It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,” answered the clerk.\n“She brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her.”\n\n“I saw one like it ... in the regiment ...” murmured Mitya dreamily,\n“only that one had its hind leg broken.... By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I\nwanted to ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?”\n\n“What a question!”\n\n“Oh, I didn’t mean anything. From somebody’s pocket, you know. I don’t\nmean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do,\ntoo....”\n\n“You go to the devil.”\n\n“I’m talking of other people’s money. Stealing straight out of a\npocket? Out of a purse, eh?”\n\n“I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I\ntook it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.”\n\n“Well, and what happened?”\n\n“Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, and\ngave it back.”\n\n“And what then?”\n\n“Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen\nsomething?”\n\n“I have,” said Mitya, winking slyly.\n\n“What have you stolen?” inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously.\n\n“I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and\ngave it back three days after.”\n\nAs he said this, Mitya suddenly got up.\n\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won’t you come now?” called Andrey from the door\nof the shop.\n\n“Are you ready? We’ll come!” Mitya started. “A few more last words\nand—Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting. Give him some brandy as well!\nThat box” (the one with the pistols) “put under my seat. Good‐by, Pyotr\nIlyitch, don’t remember evil against me.”\n\n“But you’re coming back to‐morrow?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“Will you settle the little bill now?” cried the clerk, springing\nforward.\n\n“Oh, yes, the bill. Of course.”\n\nHe pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again, picked out three\nhundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of\nthe shop. Every one followed him out, bowing and wishing him good luck.\nAndrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on\nthe box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his\nsurprise he saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands\nbefore him with a cry, and plumped down at his feet.",
            "13": "“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don’t harm my\nmistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don’t murder him,\nhe came first, he’s hers! He’ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That’s\nwhy he’s come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don’t take\na fellow creature’s life!”\n\n“Tut—tut—tut! That’s it, is it? So you’re off there to make trouble!”\nmuttered Pyotr Ilyitch. “Now, it’s all clear, as clear as daylight.\nDmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave\nlike a man,” he shouted aloud to Mitya. “Do you hear, Dmitri?”\n\n“The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I’ll throw them into the pool on the\nroad,” answered Mitya. “Fenya, get up, don’t kneel to me. Mitya won’t\nhurt any one, the silly fool won’t hurt any one again. But I say,\nFenya,” he shouted, after having taken his seat. “I hurt you just now,\nso forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it\ndoesn’t matter if you don’t. It’s all the same now. Now then, Andrey,\nlook alive, fly along full speed!”\n\nAndrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing.\n\n“Good‐by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...”\n\n“He’s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,” Pyotr Ilyitch\nthought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the\ncart packed with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they\nwould deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with\nhimself, he turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play\nbilliards.\n\n“He’s a fool, though he’s a good fellow,” he muttered as he went. “I’ve\nheard of that officer, Grushenka’s former flame. Well, if he has turned\nup.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I’m not his nurse! Let them do\nwhat they like! Besides, it’ll all come to nothing. They’re a set of\nbrawlers, that’s all. They’ll drink and fight, fight and make friends\nagain. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by ‘I’m\nstepping aside, I’m punishing myself?’ It’ll come to nothing! He’s\nshouted such phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now\nhe’s not drunk. ‘Drunk in spirit’—they’re fond of fine phrases, the\nvillains. Am I his nurse? He must have been fighting, his face was all\nover blood. With whom? I shall find out at the ‘Metropolis.’ And his\nhandkerchief was soaked in blood.... It’s still lying on my floor....\nHang it!”",
            "14": "He reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game. The\ngame cheered him. He played a second game, and suddenly began telling\none of his partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash\nagain—something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe\nagain to spend it with Grushenka.... This news roused singular interest\nin his listeners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a\nstrange gravity. They left off playing.\n\n“Three thousand? But where can he have got three thousand?”\n\nQuestions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov’s present was\nreceived with skepticism.\n\n“Hasn’t he robbed his old father?—that’s the question.”\n\n“Three thousand! There’s something odd about it.”\n\n“He boasted aloud that he would kill his father; we all heard him,\nhere. And it was three thousand he talked about ...”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he became short and dry in his\nanswers. He said not a word about the blood on Mitya’s face and hands,\nthough he had meant to speak of it at first.\n\nThey began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away.\nBut by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for\nbilliards; he laid down the cue, and without having supper as he had\nintended, he walked out of the tavern. When he reached the market‐place\nhe stood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that\nwhat he wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s and find out if\nanything had happened there. “On account of some stupid nonsense—as\nit’s sure to turn out—am I going to wake up the household and make a\nscandal? Fooh! damn it, is it my business to look after them?”\n\nIn a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered\nFenya. “Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,” he\nthought with vexation, “I should have heard everything.” And the desire\nto speak to her, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate\nthat when he was half‐way home he turned abruptly and went towards the\nhouse where Grushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The\nsound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him and made him\nfeel annoyed. And no one answered him; every one in the house was\nasleep.\n\n“And I shall be making a fuss!” he thought, with a feeling of positive\ndiscomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking\nagain with all his might, filling the street with clamor.",
            "15": "“Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!” he muttered at each\nknock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks\non the gate."

            "0": "But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little\nmore than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey’s three horses galloped\nat such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a\nquarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool,\nthere were big stars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and\nperhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and\nrapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.\n\nAll was confusion, confusion, in Mitya’s soul, but although many things\nwere goading his heart, at that moment his whole being was yearning for\nher, his queen, to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time.\nOne thing I can say for certain; his heart did not waver for one\ninstant. I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous\nlover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to\nhave sprung out of the earth. If any other had appeared on the scene,\nhe would have been jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his\nfierce hands with blood again. But as he flew through the night, he\nfelt no envy, no hostility even, for the man who had been her first\nlover.... It is true he had not yet seen him.\n\n“Here there was no room for dispute: it was her right and his; this was\nher first love which, after five years, she had not forgotten; so she\nhad loved him only for those five years, and I, how do I come in? What\nright have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now\neverything is over apart from the officer—even if he had not appeared,\neverything would be over ...”\n\nThese words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been\ncapable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His\npresent plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya’s first\nwords, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with\nall its consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was\nconfusion in his soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not\ngive him peace. There was so much behind that tortured him. And it\nseemed strange to him, at moments, to think that he had written his own\nsentence of death with pen and paper: “I punish myself,” and the paper\nwas lying there in his pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had\nalready resolved how, next morning, he would meet the first warm ray of\n“golden‐haired Phœbus.”",
            "1": "And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left\nbehind and that tortured him. He felt that miserably, and the thought\nof it sank into his heart with despair. There was one moment when he\nfelt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out\nhis loaded pistol, and to make an end of everything without waiting for\nthe dawn. But that moment flew by like a spark. The horses galloped on,\n“devouring space,” and as he drew near his goal, again the thought of\nher, of her alone, took more and more complete possession of his soul,\nchasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it. Oh, how he\nlonged to look upon her, if only for a moment, if only from a distance!\n\n“She’s now with _him_,” he thought, “now I shall see what she looks\nlike with him, her first love, and that’s all I want.” Never had this\nwoman, who was such a fateful influence in his life, aroused such love\nin his breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to\nhimself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to self‐effacement before her!\n“I will efface myself!” he said, in a rush of almost hysterical\necstasy.\n\nThey had been galloping nearly an hour. Mitya was silent, and though\nAndrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he did not utter a word,\neither. He seemed afraid to talk, he only whipped up smartly his three\nlean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible\nanxiety:\n\n“Andrey! What if they’re asleep?”\n\nThis thought fell upon him like a blow. It had not occurred to him\nbefore.\n\n“It may well be that they’re gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”\n\nMitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he was rushing there\n... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ... she was asleep,\nperhaps, there too.... An angry feeling surged up in his heart.\n\n“Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up! Look alive!” he cried, beside himself.\n\n“But maybe they’re not in bed!” Andrey went on after a pause. “Timofey\nsaid they were a lot of them there—”\n\n“At the station?”\n\n“Not at the posting‐station, but at Plastunov’s, at the inn, where they\nlet out horses, too.”\n\n“I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How’s that? Who are they?”\ncried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.\n\n“Well, Timofey was saying they’re all gentlefolk. Two from our town—who\nthey are I can’t say—and there are two others, strangers, maybe more\nbesides. I didn’t ask particularly. They’ve set to playing cards, so\nTimofey said.”\n\n“Cards?”",
            "2": "“So, maybe they’re not in bed if they’re at cards. It’s most likely not\nmore than eleven.”\n\n“Quicker, Andrey! Quicker!” Mitya cried again, nervously.\n\n“May I ask you something, sir?” said Andrey, after a pause. “Only I’m\nafraid of angering you, sir.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to\nharm her mistress, and some one else, too ... so you see, sir— It’s I\nam taking you there ... forgive me, sir, it’s my conscience ... maybe\nit’s stupid of me to speak of it—”\n\nMitya suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind.\n\n“Are you a driver?” he asked frantically.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then you know that one has to make way. What would you say to a driver\nwho wouldn’t make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush\npeople? No, a driver mustn’t run over people. One can’t run over a man.\nOne can’t spoil people’s lives. And if you have spoilt a life—punish\nyourself.... If only you’ve spoilt, if only you’ve ruined any one’s\nlife—punish yourself and go away.”\n\nThese phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically. Though Andrey was\nsurprised at him, he kept up the conversation.\n\n“That’s right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you’re quite right, one mustn’t\ncrush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is\ncreated by God. Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among\nus drivers, drive anyhow. Nothing will restrain them, they just force\nit along.”\n\n“To hell?” Mitya interrupted, and went off into his abrupt, short\nlaugh. “Andrey, simple soul,” he seized him by the shoulders again,\n“tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what\ndo you think?”\n\n“I don’t know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... you see,\nsir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He went\nstraight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that\nwere in agony. And the devil groaned, because he thought that he would\nget no more sinners in hell. And God said to him, then, ‘Don’t groan,\nfor you shall have all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief\njudges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in\nall the ages till I come again.’ Those were His very words ...”\n\n“A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!”\n\n“So you see, sir, who it is hell’s for,” said Andrey, whipping up the\nleft horse, “but you’re like a little child ... that’s how we look on\nyou ... and though you’re hasty‐tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you\nfor your kind heart.”",
            "3": "“And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?”\n\n“What should I forgive you for, sir? You’ve never done me any harm.”\n\n“No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will\nyou forgive me for every one? Speak, simple peasant heart!”\n\n“Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange.”\n\nBut Mitya did not hear. He was frantically praying and muttering to\nhimself.\n\n“Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me. Let\nme pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned\nmyself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but\nI love Thee. If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and\nfrom there I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever.... But\nlet me love to the end.... Here and now for just five hours ... till\nthe first light of Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ... I\nlove her and I cannot help loving her. Thou seest my whole heart.... I\nshall gallop up, I shall fall before her and say, ‘You are right to\npass on and leave me. Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret\nyourself about me!’ ”\n\n“Mokroe!” cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his whip.\n\nThrough the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of\nbuildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain. The village of\nMokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were\nasleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.\n\n“Drive on, Andrey, I come!” Mitya exclaimed, feverishly.\n\n“They’re not asleep,” said Andrey again, pointing with his whip to the\nPlastunovs’ inn, which was at the entrance to the village. The six\nwindows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.\n\n“They’re not asleep,” Mitya repeated joyously. “Quicker, Andrey!\nGallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that\nI have come. I’m coming! I’m coming, too!”\n\nAndrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and\npulled up his steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.\n\nMitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his way to bed,\npeeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.\n\n“Trifon Borissovitch, is that you?”\n\nThe innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and\nrushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.\n\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again?”",
            "4": "Trifon Borissovitch was a thick‐set, healthy peasant, of middle height,\nwith a rather fat face. His expression was severe and uncompromising,\nespecially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he had the power of\nassuming the most obsequious countenance, when he had an inkling that\nit was to his interest. He dressed in Russian style, with a shirt\nbuttoning down on one side, and a full‐skirted coat. He had saved a\ngood sum of money, but was for ever dreaming of improving his position.\nMore than half the peasants were in his clutches, every one in the\nneighborhood was in debt to him. From the neighboring landowners he\nbought and rented lands which were worked by the peasants, in payment\nof debts which they could never shake off. He was a widower, with four\ngrown‐up daughters. One of them was already a widow and lived in the\ninn with her two children, his grandchildren, and worked for him like a\ncharwoman. Another of his daughters was married to a petty official,\nand in one of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among\nthe family photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in\nuniform and official epaulettes. The two younger daughters used to wear\nfashionable blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back, and with\ntrains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went to pay visits.\nBut next morning they would get up at dawn, as usual, sweep out the\nrooms with a birch‐broom, empty the slops, and clean up after lodgers.\n\nIn spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved, Trifon Borissovitch\nwas very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and\nremembering that not a month ago he had, in twenty‐four hours, made two\nif not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri, when he had come on his\nescapade with Grushenka, he met him now with eager welcome, scenting\nhis prey the moment Mitya drove up to the steps.\n\n“Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!”\n\n“Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,” began Mitya, “first and foremost, where is\nshe?”\n\n“Agrafena Alexandrovna?” The inn‐keeper understood at once, looking\nsharply into Mitya’s face. “She’s here, too ...”\n\n“With whom? With whom?”\n\n“Some strangers. One is an official gentleman, a Pole, to judge from\nhis speech. He sent the horses for her from here; and there’s another\nwith him, a friend of his, or a fellow traveler, there’s no telling.\nThey’re dressed like civilians.”\n\n“Well, are they feasting? Have they money?”\n\n“Poor sort of a feast! Nothing to boast of, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”",
            "5": "“Nothing to boast of? And who are the others?”\n\n“They’re two gentlemen from the town.... They’ve come back from\nTcherny, and are putting up here. One’s quite a young gentleman, a\nrelative of Mr. Miüsov, he must be, but I’ve forgotten his name ... and\nI expect you know the other, too, a gentleman called Maximov. He’s been\non a pilgrimage, so he says, to the monastery in the town. He’s\ntraveling with this young relation of Mr. Miüsov.”\n\n“Is that all?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Stay, listen, Trifon Borissovitch. Tell me the chief thing: What of\nher? How is she?”\n\n“Oh, she’s only just come. She’s sitting with them.”\n\n“Is she cheerful? Is she laughing?”\n\n“No, I think she’s not laughing much. She’s sitting quite dull. She’s\ncombing the young gentleman’s hair.”\n\n“The Pole—the officer?”\n\n“He’s not young, and he’s not an officer, either. Not him, sir. It’s\nthe young gentleman that’s Mr. Miüsov’s relation ... I’ve forgotten his\nname.”\n\n“Kalganov.”\n\n“That’s it, Kalganov!”\n\n“All right. I’ll see for myself. Are they playing cards?”\n\n“They have been playing, but they’ve left off. They’ve been drinking\ntea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.”\n\n“Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I’ll see for myself.\nNow answer one more question: are the gypsies here?”\n\n“You can’t have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities\nhave sent them away. But we’ve Jews that play the cymbals and the\nfiddle in the village, so one might send for them. They’d come.”\n\n“Send for them. Certainly send for them!” cried Mitya. “And you can get\nthe girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too,\nand Arina. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!”\n\n“Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by\nnow they’re asleep. Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such\ncoarseness and rudeness! What’s the good of giving a peasant a cigar to\nsmoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I’ll\nget my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that. They’ve\nonly just gone to bed, I’ll give them a kick and set them singing for\nyou. You gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e—ech!”\n\nFor all his pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had\nhidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had\npicked up a hundred‐rouble note under the table, and it had remained in\nhis clutches.",
            "6": "“Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I\nwas here. Do you remember?”\n\n“You did send it flying. I may well remember. You must have left three\nthousand behind you.”\n\n“Well, I’ve come to do the same again, do you see?”\n\nAnd he pulled out his roll of notes, and held them up before the\ninnkeeper’s nose.\n\n“Now, listen and remember. In an hour’s time the wine will arrive,\nsavories, pies, and sweets—bring them all up at once. That box Andrey\nhas got is to be brought up at once, too. Open it, and hand champagne\nimmediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially.”\n\nHe turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.\n\n“Here, Andrey, let’s settle. Here’s fifteen roubles for the drive, and\nfifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love.... Remember\nKaramazov!”\n\n“I’m afraid, sir,” faltered Andrey. “Give me five roubles extra, but\nmore I won’t take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness. Forgive my\nfoolish words ...”\n\n“What are you afraid of?” asked Mitya, scanning him. “Well, go to the\ndevil, if that’s it!” he cried, flinging him five roubles. “Now, Trifon\nBorissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them,\nso that they don’t see me. Where are they? In the blue room?”\n\nTrifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once\nobediently did his bidding. Leading him into the passage, he went\nhimself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors\nwere sitting, and took the light away. Then he stealthily led Mitya in,\nand put him in a corner in the dark, whence he could freely watch the\ncompany without being seen. But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed,\nhe could not see them, he saw her, his heart throbbed violently, and\nall was dark before his eyes.",
            "7": "She was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her,\non the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov. She was holding his hand\nand seemed to be laughing, while he, seeming vexed and not looking at\nher, was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other\nside of the table, facing Grushenka. Maximov was laughing violently at\nsomething. On the sofa sat _he_, and on a chair by the sofa there was\nanother stranger. The one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a\npipe, and Mitya had an impression of a stoutish, broad‐faced, short\nlittle man, who was apparently angry about something. His friend, the\nother stranger, struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he could make\nout nothing more. He caught his breath. He could not bear it for a\nminute, he put the pistol‐ case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart\nhe walked, feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face\nthe company.\n\n“Aie!” shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him."

            "0": "With his long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering\nat every word, “I ... I’m all right! Don’t be afraid!” he exclaimed,\n“I—there’s nothing the matter,” he turned suddenly to Grushenka, who\nhad shrunk back in her chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his hand\ntightly. “I ... I’m coming, too. I’m here till morning. Gentlemen, may\nI stay with you till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in\nthis same room?”\n\nSo he finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting\non the sofa. The latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and\nobserved severely:\n\n“_Panie_, we’re here in private. There are other rooms.”\n\n“Why, it’s you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?” answered\nKalganov suddenly. “Sit down with us. How are you?”\n\n“Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a\nlot of you.” Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out\nhis hand across the table.\n\n“Aie! How tight you squeeze! You’ve quite broken my fingers,” laughed\nKalganov.\n\n“He always squeezes like that, always,” Grushenka put in gayly, with a\ntimid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya’s face that he was\nnot going to make a scene. She was watching him with intense curiosity\nand still some uneasiness. She was impressed by something about him,\nand indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in\nand speak like this at such a moment.\n\n“Good evening,” Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up\nto him, too.\n\n“Good evening. You’re here, too! How glad I am to find you here, too!\nGentlemen, gentlemen, I—” (He addressed the Polish gentleman with the\npipe again, evidently taking him for the most important person\npresent.) “I flew here.... I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour\nin this room, in this very room ... where I, too, adored ... my\nqueen.... Forgive me, _panie_,” he cried wildly, “I flew here and\nvowed— Oh, don’t be afraid, it’s my last night! Let’s drink to our good\nunderstanding. They’ll bring the wine at once.... I brought this with\nme.” (Something made him pull out his bundle of notes.) “Allow me,\n_panie_! I want to have music, singing, a revel, as we had before. But\nthe worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl away, and there’ll be no\nmore of him. I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night.”",
            "1": "He was almost choking. There was so much, so much he wanted to say, but\nstrange exclamations were all that came from his lips. The Pole gazed\nfixedly at him, at the bundle of notes in his hand; looked at\nGrushenka, and was in evident perplexity.\n\n“If my suverin lady is permitting—” he was beginning.\n\n“What does ‘suverin’ mean? ‘Sovereign,’ I suppose?” interrupted\nGrushenka. “I can’t help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down,\nMitya, what are you talking about? Don’t frighten us, please. You won’t\nfrighten us, will you? If you won’t, I am glad to see you ...”\n\n“Me, me frighten you?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. “Oh, pass me\nby, go your way, I won’t hinder you!...”\n\nAnd suddenly he surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by\nflinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his head\naway to the opposite wall, while his arms clasped the back of the chair\ntight, as though embracing it.\n\n“Come, come, what a fellow you are!” cried Grushenka reproachfully.\n“That’s just how he comes to see me—he begins talking, and I can’t make\nout what he means. He cried like that once before, and now he’s crying\nagain! It’s shameful! Why are you crying? _As though you had anything\nto cry for!_” she added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some\nirritability.\n\n“I ... I’m not crying.... Well, good evening!” He instantly turned\nround in his chair, and suddenly laughed, not his abrupt wooden laugh,\nbut a long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.\n\n“Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!” Grushenka\nsaid to him persuasively. “I’m very glad you’ve come, very glad, Mitya,\ndo you hear, I’m very glad! I want him to stay here with us,” she said\nperemptorily, addressing the whole company, though her words were\nobviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa. “I wish it, I wish it!\nAnd if he goes away I shall go, too!” she added with flashing eyes.\n\n“What my queen commands is law!” pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing\nGrushenka’s hand. “I beg you, _panie_, to join our company,” he added\npolitely, addressing Mitya.\n\nMitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another\ntirade, but the words did not come.\n\n“Let’s drink, _panie_,” he blurted out instead of making a speech.\nEvery one laughed.",
            "2": "“Good heavens! I thought he was going to begin again!” Grushenka\nexclaimed nervously. “Do you hear, Mitya,” she went on insistently,\n“don’t prance about, but it’s nice you’ve brought the champagne. I want\nsome myself, and I can’t bear liqueurs. And best of all, you’ve come\nyourself. We were fearfully dull here.... You’ve come for a spree\nagain, I suppose? But put your money in your pocket. Where did you get\nsuch a lot?”\n\nMitya had been, all this time, holding in his hand the crumpled bundle\nof notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed.\nIn confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket. He flushed. At\nthat moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne,\nand glasses on a tray. Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he was so\nbewildered that he did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it\nfrom him and poured out the champagne.\n\n“Another! Another bottle!” Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and,\nforgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he had so solemnly\ninvited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his glass\nwithout waiting for any one else. His whole countenance suddenly\nchanged. The solemn and tragic expression with which he had entered\nvanished completely, and a look of something childlike came into his\nface. He seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued. He looked\nshyly and happily at every one, with a continual nervous little laugh,\nand the blissful expression of a dog who has done wrong, been punished,\nand forgiven. He seemed to have forgotten everything, and was looking\nround at every one with a childlike smile of delight. He looked at\nGrushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his chair close up to\nher. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two Poles, though he had\nformed no definite conception of them yet.",
            "3": "The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his\nPolish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. “Well, what of it? It’s a\ngood thing he’s smoking a pipe,” he reflected. The Pole’s puffy,\nmiddle‐aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed\nand impudent‐looking mustaches, had not so far roused the faintest\ndoubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly struck by the Pole’s\nabsurd wig made in Siberia, with love‐locks foolishly combed forward\nover the temples. “I suppose it’s all right since he wears a wig,” he\nwent on, musing blissfully. The other, younger Pole, who was staring\ninsolently and defiantly at the company and listening to the\nconversation with silent contempt, still only impressed Mitya by his\ngreat height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole on the sofa.\n“If he stood up he’d be six foot three.” The thought flitted through\nMitya’s mind. It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the\nfriend of the other, as it were, a “bodyguard,” and no doubt the big\nPole was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all\nseemed to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood\nof doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.\n\nGrushenka’s mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he\ncompletely failed to grasp. All he understood, with thrilling heart,\nwas that she was kind to him, that she had forgiven him, and made him\nsit by her. He was beside himself with delight, watching her sip her\nglass of champagne. The silence of the company seemed somehow to strike\nhim, however, and he looked round at every one with expectant eyes.\n\n“Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don’t you begin doing\nsomething?” his smiling eyes seemed to ask.\n\n“He keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,” Kalganov began\nsuddenly, as though divining his thought, and pointing to Maximov.\n\nMitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov.\n\n“He’s talking nonsense?” he laughed, his short, wooden laugh, seeming\nsuddenly delighted at something—“ha ha!”\n\n“Yes. Would you believe it, he will have it that all our cavalry\nofficers in the twenties married Polish women. That’s awful rot, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“Polish women?” repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic.",
            "4": "Kalganov was well aware of Mitya’s attitude to Grushenka, and he\nguessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him,\nperhaps did not interest him at all; what he was interested in was\nMaximov. He had come here with Maximov by chance, and he met the Poles\nhere at the inn for the first time in his life. Grushenka he knew\nbefore, and had once been with some one to see her; but she had not\ntaken to him. But here she looked at him very affectionately: before\nMitya’s arrival, she had been making much of him, but he seemed somehow\nto be unmoved by it. He was a boy, not over twenty, dressed like a\ndandy, with a very charming fair‐ skinned face, and splendid thick,\nfair hair. From his fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with\nan intelligent and sometimes even deep expression, beyond his age\nindeed, although the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a\nchild, and was not at all ashamed of it, even when he was aware of it\nhimself. As a rule he was very willful, even capricious, though always\nfriendly. Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his\nexpression. He would look at you and listen, seeming all the while to\nbe persistently dreaming over something else. Often he was listless and\nlazy, at other times he would grow excited, sometimes, apparently, over\nthe most trivial matters.\n\n“Only imagine, I’ve been taking him about with me for the last four\ndays,” he went on, indolently drawling his words, quite naturally\nthough, without the slightest affectation. “Ever since your brother, do\nyou remember, shoved him off the carriage and sent him flying. That\nmade me take an interest in him at the time, and I took him into the\ncountry, but he keeps talking such rot I’m ashamed to be with him. I’m\ntaking him back.”\n\n“The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is\nimpossible,” the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.\n\nHe spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he pretended.\nIf he used Russian words, he always distorted them into a Polish form.\n\n“But I was married to a Polish lady myself,” tittered Maximov.\n\n“But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.\nWere you a cavalry officer?” put in Kalganov at once.\n\n“Was he a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha!” cried Mitya, listening\neagerly, and turning his inquiring eyes to each as he spoke, as though\nthere were no knowing what he might hear from each.",
            "5": "“No, you see,” Maximov turned to him. “What I mean is that those pretty\nPolish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when\none of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she jumps on his knee like a\nkitten ... a little white one ... and the _pan_‐father and _pan_‐mother\nlook on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes\nand offers her his hand.... That’s how it is ... offers her his hand,\nhe he!” Maximov ended, tittering.\n\n“The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly\nand crossed one leg over the other. Mitya’s eye was caught by his huge\ngreased boot, with its thick, dirty sole. The dress of both the Poles\nlooked rather greasy.\n\n“Well, now it’s _lajdak_! What’s he scolding about?” said Grushenka,\nsuddenly vexed.\n\n“_Pani_ Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls,\nand not ladies of good birth,” the Pole with the pipe observed to\nGrushenka.\n\n“You can reckon on that,” the tall Pole snapped contemptuously.\n\n“What next! Let him talk! People talk, why hinder them? It makes it\ncheerful,” Grushenka said crossly.\n\n“I’m not hindering them, _pani_,” said the Pole in the wig, with a long\nlook at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his\npipe again.\n\n“No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth.” Kalganov got excited\nagain, as though it were a question of vast import. “He’s never been in\nPoland, so how can he talk about it? I suppose you weren’t married in\nPoland, were you?”\n\n“No, in the Province of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought her to\nRussia before that, my future wife, with her mamma and her aunt, and\nanother female relation with a grown‐up son. He brought her straight\nfrom Poland and gave her up to me. He was a lieutenant in our regiment,\na very nice young man. At first he meant to marry her himself. But he\ndidn’t marry her, because she turned out to be lame.”\n\n“So you married a lame woman?” cried Kalganov.\n\n“Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it.\nI thought she was hopping; she kept hopping.... I thought it was for\nfun.”\n\n“So pleased she was going to marry you!” yelled Kalganov, in a ringing,\nchildish voice.\n\n“Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause.\nAfterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening,\nshe confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. ‘I once jumped\nover a puddle when I was a child,’ she said, ‘and injured my leg.’ He\nhe!”",
            "6": "Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on\nthe sofa. Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of\nhappiness.\n\n“Do you know, that’s the truth, he’s not lying now,” exclaimed\nKalganov, turning to Mitya; “and do you know, he’s been married twice;\nit’s his first wife he’s talking about. But his second wife, do you\nknow, ran away, and is alive now.”\n\n“Is it possible?” said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an\nexpression of the utmost astonishment.\n\n“Yes. She did run away. I’ve had that unpleasant experience,” Maximov\nmodestly assented, “with a _monsieur_. And what was worse, she’d had\nall my little property transferred to her beforehand. ‘You’re an\neducated man,’ she said to me. ‘You can always get your living.’ She\nsettled my business with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: ‘One\nof your wives was lame, but the other was too light‐footed.’ He he!”\n\n“Listen, listen!” cried Kalganov, bubbling over, “if he’s telling\nlies—and he often is—he’s only doing it to amuse us all. There’s no\nharm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He’s awfully\nlow, but it’s natural to him, eh? Don’t you think so? Some people are\nlow from self‐ interest, but he’s simply so, from nature. Only fancy,\nhe claims (he was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol\nwrote _Dead Souls_ about him. Do you remember, there’s a landowner\ncalled Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you\nremember, ‘for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner\nMaximov in a drunken condition.’ Would you believe it, he claims that\nhe was that Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so?\nTchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of\nthe twenties, so that the dates don’t fit. He couldn’t have been\nthrashed then, he couldn’t, could he?”\n\nIt was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his\nexcitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.\n\n“Well, but if they did thrash him!” he cried, laughing.\n\n“It’s not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is—” put in\nMaximov.\n\n“What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn’t.”\n\n“What o’clock is it, _panie_?” the Pole, with the pipe, asked his tall\nfriend, with a bored expression. The other shrugged his shoulders in\nreply. Neither of them had a watch.",
            "7": "“Why not talk? Let other people talk. Mustn’t other people talk because\nyou’re bored?” Grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding\nfault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya’s mind.\nThis time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability.\n\n“_Pani_, I didn’t oppose it. I didn’t say anything.”\n\n“All right then. Come, tell us your story,” Grushenka cried to Maximov.\n“Why are you all silent?”\n\n“There’s nothing to tell, it’s all so foolish,” answered Maximov at\nonce, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little. “Besides, all that’s\nby way of allegory in Gogol, for he’s made all the names have a\nmeaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a\ndifferent name, he was called Shkvornev. Fenardi really was called\nFenardi, only he wasn’t an Italian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi\nwas a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights, and she had a\nlittle short skirt with spangles, and she kept turning round and round,\nonly not for four hours but for four minutes only, and she bewitched\nevery one...”\n\n“But what were you beaten for?” cried Kalganov.\n\n“For Piron!” answered Maximov.\n\n“What Piron?” cried Mitya.\n\n“The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big\nparty of us, in a tavern at that very fair. They’d invited me, and\nfirst of all I began quoting epigrams. ‘Is that you, Boileau? What a\nfunny get‐up!’ and Boileau answers that he’s going to a masquerade,\nthat is to the baths, he he! And they took it to themselves, so I made\nhaste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well known to all educated\npeople:\n\nYes, Sappho and Phaon are we!\nBut one grief is weighing on me.\nYou don’t know your way to the sea!\n\n\nThey were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly\nway for it. And as ill‐luck would have it, to set things right, I began\ntelling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he was not accepted\ninto the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph:\n\nCi‐gît Piron qui ne fut rien,\nPas même académicien.\n\n\nThey seized me and thrashed me.”\n\n“But what for? What for?”\n\n“For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,” Maximov\nconcluded, briefly and sententiously.\n\n“Eh, that’s enough! That’s all stupid, I don’t want to listen. I\nthought it would be amusing,” Grushenka cut them short, suddenly.",
            "8": "Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. The tall Pole rose upon\nhis feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his\nelement, began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his hands\nbehind his back.\n\n“Ah, he can’t sit still,” said Grushenka, looking at him\ncontemptuously. Mitya began to feel anxious. He noticed besides, that\nthe Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression.\n\n“_Panie!_” cried Mitya, “let’s drink! and the other _pan_, too! Let us\ndrink.”\n\nIn a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him, and filled them\nwith champagne.\n\n“To Poland, _panovie_, I drink to your Poland!” cried Mitya.\n\n“I shall be delighted, _panie_,” said the Pole on the sofa, with\ndignity and affable condescension, and he took his glass.\n\n“And the other _pan_, what’s his name? Drink, most illustrious, take\nyour glass!” Mitya urged.\n\n“Pan Vrublevsky,” put in the Pole on the sofa.\n\nPan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he walked.\n\n“To Poland, _panovie!_” cried Mitya, raising his glass. “Hurrah!”\n\nAll three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three\nglasses.\n\n“Now to Russia, _panovie_, and let us be brothers!”\n\n“Pour out some for us,” said Grushenka; “I’ll drink to Russia, too!”\n\n“So will I,” said Kalganov.\n\n“And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother!” tittered\nMaximov.\n\n“All! All!” cried Mitya. “Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!”\n\nThe other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the\ntable. Mitya filled the glasses.\n\n“To Russia! Hurrah!” he shouted again. All drank the toast except the\nPoles, and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once. The Poles did\nnot touch theirs.\n\n“How’s this, _panovie_?” cried Mitya, “won’t you drink it?”\n\nPan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant\nvoice:\n\n“To Russia as she was before 1772.”\n\n“Come, that’s better!” cried the other Pole, and they both emptied\ntheir glasses at once.\n\n“You’re fools, you _panovie_,” broke suddenly from Mitya.\n\n“_Panie!_” shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a\ncouple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious.\n\n“Can one help loving one’s own country?” he shouted.\n\n“Be silent! Don’t quarrel! I won’t have any quarreling!” cried\nGrushenka imperiously, and she stamped her foot on the floor. Her face\nglowed, her eyes were shining. The effects of the glass she had just\ndrunk were apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed.\n\n“_Panovie_, forgive me! It was my fault, I’m sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_\nVrublevsky, I’m sorry.”",
            "9": "“Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!” Grushenka\nscolded with angry annoyance.\n\nEvery one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.\n\n“Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,” Mitya began again, unable to\nmake anything of Grushenka’s words. “Come, why are we sitting here?\nWhat shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again?”\n\n“Ach, it’s certainly anything but amusing!” Kalganov mumbled lazily.\n\n“Let’s play faro again, as we did just now,” Maximov tittered suddenly.\n\n“Faro? Splendid!” cried Mitya. “If only the _panovie_—”\n\n“It’s lite, _panovie_,” the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were\nunwillingly.\n\n“That’s true,” assented Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n“Lite? What do you mean by ‘lite’?” asked Grushenka.\n\n“Late, _pani_! ‘a late hour’ I mean,” the Pole on the sofa explained.\n\n“It’s always late with them. They can never do anything!” Grushenka\nalmost shrieked in her anger. “They’re dull themselves, so they want\nothers to be dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and\nkept turning up their noses at me.”\n\n“My goddess!” cried the Pole on the sofa, “I see you’re not\nwell‐disposed to me, that’s why I’m gloomy. I’m ready, _panie_,” added\nhe, addressing Mitya.\n\n“Begin, _panie_,” Mitya assented, pulling his notes out of his pocket,\nand laying two hundred‐rouble notes on the table. “I want to lose a lot\nto you. Take your cards. Make the bank.”\n\n“We’ll have cards from the landlord, _panie_,” said the little Pole,\ngravely and emphatically.\n\n“That’s much the best way,” chimed in Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n“From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let’s get them from him.\nCards!” Mitya shouted to the landlord.\n\nThe landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that\nthe girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would\nmost likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet\narrived. Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to\ngive orders, but only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there\nyet. And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run\nout. He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the\ngirls, the sweets, the toffee and the fondants. “And vodka for Andrey,\nvodka for Andrey!” he cried in haste. “I was rude to Andrey!”\n\nSuddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, touched him on the\nshoulder.\n\n“Give me five roubles,” he whispered to Mitya. “I’ll stake something at\nfaro, too, he he!”\n\n“Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!”",
            "10": "Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for\nten roubles. “And if you lose that, come again, come again.”\n\n“Very good,” Maximov whispered joyfully, and he ran back again. Mitya,\ntoo, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had\nalready sat down, and opened the pack. They looked much more amiable,\nalmost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was\npreparing to throw. He wore an air of solemnity.\n\n“To your places, gentlemen,” cried Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n“No, I’m not going to play any more,” observed Kalganov, “I’ve lost\nfifty roubles to them just now.”\n\n“The _pan_ had no luck, perhaps he’ll be lucky this time,” the Pole on\nthe sofa observed in his direction.\n\n“How much in the bank? To correspond?” asked Mitya.\n\n“That’s according, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much\nas you will stake.”\n\n“A million!” laughed Mitya.\n\n“The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?”\n\n“What Podvysotsky?”\n\n“In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.\nPodvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the\nbank. The banker says, ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you laying down the\ngold, or must we trust to your honor?’ ‘To my honor, _panie_,’ says\nPodvysotsky. ‘So much the better.’ The banker throws the dice.\nPodvysotsky wins. ‘Take it, _panie_,’ says the banker, and pulling out\nthe drawer he gives him a million. ‘Take it, _panie_, this is your\ngain.’ There was a million in the bank. ‘I didn’t know that,’ says\nPodvysotsky. ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky,’ said the banker, ‘you pledged your\nhonor and we pledged ours.’ Podvysotsky took the million.”\n\n“That’s not true,” said Kalganov.\n\n“_Panie_ Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn’t say such things.”\n\n“As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!” cried Mitya, but\nchecked himself at once. “Forgive me, _panie_, it’s my fault again, he\nwould, he would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor. You\nsee how I talk Polish, ha ha! Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave\nleads.”\n\n“And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty\nlittle _panienotchka_, he he!” laughed Maximov, pulling out his queen,\nand, as though trying to conceal it from every one, he moved right up\nand crossed himself hurriedly under the table. Mitya won. The rouble\nwon, too.\n\n“A corner!” cried Mitya.\n\n“I’ll bet another rouble, a ‘single’ stake,” Maximov muttered\ngleefully, hugely delighted at having won a rouble.",
            "11": "“Lost!” shouted Mitya. “A ‘double’ on the seven!”\n\nThe seven too was trumped.\n\n“Stop!” cried Kalganov suddenly.\n\n“Double! Double!” Mitya doubled his stakes, and each time he doubled\nthe stake, the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles. The rouble\nstakes kept winning.\n\n“On the double!” shouted Mitya furiously.\n\n“You’ve lost two hundred, _panie_. Will you stake another hundred?” the\nPole on the sofa inquired.\n\n“What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All\ndoubles!”\n\nAnd pulling his money out of his pocket, Mitya was about to fling two\nhundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his hand.\n\n“That’s enough!” he shouted in his ringing voice.\n\n“What’s the matter?” Mitya stared at him.\n\n“That’s enough! I don’t want you to play any more. Don’t!”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I don’t. Hang it, come away. That’s why. I won’t let you go on\nplaying.”\n\nMitya gazed at him in astonishment.\n\n“Give it up, Mitya. He may be right. You’ve lost a lot as it is,” said\nGrushenka, with a curious note in her voice. Both the Poles rose from\ntheir seats with a deeply offended air.\n\n“Are you joking, _panie_?” said the short man, looking severely at\nKalganov.\n\n“How dare you!” Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov.\n\n“Don’t dare to shout like that,” cried Grushenka. “Ah, you\nturkey‐cocks!”\n\nMitya looked at each of them in turn. But something in Grushenka’s face\nsuddenly struck him, and at the same instant something new flashed into\nhis mind—a strange new thought!\n\n“_Pani_ Agrippina,” the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger,\nwhen Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder.\n\n“Most illustrious, two words with you.”\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“In the next room, I’ve two words to say to you, something pleasant,\nvery pleasant. You’ll be glad to hear it.”\n\nThe little _pan_ was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He\nagreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with\nthem.\n\n“The bodyguard? Let him come, and I want him, too. I must have him!”\ncried Mitya. “March, _panovie_!”\n\n“Where are you going?” asked Grushenka, anxiously.\n\n“We’ll be back in one moment,” answered Mitya.\n\nThere was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his eyes.\nHis face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour\nbefore.",
            "12": "He led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was\nassembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the\nright, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two\nlarge beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each. There was a\nlighted candle on a small deal table in the corner. The small man and\nMitya sat down to this table, facing each other, while the huge\nVrublevsky stood beside them, his hands behind his back. The Poles\nlooked severe but were evidently inquisitive.\n\n“What can I do for you, _panie_?” lisped the little Pole.\n\n“Well, look here, _panie_, I won’t keep you long. There’s money for\nyou,” he pulled out his notes. “Would you like three thousand? Take it\nand go your way.”\n\nThe Pole gazed open‐eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.\n\n“Three thousand, _panie_?” He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky.\n\n“Three, _panovie_, three! Listen, _panie_, I see you’re a sensible man.\nTake three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you—d’you\nhear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever. You understand\nthat, _panie_, for ever. Here’s the door, you go out of it. What have\nyou got there, a great‐coat, a fur coat? I’ll bring it out to you.\nThey’ll get the horses out directly, and then—good‐by, _panie_!”\n\nMitya awaited an answer with assurance. He had no doubts. An expression\nof extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole’s face.\n\n“And the money, _panie_?”\n\n“The money, _panie_? Five hundred roubles I’ll give you this moment for\nthe journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred\nto‐ morrow, in the town—I swear on my honor, I’ll get it, I’ll get it\nat any cost!” cried Mitya.\n\nThe Poles exchanged glances again. The short man’s face looked more\nforbidding.\n\n“Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute,\ncash down!” Mitya added, feeling something wrong. “What’s the matter,\n_panie_? Don’t you trust me? I can’t give you the whole three thousand\nstraight off. If I give it, you may come back to her to‐morrow....\nBesides, I haven’t the three thousand with me. I’ve got it at home in\nthe town,” faltered Mitya, his spirit sinking at every word he uttered.\n“Upon my word, the money’s there, hidden.”\n\nIn an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself\nin the little man’s face.\n\n“What next?” he asked ironically. “For shame!” and he spat on the\nfloor. Pan Vrublevsky spat too.",
            "13": "“You do that, _panie_,” said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all\nwas over, “because you hope to make more out of Grushenka? You’re a\ncouple of capons, that’s what you are!”\n\n“This is a mortal insult!” The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and\nhe went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another\nword. Vrublevsky swung out after him, and Mitya followed, confused and\ncrestfallen. He was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the _pan_ would at\nonce raise an outcry. And so indeed he did. The Pole walked into the\nroom and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka.\n\n“_Pani_ Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult!” he exclaimed. But\nGrushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her in\nthe tenderest spot.\n\n“Speak Russian! Speak Russian!” she cried, “not another word of Polish!\nYou used to talk Russian. You can’t have forgotten it in five years.”\n\nShe was red with passion.\n\n“_Pani_ Agrippina—”\n\n“My name’s Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won’t listen!”\n\nThe Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously\ndelivered himself in broken Russian:\n\n“_Pani_ Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to\nforget all that has happened till to‐day—”\n\n“Forgive? Came here to forgive me?” Grushenka cut him short, jumping up\nfrom her seat.\n\n“Just so, _pani_, I’m not pusillanimous, I’m magnanimous. But I was\nastounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand,\nin the other room to depart. I spat in the _pan’s_ face.”\n\n“What? He offered you money for me?” cried Grushenka, hysterically. “Is\nit true, Mitya? How dare you? Am I for sale?”\n\n“_Panie, panie!_” yelled Mitya, “she’s pure and shining, and I have\nnever been her lover! That’s a lie....”\n\n“How dare you defend me to him?” shrieked Grushenka. “It wasn’t virtue\nkept me pure, and it wasn’t that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I\nmight hold up my head when I met him, and tell him he’s a scoundrel.\nAnd he did actually refuse the money?”\n\n“He took it! He took it!” cried Mitya; “only he wanted to get the whole\nthree thousand at once, and I could only give him seven hundred\nstraight off.”\n\n“I see: he heard I had money, and came here to marry me!”\n\n“_Pani_ Agrippina!” cried the little Pole. “I’m—a knight, I’m—a\nnobleman, and not a _lajdak_. I came here to make you my wife and I\nfind you a different woman, perverse and shameless.”",
            "14": "“Oh, go back where you came from! I’ll tell them to turn you out and\nyou’ll be turned out,” cried Grushenka, furious. “I’ve been a fool, a\nfool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn’t for his\nsake, it was my anger made me miserable. And this isn’t he at all! Was\nhe like this? It might be his father! Where did you get your wig from?\nHe was a falcon, but this is a gander. He used to laugh and sing to\nme.... And I’ve been crying for five years, damned fool, abject,\nshameless I was!”\n\nShe sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands. At that\ninstant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left—a\nrollicking dance song.\n\n“A regular Sodom!” Vrublevsky roared suddenly. “Landlord, send the\nshameless hussies away!”\n\nThe landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in\nat the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were\nquarreling, at once entered the room.\n\n“What are you shouting for? D’you want to split your throat?” he said,\naddressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness.\n\n“Animal!” bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.\n\n“Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now? I gave\nyou a pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! I could send\nyou to Siberia for playing with false cards, d’you know that, for it’s\njust the same as false banknotes....”\n\nAnd going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back\nand the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.\n\n“Here’s my pack unopened!”\n\nHe held it up and showed it to all in the room. “From where I stood I\nsaw him slip my pack away, and put his in place of it—you’re a cheat\nand not a gentleman!”\n\n“And I twice saw the _pan_ change a card!” cried Kalganov.\n\n“How shameful! How shameful!” exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her hands,\nand blushing for genuine shame. “Good Lord, he’s come to that!”\n\n“I thought so, too!” said Mitya. But before he had uttered the words,\nVrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his fist at\nGrushenka, shouting:\n\n“You low harlot!”\n\nMitya flew at him at once, clutched him in both hands, lifted him in\nthe air, and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right,\nfrom which they had just come.\n\n“I’ve laid him on the floor, there,” he announced, returning at once,\ngasping with excitement. “He’s struggling, the scoundrel! But he won’t\ncome back, no fear of that!...”\n\nHe closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar\ncalled out to the little Pole:",
            "15": "“Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?”\n\n“My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said Trifon Borissovitch, “make them\ngive you back the money you lost. It’s as good as stolen from you.”\n\n“I don’t want my fifty roubles back,” Kalganov declared suddenly.\n\n“I don’t want my two hundred, either,” cried Mitya, “I wouldn’t take it\nfor anything! Let him keep it as a consolation.”\n\n“Bravo, Mitya! You’re a trump, Mitya!” cried Grushenka, and there was a\nnote of fierce anger in the exclamation.\n\nThe little _pan_, crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity,\nwas making for the door, but he stopped short and said suddenly,\naddressing Grushenka:\n\n“_Pani_, if you want to come with me, come. If not, good‐by.”\n\nAnd swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door. This\nwas a man of character: he had so good an opinion of himself that after\nall that had passed, he still expected that she would marry him. Mitya\nslammed the door after him.\n\n“Lock it,” said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they\nhad locked it from within.\n\n“That’s capital!” exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. “Serve them right!”"

        "title": "VIII.\nDelirium",
        "content": {
            "0": "What followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.\nGrushenka was the first to call for wine.\n\n“I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before. Do you\nremember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!”\n\nMitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his happiness was at\nhand. But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her.\n\n“Go and enjoy yourself. Tell them to dance, to make merry, ‘let the\nstove and cottage dance’; as we had it last time,” she kept exclaiming.\nShe was tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her. The\nchorus were in the next room. The room in which they had been sitting\ntill that moment was too small, and was divided in two by cotton\ncurtains, behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and\na pyramid of cotton pillows. In the four rooms for visitors there were\nbeds. Grushenka settled herself just at the door. Mitya set an easy\nchair for her. She had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and\nsinging “the time before,” when they had made merry there. All the\ngirls who had come had been there then; the Jewish band with fiddles\nand zithers had come, too, and at last the long expected cart had\narrived with the wines and provisions.\n\nMitya bustled about. All sorts of people began coming into the room to\nlook on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep and\nattracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they\nhad enjoyed a month before. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting and\nembracing every one he knew. He uncorked bottles and poured out wine\nfor every one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for\nthe champagne. The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot\npunch. Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that\nthree samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and\npunch for everyone to help himself.",
            "1": "An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his natural\nelement, and the more foolish it became, the more his spirits rose. If\nthe peasants had asked him for money at that moment, he would have\npulled out his notes and given them away right and left. This was\nprobably why the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about\nMitya to protect him. He seemed to have given up all idea of going to\nbed that night; but he drank little, only one glass of punch, and kept\na sharp look‐out on Mitya’s interests after his own fashion. He\nintervened in the nick of time, civilly and obsequiously persuading\nMitya not to give away “cigars and Rhine wine,” and, above all, money\nto the peasants as he had done before. He was very indignant, too, at\nthe peasant girls drinking liqueur, and eating sweets.\n\n“They’re a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” he said. “I’d give them a\nkick, every one of them, and they’d take it as an honor—that’s all\nthey’re worth!”\n\nMitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him.\n“I was rude to him just now,” he repeated with a sinking, softened\nvoice. Kalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for\nthe girls’ singing; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of\nchampagne he became extraordinarily lively, strolling about the room,\nlaughing and praising the music and the songs, admiring every one and\neverything. Maximov, blissfully drunk, never left his side. Grushenka,\ntoo, was beginning to get drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she said to\nMitya:\n\n“What a dear, charming boy he is!”\n\nAnd Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were\nhis hopes! She had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to\nrefrain from speaking. But she looked at him from time to time with\ncaressing and passionate eyes. At last she suddenly gripped his hand\nand drew him vigorously to her. She was sitting at the moment in the\nlow chair by the door.\n\n“How was it you came just now, eh? Have you walked in!... I was\nfrightened. So you wanted to give me up to him, did you? Did you really\nwant to?”\n\n“I didn’t want to spoil your happiness!” Mitya faltered blissfully. But\nshe did not need his answer.\n\n“Well, go and enjoy yourself ...” she sent him away once more. “Don’t\ncry, I’ll call you back again.”\n\nHe would run away, and she listened to the singing and looked at the\ndancing, though her eyes followed him wherever he went. But in another\nquarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run\nback to her.",
            "2": "“Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my coming\nhere yesterday? From whom did you first hear it?”\n\nAnd Mitya began telling her all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently,\nfeverishly. He spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.\n\n“What are you frowning at?” she asked.\n\n“Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I’d give ten years of my life for\nhim to get well, to know he was all right!”\n\n“Well, never mind him, if he’s ill. So you meant to shoot yourself to‐\nmorrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows as\nyou,” she lisped, with a rather halting tongue. “So you would go any\nlength for me, eh? Did you really mean to shoot yourself to‐morrow, you\nstupid? No, wait a little. To‐morrow I may have something to say to\nyou.... I won’t say it to‐day, but to‐morrow. You’d like it to be\nto‐day? No, I don’t want to to‐day. Come, go along now, go and amuse\nyourself.”\n\nOnce, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy.\n\n“Why are you sad? I see you’re sad.... Yes, I see it,” she added,\nlooking intently into his eyes. “Though you keep kissing the peasants\nand shouting, I see something. No, be merry. I’m merry; you be merry,\ntoo.... I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has\nfallen asleep, poor dear, he’s drunk.”\n\nShe meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for\na moment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink;\nhe felt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, “bored.” He was intensely\ndepressed by the girls’ songs, which, as the drinking went on,\ngradually became coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad.\nTwo girls dressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida,\nwith a stick in her hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to “show\nthem.”\n\n“Look alive, Marya, or you’ll get the stick!”\n\nThe bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion,\namid roars of laughter from the closely‐packed crowd of men and women.\n\n“Well, let them! Let them!” said Grushenka sententiously, with an\necstatic expression on her face. “When they do get a day to enjoy\nthemselves, why shouldn’t folks be happy?”\n\nKalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt.\n\n“It’s swinish, all this peasant foolery,” he murmured, moving away;\n“it’s the game they play when it’s light all night in summer.”",
            "3": "He particularly disliked one “new” song to a jaunty dance‐tune. It\ndescribed how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to\nsee whether they would love him:\n\nThe master came to try the girls:\nWould they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut the girls could not love the master:\n\nHe would beat me cruelly\nAnd such love won’t do for me.\n\n\nThen a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries:\n\nThe gypsy came to try the girls:\nWould they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut they couldn’t love the gypsy either:\n\nHe would be a thief, I fear,\nAnd would cause me many a tear.\n\n\nAnd many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier:\n\nThe soldier came to try the girls:\nWould they love him, would they not?\n\n\nBut the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung\nwith absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The\nsong ends with a merchant:\n\nThe merchant came to try the girls:\nWould they love him, would they not?\n\n\nAnd it appears that he wins their love because:\n\nThe merchant will make gold for me\nAnd his queen I’ll gladly be.\n\n\nKalvanov was positively indignant.\n\n“That’s just a song of yesterday,” he said aloud. “Who writes such\nthings for them? They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew\ncome to try his luck with the girls; they’d have carried all before\nthem.”\n\nAnd, almost as though it were a personal affront, he declared, on the\nspot, that he was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell\nasleep. His pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on\nthe sofa cushion.\n\n“Look how pretty he is,” said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him. “I was\ncombing his hair just now; his hair’s like flax, and so thick....”\n\nAnd, bending over him tenderly, she kissed his forehead. Kalganov\ninstantly opened his eyes, looked at her, stood up, and with the most\nanxious air inquired where was Maximov?\n\n“So that’s who it is you want.” Grushenka laughed. “Stay with me a\nminute. Mitya, run and find his Maximov.”\n\nMaximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, only\nrunning away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur.\nHe had drunk two cups of chocolate. His face was red, and his nose was\ncrimson; his eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet. He ran up and\nannounced that he was going to dance the “sabotière.”\n\n“They taught me all those well‐bred, aristocratic dances when I was\nlittle....”\n\n“Go, go with him, Mitya, and I’ll watch from here how he dances,” said\nGrushenka.",
            "4": "“No, no, I’m coming to look on, too,” exclaimed Kalganov, brushing\naside in the most naïve way Grushenka’s offer to sit with him. They all\nwent to look on. Maximov danced his dance. But it roused no great\nadmiration in any one but Mitya. It consisted of nothing but skipping\nand hopping, kicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the\nupturned sole of his foot. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya\nkissed the dancer.\n\n“Thanks. You’re tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would you\nlike some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?”\n\n“A cigarette.”\n\n“Don’t you want a drink?”\n\n“I’ll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?”\n\n“Yes, there’s a heap of them on the table there. Choose one, my dear\nsoul!”\n\n“I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He he!”\n\n“No, brother, we’ve none of that special sort.”\n\n“I say,” the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya’s ear. “That girl\nthere, little Marya, he he! How would it be if you were to help me make\nfriends with her?”\n\n“So that’s what you’re after! No, brother, that won’t do!”\n\n“I’d do no harm to any one,” Maximov muttered disconsolately.\n\n“Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, you\nknow, brother. But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be\nmerry, meanwhile. Don’t you want money?”\n\n“Later on, perhaps,” smiled Maximov.\n\n“All right, all right....”\n\nMitya’s head was burning. He went outside to the wooden balcony which\nran round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the\ncourtyard. The fresh air revived him. He stood alone in a dark corner,\nand suddenly clutched his head in both hands. His scattered thoughts\ncame together; his sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden\nlight into his mind. A fearful and terrible light! “If I’m to shoot\nmyself, why not now?” passed through his mind. “Why not go for the\npistols, bring them here, and here, in this dark dirty corner, make an\nend?” Almost a minute he stood, undecided. A few hours earlier, when he\nhad been dashing here, he was pursued by disgrace, by the theft he had\ncommitted, and that blood, that blood!... But yet it was easier for him\nthen. Then everything was over: he had lost her, given her up. She was\ngone, for him—oh, then his death sentence had been easier for him; at\nleast it had seemed necessary, inevitable, for what had he to stay on\nearth for?",
            "5": "But now? Was it the same as then? Now one phantom, one terror at least\nwas at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had\nvanished, leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had turned into\nsomething so small, so comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and\nlocked in. It would never return. She was ashamed, and from her eyes he\ncould see now whom she loved. Now he had everything to make life happy\n... but he could not go on living, he could not; oh, damnation! “O God!\nrestore to life the man I knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful\ncup pass from me! Lord, thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as\nme! But what, what if the old man’s alive? Oh, then the shame of the\nother disgrace I would wipe away. I would restore the stolen money. I’d\ngive it back; I’d get it somehow.... No trace of that shame will remain\nexcept in my heart for ever! But no, no; oh, impossible cowardly\ndreams! Oh, damnation!”\n\nYet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness. He jumped up and\nran back to the room—to her, to her, his queen for ever! Was not one\nmoment of her love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies of\ndisgrace? This wild question clutched at his heart. “To her, to her\nalone, to see her, to hear her, to think of nothing, to forget\neverything, if only for that night, for an hour, for a moment!” Just as\nhe turned from the balcony into the passage, he came upon the landlord,\nTrifon Borissovitch. He thought he looked gloomy and worried, and\nfancied he had come to find him.\n\n“What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?”\n\n“No, sir.” The landlord seemed disconcerted. “Why should I be looking\nfor you? Where have you been?”\n\n“Why do you look so glum? You’re not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you\nshall soon get to bed.... What’s the time?”\n\n“It’ll be three o’clock. Past three, it must be.”\n\n“We’ll leave off soon. We’ll leave off.”\n\n“Don’t mention it; it doesn’t matter. Keep it up as long as you\nlike....”",
            "6": "“What’s the matter with him?” Mitya wondered for an instant, and he ran\nback to the room where the girls were dancing. But she was not there.\nShe was not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov\nasleep on the sofa. Mitya peeped behind the curtain—she was there. She\nwas sitting in the corner, on a trunk. Bent forward, with her head and\narms on the bed close by, she was crying bitterly, doing her utmost to\nstifle her sobs that she might not be heard. Seeing Mitya, she beckoned\nhim to her, and when he ran to her, she grasped his hand tightly.\n\n“Mitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these five\nyears, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him,\nhim! It’s a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was\nonly seventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to\nme.... Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord,\nit’s not the same man. Even his face is not the same; he’s different\naltogether. I shouldn’t have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and\nall the way I was thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to\nhim, how we should look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a\nsudden it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over\nme. He talked to me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he\nmet me so solemnly that I was struck dumb. I couldn’t get a word in. At\nfirst I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big Pole. I sat\nstaring at him and wondering why I couldn’t say a word to him now. It\nmust have been his wife that ruined him; you know he threw me up to get\nmarried. She must have changed him like that. Mitya, how shameful it\nis! Oh, Mitya, I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed for all my life. Curse it,\ncurse it, curse those five years!”\n\nAnd again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya’s hand and did\nnot let it go.\n\n“Mitya, darling, stay, don’t go away. I want to say one word to you,”\nshe whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him. “Listen, tell me\nwho it is I love? I love one man here. Who is that man? That’s what you\nmust tell me.”\n\nA smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping, and her eyes\nshone in the half darkness.",
            "7": "“A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. ‘Fool! that’s the man you love!’\nThat was what my heart whispered to me at once. You came in and all\ngrew bright. What’s he afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened;\nyou couldn’t speak. It’s not them he’s afraid of—could you be\nfrightened of any one? It’s me he’s afraid of, I thought, only me. So\nFenya told you, you little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the\nwindow that I’d loved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now\nto love ... another. Mitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to\nthink I could love any one after you? Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you\nforgive me or not? Do you love me? Do you love me?” She jumped up and\nheld him with both hands on his shoulders. Mitya, dumb with rapture,\ngazed into her eyes, at her face, at her smile, and suddenly clasped\nher tightly in his arms and kissed her passionately.\n\n“You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite I\ntormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of his\nmind.... Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke\nthe wine‐glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to‐day and drank\n‘to my vile heart.’ Mitya, my falcon, why don’t you kiss me? He kissed\nme once, and now he draws back and looks and listens. Why listen to me?\nKiss me, kiss me hard, that’s right. If you love, well, then, love!\nI’ll be your slave now, your slave for the rest of my life. It’s sweet\nto be a slave. Kiss me! Beat me, ill‐treat me, do what you will with\nme.... And I do deserve to suffer. Stay, wait, afterwards, I won’t have\nthat....” she suddenly thrust him away. “Go along, Mitya, I’ll come and\nhave some wine, I want to be drunk, I’m going to get drunk and dance; I\nmust, I must!” She tore herself away from him and disappeared behind\nthe curtain. Mitya followed like a drunken man.\n\n“Yes, come what may—whatever may happen now, for one minute I’d give\nthe whole world,” he thought. Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole\nglass of champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She sat\ndown in the same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her face.\nHer cheeks were glowing, her lips were burning, her flashing eyes were\nmoist; there was passionate appeal in her eyes. Even Kalganov felt a\nstir at the heart and went up to her.",
            "8": "“Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now?” she said\nthickly. “I’m drunk now, that’s what it is.... And aren’t you drunk?\nAnd why isn’t Mitya drinking? Why don’t you drink, Mitya? I’m drunk,\nand you don’t drink....”\n\n“I am drunk! I’m drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I’ll be\ndrunk with wine, too.”\n\nHe drank off another glass, and—he thought it strange himself—that\nglass made him completely drunk. He was suddenly drunk, although till\nthat moment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that\nmoment everything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He\nwalked, laughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was\ndoing. Only one persistent burning sensation made itself felt\ncontinually, “like a red‐hot coal in his heart,” he said afterwards. He\nwent up to her, sat beside her, gazed at her, listened to her.... She\nbecame very talkative, kept calling every one to her, and beckoned to\ndifferent girls out of the chorus. When the girl came up, she either\nkissed her, or made the sign of the cross over her. In another minute\nshe might have cried. She was greatly amused by the “little old man,”\nas she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to kiss her hands, “each\nlittle finger,” and finally he danced another dance to an old song,\nwhich he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to the refrain:\n\nThe little pig says—umph! umph! umph!\nThe little calf says—moo, moo, moo,\nThe little duck says—quack, quack, quack,\nThe little goose says—ga, ga, ga.\nThe hen goes strutting through the porch;\nTroo‐roo‐roo‐roo‐roo, she’ll say,\nTroo‐roo‐roo‐roo‐roo, she’ll say!",
            "9": "\n“Give him something, Mitya,” said Grushenka. “Give him a present, he’s\npoor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I\nshall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said\nsomething to me to‐day that I shall remember all my life.... Yes....\nBut to‐day let us dance. To‐morrow to the nunnery, but to‐day we’ll\ndance. I want to play to‐day, good people, and what of it? God will\nforgive us. If I were God, I’d forgive every one: ‘My dear sinners,\nfrom this day forth I forgive you.’ I’m going to beg forgiveness:\n‘Forgive me, good people, a silly wench.’ I’m a beast, that’s what I\nam. But I want to pray. I gave a little onion. Wicked as I’ve been, I\nwant to pray. Mitya, let them dance, don’t stop them. Every one in the\nworld is good. Every one—even the worst of them. The world’s a nice\nplace. Though we’re bad the world’s all right. We’re good and bad, good\nand bad.... Come, tell me, I’ve something to ask you: come here every\none, and I’ll ask you: Why am I so good? You know I am good. I’m very\ngood.... Come, why am I so good?”\n\nSo Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk. At last she\nannounced that she was going to dance, too. She got up from her chair,\nstaggering. “Mitya, don’t give me any more wine—if I ask you, don’t\ngive it to me. Wine doesn’t give peace. Everything’s going round, the\nstove, and everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance\n... let them see how beautifully I dance....”\n\nShe really meant it. She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her\npocket, and took it by one corner in her right hand, to wave it in the\ndance. Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to\nbreak into a dancing song at the first signal. Maximov, hearing that\nGrushenka wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping\nabout in front of her, humming:\n\nWith legs so slim and sides so trim\nAnd its little tail curled tight.\n\n\nBut Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away.\n\n“Sh‐h! Mitya, why don’t they come? Let every one come ... to look on.\nCall them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in?\nTell them I’m going to dance. Let them look on, too....”\n\nMitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began\nknocking to the Poles with his fist.\n\n“Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she’s going to dance. She calls you.”\n\n“_Lajdak!_” one of the Poles shouted in reply.\n\n“You’re a _lajdak_ yourself! You’re a little scoundrel, that’s what you\nare.”",
            "10": "“Leave off laughing at Poland,” said Kalganov sententiously. He too was\ndrunk.\n\n“Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, it doesn’t mean that I\ncalled all Poland so. One _lajdak_ doesn’t make a Poland. Be quiet, my\npretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.”\n\n“Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men. Why won’t they make\nfriends?” said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke\ninto “Ah, my porch, my new porch!” Grushenka flung back her head, half\nopened her lips, smiled, waved her handkerchief, and suddenly, with a\nviolent lurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking\nbewildered.\n\n“I’m weak....” she said in an exhausted voice. “Forgive me.... I’m\nweak, I can’t.... I’m sorry.”\n\nShe bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.\n\n“I’m sorry.... Forgive me....”\n\n“The lady’s been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,” voices\nwere heard saying.\n\n“The lady’s drunk too much,” Maximov explained to the girls, giggling.\n\n“Mitya, lead me away ... take me,” said Grushenka helplessly. Mitya\npounced on her, snatched her up in his arms, and carried the precious\nburden through the curtains.\n\n“Well, now I’ll go,” thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue\nroom, he closed the two halves of the door after him. But the orgy in\nthe larger room went on and grew louder and louder. Mitya laid\nGrushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips.\n\n“Don’t touch me....” she faltered, in an imploring voice. “Don’t touch\nme, till I’m yours.... I’ve told you I’m yours, but don’t touch me ...\nspare me.... With them here, with them close, you mustn’t. He’s here.\nIt’s nasty here....”\n\n“I’ll obey you! I won’t think of it ... I worship you!” muttered Mitya.\n“Yes, it’s nasty here, it’s abominable.”\n\nAnd still holding her in his arms, he sank on his knees by the bedside.\n\n“I know, though you’re a brute, you’re generous,” Grushenka articulated\nwith difficulty. “It must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for\nthe future ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but\ngood ... take me away, take me far away, do you hear? I don’t want it\nto be here, but far, far away....”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes, it must be!” said Mitya, pressing her in his arms. “I’ll\ntake you and we’ll fly away.... Oh, I’d give my whole life for one year\nonly to know about that blood!”\n\n“What blood?” asked Grushenka, bewildered.\n\n“Nothing,” muttered Mitya, through his teeth. “Grusha, you wanted to be\nhonest, but I’m a thief. But I’ve stolen money from Katya.... Disgrace,\na disgrace!”",
            "11": "“From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn’t steal it. Give it her\nback, take it from me.... Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is\nyours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like\nus are bound to waste money. But we’d better go and work the land. I\nwant to dig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear?\nAlyosha said so. I won’t be your mistress, I’ll be faithful to you,\nI’ll be your slave, I’ll work for you. We’ll go to the young lady and\nbow down to her together, so that she may forgive us, and then we’ll go\naway. And if she won’t forgive us, we’ll go, anyway. Take her her money\nand love me.... Don’t love her.... Don’t love her any more. If you love\nher, I shall strangle her.... I’ll put out both her eyes with a\nneedle....”\n\n“I love you. I love only you. I’ll love you in Siberia....”\n\n“Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don’t care ... we’ll\nwork ... there’s snow in Siberia.... I love driving in the snow ... and\nmust have bells.... Do you hear, there’s a bell ringing? Where is that\nbell ringing? There are people coming.... Now it’s stopped.”\n\nShe closed her eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an\ninstant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance,\nbut the ringing had ceased. Mitya let his head sink on her breast. He\ndid not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he notice that\nthe songs had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor\nthere was absolute stillness in the house. Grushenka opened her eyes.\n\n“What’s the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ... I’ve been asleep\nand dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was\nwith some one I loved, with you. And far, far away. I was holding you\nand kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow\nglistened.... You know how the snow glistens at night when the moon\nshines. It was as though I was not on earth. I woke up, and my dear one\nis close to me. How sweet that is!...”\n\n“Close to you,” murmured Mitya, kissing her dress, her bosom, her\nhands. And suddenly he had a strange fancy: it seemed to him that she\nwas looking straight before her, not at him, not into his face, but\nover his head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity. An expression of\nwonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her face.\n\n“Mitya, who is that looking at us?” she whispered.",
            "12": "Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains\nand seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.\n\nHe jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder.\n\n“Here, come to us, come here,” said a voice, speaking not loudly, but\nfirmly and peremptorily.\n\nMitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still.\nThe room was filled with people, but not those who had been there\nbefore. An instantaneous shiver ran down his back, and he shuddered. He\nrecognized all those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the\novercoat and forage‐cap with a cockade—was the police captain, Mihail\nMakarovitch. And that “consumptive‐looking” trim dandy, “who always has\nsuch polished boots”—that was the deputy prosecutor. “He has a\nchronometer worth four hundred roubles; he showed it to me.” And that\nsmall young man in spectacles.... Mitya forgot his surname though he\nknew him, had seen him: he was the “investigating lawyer,” from the\n“school of jurisprudence,” who had only lately come to the town. And\nthis man—the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he knew\nwell. And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they here?\nAnd those other two ... peasants.... And there at the door Kalganov\nwith Trifon Borissovitch....\n\n“Gentlemen! What’s this for, gentlemen?” began Mitya, but suddenly, as\nthough beside himself, not knowing what he was doing, he cried aloud,\nat the top of his voice:\n\n“I un—der—stand!”\n\nThe young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up to\nMitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly:\n\n“We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to\nthe sofa.... It is absolutely imperative that you should give an\nexplanation.”\n\n“The old man!” cried Mitya frantically. “The old man and his blood!...\nI understand.”\n\nAnd he sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he had been\nmown down by a scythe.\n\n“You understand? He understands it! Monster and parricide! Your\nfather’s blood cries out against you!” the old captain of police roared\nsuddenly, stepping up to Mitya.\n\nHe was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over.\n\n“This is impossible!” cried the small young man. “Mihail Makarovitch,\nMihail Makarovitch, this won’t do!... I beg you’ll allow me to speak. I\nshould never have expected such behavior from you....”",
            "13": "“This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,” cried the captain of\npolice; “look at him: drunk, at this time of night, in the company of a\ndisreputable woman, with the blood of his father on his hands.... It’s\ndelirium!...”\n\n“I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your\nfeelings,” the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police\ncaptain, “or I shall be forced to resort to—”\n\nBut the little lawyer did not allow him to finish. He turned to Mitya,\nand delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:\n\n“Ex‐Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are\ncharged with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov,\nperpetrated this night....”\n\nHe said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, but\nthough Mitya heard them he did not understand them. He stared at them\nall with wild eyes.\n\n\n\n\nBook IX. The Preliminary Investigation"

        "content": {
            "0": "Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked\ngates of the widow Morozov’s house, ended, of course, by making himself\nheard. Fenya, who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours\nbefore, and too much “upset” to go to bed, was almost frightened into\nhysterics on hearing the furious knocking at the gate. Though she had\nherself seen him drive away, she fancied that it must be Dmitri\nFyodorovitch knocking again, no one else could knock so savagely. She\nran to the house‐porter, who had already waked up and gone out to the\ngate, and began imploring him not to open it. But having questioned\nPyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very\n“important business,” the man made up his mind at last to open. Pyotr\nIlyitch was admitted into Fenya’s kitchen, but the girl begged him to\nallow the house‐porter to be present, “because of her misgivings.” He\nbegan questioning her and at once learnt the most vital fact, that is,\nthat when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for Grushenka, he had\nsnatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he returned, the\npestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with blood.\n\n“And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him, dripping!” Fenya\nkept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of her\ndisordered imagination. But although not “dripping,” Pyotr Ilyitch had\nhimself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash\nthem. Moreover, the question he had to decide was not how soon the\nblood had dried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle,\nor rather, whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, and how he\ncould satisfactorily ascertain. Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to\nthis point, and though he found out nothing conclusive, yet he carried\naway a conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but\nto his father’s house, and that therefore something must have happened\nthere.",
            "1": "“And when he came back,” Fenya added with excitement, “I told him the\nwhole story, and then I began asking him, ‘Why have you got blood on\nyour hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?’ and he answered that that was human\nblood, and that he had just killed some one. He confessed it all to me,\nand suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking,\nwhere’s he run off to now like a madman? He’ll go to Mokroe, I thought,\nand kill my mistress there. I ran out to beg him not to kill her. I was\nrunning to his lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov’s shop, and saw him\njust setting off, and there was no blood on his hands then.” (Fenya had\nnoticed this and remembered it.) Fenya’s old grandmother confirmed her\nevidence as far as she was capable. After asking some further\nquestions, Pyotr Ilyitch left the house, even more upset and uneasy\nthan he had been when he entered it.\n\nThe most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to\ngo straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s, to find out whether anything had\nhappened there, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain,\nas Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he had satisfied himself\nof the fact. But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s gates were\nstrong, and he would have to knock again. His acquaintance with Fyodor\nPavlovitch was of the slightest, and what if, after he had been\nknocking, they opened to him, and nothing had happened? Then Fyodor\nPavlovitch in his jeering way would go telling the story all over the\ntown, how a stranger, called Perhotin, had broken in upon him at\nmidnight to ask if any one had killed him. It would make a scandal. And\nscandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world.\n\nYet the feeling that possessed him was so strong, that though he\nstamped his foot angrily and swore at himself, he set off again, not to\nFyodor Pavlovitch’s but to Madame Hohlakov’s. He decided that if she\ndenied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he\nwould go straight to the police captain, but if she admitted having\ngiven him the money, he would go home and let the matter rest till next\nmorning.",
            "2": "It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood\nof causing scandal by going at eleven o’clock at night to a fashionable\nlady, a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask\nher an amazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch. But that\nis just how it is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one,\nwith the decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people. Pyotr\nIlyitch was by no means phlegmatic at that moment. He remembered all\nhis life how a haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him,\ngrowing more and more painful and driving him on, against his will. Yet\nhe kept cursing himself, of course, all the way for going to this lady,\nbut “I will get to the bottom of it, I will!” he repeated for the tenth\ntime, grinding his teeth, and he carried out his intention.\n\nIt was exactly eleven o’clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov’s house.\nHe was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his\ninquiry whether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer,\nexcept that she was usually in bed by that time.\n\n“Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, she’ll\nreceive you. If she won’t, she won’t.”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The\nfootman was unwilling to take in his name, but finally called a maid.\nPyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady\nthat an official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on\nparticular business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance\nhe would not have ventured to come. “Tell her in those words, in those\nwords exactly,” he asked the girl.\n\nShe went away. He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov\nherself was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt\nupset ever since Mitya’s visit, and had a presentiment that she would\nnot get through the night without the sick headache which always, with\nher, followed such excitement. She was surprised on hearing the\nannouncement from the maid. She irritably declined to see him, however,\nthough the unexpected visit at such an hour, of an “official living in\nthe town,” who was a total stranger, roused her feminine curiosity\nintensely. But this time Pyotr Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He\nbegged the maid most earnestly to take another message in these very\nwords:",
            "3": "“That he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that\nMadame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to\nsee him now.”\n\n“I plunged headlong,” he described it afterwards.\n\nThe maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again.\nMadame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he\nlooked like, and learned that he was “very well dressed, young and so\npolite.” We may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather\ngood‐looking young man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov\nmade up her mind to see him. She was in her dressing‐gown and slippers,\nbut she flung a black shawl over her shoulders. “The official” was\nasked to walk into the drawing‐room, the very room in which Mitya had\nbeen received shortly before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a\nsternly inquiring countenance, and, without asking him to sit down,\nbegan at once with the question:\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our\ncommon acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,” Perhotin began.\n\nBut he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady’s face showed signs\nof acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a\nfury:\n\n“How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?” she cried\nhysterically. “How dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a\nlady who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And\nto force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this very\ndrawing‐room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out\nof the room, as no one would go out of a decent house. Let me tell you,\nsir, that I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it\npass. Kindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I—”\n\n“Murder! then he tried to murder you, too?”\n\n“Why, has he killed somebody else?” Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively.",
            "4": "“If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I’ll explain it\nall in a couple of words,” answered Perhotin, firmly. “At five o’clock\nthis afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I\nknow for a fact he had no money. Yet at nine o’clock, he came to see me\nwith a bundle of hundred‐rouble notes in his hand, about two or three\nthousand roubles. His hands and face were all covered with blood, and\nhe looked like a madman. When I asked him where he had got so much\nmoney, he answered that he had just received it from you, that you had\ngiven him a sum of three thousand to go to the gold‐mines....”\n\nMadame Hohlakov’s face assumed an expression of intense and painful\nexcitement.\n\n“Good God! He must have killed his old father!” she cried, clasping her\nhands. “I have never given him money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don’t say\nanother word! Save the old man ... run to his father ... run!”\n\n“Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him money? You remember for a\nfact that you did not give him any money?”\n\n“No, I didn’t, I didn’t! I refused to give it him, for he could not\nappreciate it. He ran out in a fury, stamping. He rushed at me, but I\nslipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from\nyou now, that he positively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are\nwe standing? Ah, sit down.”\n\n“Excuse me, I....”\n\n“Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an\nawful death!”\n\n“But if he has killed him already?”\n\n“Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think\nwe must do now?”\n\nMeantime she had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself,\nfacing him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her the\nhistory of the affair, that part of it at least which he had himself\nwitnessed. He described, too, his visit to Fenya, and told her about\nthe pestle. All these details produced an overwhelming effect on the\ndistracted lady, who kept uttering shrieks, and covering her face with\nher hands....",
            "5": "“Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty,\nwhatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I’ve looked at that\nawful man and always thought, that man will end by murdering me. And\nnow it’s happened ... that is, if he hasn’t murdered me, but only his\nown father, it’s only because the finger of God preserved me, and\nwhat’s more, he was ashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I\nput the holy ikon from the relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on\nhis neck.... And to think how near I was to death at that minute, I\nwent close up to him and he stretched out his neck to me!... Do you\nknow, Pyotr Ilyitch (I think you said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch), I\ndon’t believe in miracles, but that ikon and this unmistakable miracle\nwith me now—that shakes me, and I’m ready to believe in anything you\nlike. Have you heard about Father Zossima?... But I don’t know what I’m\nsaying ... and only fancy, with the ikon on his neck he spat at me....\nHe only spat, it’s true, he didn’t murder me and ... he dashed away!\nBut what shall we do, what must we do now? What do you think?”\n\nPyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he was going straight to the\npolice captain, to tell him all about it, and leave him to do what he\nthought fit.\n\n“Oh, he’s an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarovitch, I know him.\nOf course, he’s the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr\nIlyitch! How well you’ve thought of everything! I should never have\nthought of it in your place!”\n\n“Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,” observed\nPyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious\nto escape as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not\nlet him say good‐by and go away.\n\n“And be sure, be sure,” she prattled on, “to come back and tell me what\nyou see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... how\nthey’ll try him ... and what he’s condemned to.... Tell me, we have no\ncapital punishment, have we? But be sure to come, even if it’s at three\no’clock at night, at four, at half‐past four.... Tell them to wake me,\nto wake me, to shake me, if I don’t get up.... But, good heavens, I\nshan’t sleep! But wait, hadn’t I better come with you?”\n\n“N—no. But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating\nthat you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be\nof use ... in case it’s needed....”",
            "6": "“To be sure!” Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her bureau. “And\nyou know I’m simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good\nsense in such affairs. Are you in the service here? I’m delighted to\nthink that you’re in the service here!”\n\nAnd still speaking, she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the\nfollowing lines:\n\nI’ve never in my life lent to that unhappy man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch\nKaramazov (for, in spite of all, he is unhappy), three thousand roubles\nto‐day. I’ve never given him money, never: That I swear by all that’s\nholy!\n\n\nK. HOHLAKOV.\n\n\n“Here’s the note!” she turned quickly to Pyotr Ilyitch. “Go, save him.\nIt’s a noble deed on your part!”\n\nAnd she made the sign of the cross three times over him. She ran out to\naccompany him to the passage.\n\n“How grateful I am to you! You can’t think how grateful I am to you for\nhaving come to me, first. How is it I haven’t met you before? I shall\nfeel flattered at seeing you at my house in the future. How delightful\nit is that you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical\nability!... They must appreciate you, they must understand you. If\nthere’s anything I can do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! I’m\nin love with young people! The younger generation are the one prop of\nour suffering country. Her one hope.... Oh, go, go!...”\n\nBut Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she would not have let him go\nso soon. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on\nhim, which had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such\nan unpleasant affair. Tastes differ, as we all know. “She’s by no means\nso elderly,” he thought, feeling pleased, “on the contrary I should\nhave taken her for her daughter.”\n\nAs for Madame Hohlakov, she was simply enchanted by the young man.\n“Such sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all\nthat with such manners and appearance! People say the young people of\nto‐day are no good for anything, but here’s an example!” etc. So she\nsimply forgot this “dreadful affair,” and it was only as she was\ngetting into bed, that, suddenly recalling “how near death she had\nbeen,” she exclaimed: “Ah, it is awful, awful!”\n\nBut she fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep.",
            "7": "I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant\ndetails, if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no\nmeans elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the\nfoundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young man.\nHis story is remembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I\nshall perhaps have something to say about it, when I have finished my\nlong history of the Brothers Karamazov."

            "0": "Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired lieutenant‐\ncolonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had only come to us\nthree years previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly because he\n“knew how to keep society together.” He was never without visitors, and\ncould not have got on without them. Some one or other was always dining\nwith him; he never sat down to table without guests. He gave regular\ndinners, too, on all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising\nones. Though the fare was not _recherché_, it was abundant. The\nfish‐pies were excellent, and the wine made up in quantity for what it\nlacked in quality.\n\nThe first room his guests entered was a well‐fitted billiard‐room, with\npictures of English race‐horses, in black frames on the walls, an\nessential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor’s billiard‐room.\nThere was card‐playing every evening at his house, if only at one\ntable. But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the\nmammas and young ladies, assembled at his house to dance. Though Mihail\nMakarovitch was a widower, he did not live alone. His widowed daughter\nlived with him, with her two unmarried daughters, grown‐up girls, who\nhad finished their education. They were of agreeable appearance and\nlively character, and though every one knew they would have no dowry,\nthey attracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfather’s\nhouse.\n\nMihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work, though\nhe performed his duties no worse than many others. To speak plainly, he\nwas a man of rather narrow education. His understanding of the limits\nof his administrative power could not always be relied upon. It was not\nso much that he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the\npresent reign, as that he made conspicuous blunders in his\ninterpretation of them. This was not from any special lack of\nintelligence, but from carelessness, for he was always in too great a\nhurry to go into the subject.",
            "1": "“I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,” he used to\nsay of himself. He had not even formed a definite idea of the\nfundamental principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation\nof the serfs, and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year,\ninvoluntarily increasing his knowledge by practice. And yet he was\nhimself a landowner. Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he would meet\nsome of Mihail Makarovitch’s visitors there that evening, but he didn’t\nknow which. As it happened, at that moment the prosecutor, and\nVarvinsky, our district doctor, a young man, who had only just come to\nus from Petersburg after taking a brilliant degree at the Academy of\nMedicine, were playing whist at the police captain’s. Ippolit\nKirillovitch, the prosecutor (he was really the deputy prosecutor, but\nwe always called him the prosecutor), was rather a peculiar man, of\nabout five and thirty, inclined to be consumptive, and married to a fat\nand childless woman. He was vain and irritable, though he had a good\nintellect, and even a kind heart. It seemed that all that was wrong\nwith him was that he had a better opinion of himself than his ability\nwarranted. And that made him seem constantly uneasy. He had, moreover,\ncertain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards psychology, for\ninstance, a special study of the human heart, a special knowledge of\nthe criminal and his crime. He cherished a grievance on this ground,\nconsidering that he had been passed over in the service, and being\nfirmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properly\nappreciated, and had enemies. In gloomy moments he even threatened to\ngive up his post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The\nunexpected Karamazov case agitated him profoundly: “It was a case that\nmight well be talked about all over Russia.” But I am anticipating.\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who had\nonly come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next\nroom with the young ladies. People talked about it afterwards and\nwondered that all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the\nevening of “the crime” have been gathered together at the house of the\nexecutive authority. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite\nnaturally.",
            "2": "Ippolit Kirillovitch’s wife had had toothache for the last two days,\nand he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans. The doctor,\nfrom the very nature of his being, could not spend an evening except at\ncards. Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days\npast to drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch’s, so to speak\ncasually, so as slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga\nMihailovna, by showing that he knew her secret, that he knew it was her\nbirthday, and that she was trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not\nto be obliged to give a dance. He anticipated a great deal of\nmerriment, many playful jests about her age, and her being afraid to\nreveal it, about his knowing her secret and telling everybody, and so\non. The charming young man was a great adept at such teasing; the\nladies had christened him “the naughty man,” and he seemed to be\ndelighted at the name. He was extremely well‐bred, however, of good\nfamily, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of pleasure,\nhis sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He was short, and\ndelicate‐looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he always wore\na number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his official\nduties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though realizing his\nposition and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him. He had a\nspecial gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the\npeasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their\nrespect, he certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.\n\nPyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police\ncaptain’s. He saw instantly that every one knew. They had positively\nthrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even Nikolay\nParfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous\nand ready for action. Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news\nthat old Fyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his\nown house, murdered and robbed. The news had only just reached them in\nthe following manner.",
            "3": "Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked\nsenseless near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her bed and might\nwell have slept till morning after the draught she had taken. But, all\nof a sudden she waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream\nfrom Smerdyakov, who was lying in the next room unconscious. That\nscream always preceded his fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa\nIgnatyevna. She could never get accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran\nhalf‐awake to Smerdyakov’s room. But it was dark there, and she could\nonly hear the invalid beginning to gasp and struggle. Then Marfa\nIgnatyevna herself screamed out and was going to call her husband, but\nsuddenly realized that when she had got up, he was not beside her in\nbed. She ran back to the bedstead and began groping with her hands, but\nthe bed was really empty. Then he must have gone out—where? She ran to\nthe steps and timidly called him. She got no answer, of course, but she\ncaught the sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness. She\nlistened. The groans were repeated, and it was evident they came from\nthe garden.\n\n“Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya!” she thought\ndistractedly. She went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate\ninto the garden was open.\n\n“He must be out there, poor dear,” she thought. She went up to the gate\nand all at once she distinctly heard Grigory calling her by name,\n“Marfa! Marfa!” in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice.\n\n“Lord, preserve us from harm!” Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran\ntowards the voice, and that was how she found Grigory. But she found\nhim not by the fence where he had been knocked down, but about twenty\npaces off. It appeared later, that he had crawled away on coming to\nhimself, and probably had been a long time getting so far, losing\nconsciousness several times. She noticed at once that he was covered\nwith blood, and screamed at the top of her voice. Grigory was muttering\nincoherently:\n\n“He has murdered ... his father murdered.... Why scream, silly ... run\n... fetch some one....”",
            "4": "But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her master’s window was\nopen and that there was a candle alight in the window, she ran there\nand began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But peeping in at the window, she\nsaw a fearful sight. Her master was lying on his back, motionless, on\nthe floor. His light‐colored dressing‐gown and white shirt were soaked\nwith blood. The candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and\nthe motionless dead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch. Terror‐stricken, Marfa\nrushed away from the window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of\nthe big gate and ran headlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya\nKondratyevna. Both mother and daughter were asleep, but they waked up\nat Marfa’s desperate and persistent screaming and knocking at the\nshutter. Marfa, shrieking and screaming incoherently, managed to tell\nthem the main fact, and to beg for assistance. It happened that Foma\nhad come back from his wanderings and was staying the night with them.\nThey got him up immediately and all three ran to the scene of the\ncrime. On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered that at about eight\no’clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden, and this was no\ndoubt Grigory’s scream, “Parricide!” uttered when he caught hold of\nMitya’s leg.\n\n“Some one person screamed out and then was silent,” Marya Kondratyevna\nexplained as she ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the two\nwomen with the help of Foma carried him to the lodge. They lighted a\ncandle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he was writhing in\nconvulsions, his eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing from\nhis lips. They moistened Grigory’s forehead with water mixed with\nvinegar, and the water revived him at once. He asked immediately:\n\n“Is the master murdered?”",
            "5": "Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that\nnot only the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open,\nthough Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every\nnight and did not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext. Seeing\nthat door open, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch “for\nfear anything should happen afterwards.” And when they returned to\nGrigory, the old man told them to go straight to the police captain.\nMarya Kondratyevna ran there and gave the alarm to the whole party at\nthe police captain’s. She arrived only five minutes before Pyotr\nIlyitch, so that his story came, not as his own surmise and theory, but\nas the direct confirmation, by a witness, of the theory held by all, as\nto the identity of the criminal (a theory he had in the bottom of his\nheart refused to believe till that moment).\n\nIt was resolved to act with energy. The deputy police inspector of the\ntown was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor\nPavlovitch’s house and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according\nto the regular forms, which I will not go into here. The district\ndoctor, a zealous man, new to his work, almost insisted on accompanying\nthe police captain, the prosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.\n\nI will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead,\nwith his skull battered in. But with what? Most likely with the same\nweapon with which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that\nweapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was\nat once given, described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been\nknocked down. They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found\nthe brass pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden\npath. There were no signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor\nPavlovitch was lying. But by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up\nfrom the floor a big and thick envelope with the inscription: “A\npresent of three thousand roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she is\nwilling to come.” And below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, “For\nmy little chicken.” There were three seals of red sealing‐wax on the\nenvelope, but it had been torn open and was empty: the money had been\nremoved. They found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon,\nwith which the envelope had been tied up.",
            "6": "One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch’s evidence made a great impression on the\nprosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his idea that\nDmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had\nresolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols,\nloaded them before him, written a letter, put it in his pocket, etc.\nWhen Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened\nto tell some one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered\ngrinning: “You’ll be too late.” So they must make haste to Mokroe to\nfind the criminal, before he really did shoot himself.\n\n“That’s clear, that’s clear!” repeated the prosecutor in great\nexcitement. “That’s just the way with mad fellows like that: ‘I shall\nkill myself to‐ morrow, so I’ll make merry till I die!’ ”\n\nThe story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the\nprosecutor more than ever.\n\n“Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev,\ngentlemen? He stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his hair\ncurled, and then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in\nhis hand in the same way, he went off to the girls.”",
            "7": "All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the\nformalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. It all took time\nand so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the\nofficer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had\narrived in the town the morning before to get his pay. He was\ninstructed to avoid raising the alarm when he reached Mokroe, but to\nkeep constant watch over the “criminal” till the arrival of the proper\nauthorities, to procure also witnesses for the arrest, police\nconstables, and so on. Mavriky Mavrikyevitch did as he was told,\npreserving his incognito, and giving no one but his old acquaintance,\nTrifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of his secret business. He had\nspoken to him just before Mitya met the landlord in the balcony,\nlooking for him in the dark, and noticed at once a change in Trifon\nBorissovitch’s face and voice. So neither Mitya nor any one else knew\nthat he was being watched. The box with the pistols had been carried\noff by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place. Only after four\no’clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain, the\nprosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each\ndrawn by three horses. The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s to\nmake a post‐mortem next day on the body. But he was particularly\ninterested in the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.\n\n“Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for\ntwenty‐four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to\nscience,” he declared enthusiastically to his companions, and as they\nleft they laughingly congratulated him on his find. The prosecutor and\nthe investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor’s saying that\nSmerdyakov could not outlive the night.\n\nAfter these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to\nthat moment of our tale at which we broke off."

            "0": "And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him, not\nunderstanding what was said to him. Suddenly he got up, flung up his\nhands, and shouted aloud:\n\n“I’m not guilty! I’m not guilty of that blood! I’m not guilty of my\nfather’s blood.... I meant to kill him. But I’m not guilty. Not I.”\n\nBut he had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind the\ncurtain and flung herself at the police captain’s feet.\n\n“It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness!” she cried, in a heartrending\nvoice, bathed in tears, stretching out her clasped hands towards them.\n“He did it through me. I tortured him and drove him to it. I tortured\nthat poor old man that’s dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him\nto this! It’s my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!”\n\n“Yes, it’s your fault! You’re the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!\nYou’re the most to blame!” shouted the police captain, threatening her\nwith his hand. But he was quickly and resolutely suppressed. The\nprosecutor positively seized hold of him.\n\n“This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch!” he cried. “You are\npositively hindering the inquiry.... You’re ruining the case....” he\nalmost gasped.\n\n“Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course!” cried Nikolay\nParfenovitch, fearfully excited too, “otherwise it’s absolutely\nimpossible!...”\n\n“Judge us together!” Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling.\n“Punish us together. I will go with him now, if it’s to death!”\n\n“Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!” Mitya fell on his knees\nbeside her and held her tight in his arms. “Don’t believe her,” he\ncried, “she’s not guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!”\n\nHe remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her by\nseveral men, and that she was led out, and that when he recovered\nhimself he was sitting at the table. Beside him and behind him stood\nthe men with metal plates. Facing him on the other side of the table\nsat Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He kept persuading\nhim to drink a little water out of a glass that stood on the table.",
            "1": "“That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don’t be\nfrightened,” he added, extremely politely. Mitya (he remembered it\nafterwards) became suddenly intensely interested in his big rings, one\nwith an amethyst, and another with a transparent bright yellow stone,\nof great brilliance. And long afterwards he remembered with wonder how\nthose rings had riveted his attention through all those terrible hours\nof interrogation, so that he was utterly unable to tear himself away\nfrom them and dismiss them, as things that had nothing to do with his\nposition. On Mitya’s left side, in the place where Maximov had been\nsitting at the beginning of the evening, the prosecutor was now seated,\nand on Mitya’s right hand, where Grushenka had been, was a rosy‐cheeked\nyoung man in a sort of shabby hunting‐jacket, with ink and paper before\nhim. This was the secretary of the investigating lawyer, who had\nbrought him with him. The police captain was now standing by the window\nat the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was sitting there.\n\n“Drink some water,” said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenth\ntime.\n\n“I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush\nme, punish me, decide my fate!” cried Mitya, staring with terribly\nfixed wide‐ open eyes at the investigating lawyer.\n\n“So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your\nfather, Fyodor Pavlovitch?” asked the investigating lawyer, softly but\ninsistently.\n\n“I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not\nof my father’s. And I weep for it! I killed, I killed the old man and\nknocked him down.... But it’s hard to have to answer for that murder\nwith another, a terrible murder of which I am not guilty.... It’s a\nterrible accusation, gentlemen, a knock‐down blow. But who has killed\nmy father, who has killed him? Who can have killed him if I didn’t?\nIt’s marvelous, extraordinary, impossible.”\n\n“Yes, who can have killed him?” the investigating lawyer was beginning,\nbut Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him, addressed\nMitya.\n\n“You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory\nVassilyevitch. He is alive, he has recovered, and in spite of the\nterrible blows inflicted, according to his own and your evidence, by\nyou, there seems no doubt that he will live, so the doctor says, at\nleast.”",
            "2": "“Alive? He’s alive?” cried Mitya, flinging up his hands. His face\nbeamed. “Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a\nsinner and evildoer. That’s an answer to my prayer. I’ve been praying\nall night.” And he crossed himself three times. He was almost\nbreathless.\n\n“So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence\nconcerning you, that—” The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya\nsuddenly jumped up from his chair.\n\n“One minute, gentlemen, for God’s sake, one minute; I will run to her—”\n\n“Excuse me, at this moment it’s quite impossible,” Nikolay Parfenovitch\nalmost shrieked. He, too, leapt to his feet. Mitya was seized by the\nmen with the metal plates, but he sat down of his own accord....\n\n“Gentlemen, what a pity! I wanted to see her for one minute only; I\nwanted to tell her that it has been washed away, it has gone, that\nblood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a\nmurderer now! Gentlemen, she is my betrothed!” he said ecstatically and\nreverently, looking round at them all. “Oh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh,\nin one minute you have given me new life, new heart!... That old man\nused to carry me in his arms, gentlemen. He used to wash me in the tub\nwhen I was a baby three years old, abandoned by every one, he was like\na father to me!...”\n\n“And so you—” the investigating lawyer began.\n\n“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,” interposed Mitya,\nputting his elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands.\n“Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is\nhorribly upsetting, horribly. A man is not a drum, gentlemen!”\n\n“Drink a little more water,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.",
            "3": "Mitya took his hands from his face and laughed. His eyes were\nconfident. He seemed completely transformed in a moment. His whole\nbearing was changed; he was once more the equal of these men, with all\nof whom he was acquainted, as though they had all met the day before,\nwhen nothing had happened, at some social gathering. We may note in\npassing that, on his first arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at\nthe police captain’s, but later, during the last month especially,\nMitya had hardly called at all, and when the police captain met him, in\nthe street, for instance, Mitya noticed that he frowned and only bowed\nout of politeness. His acquaintance with the prosecutor was less\nintimate, though he sometimes paid his wife, a nervous and fanciful\nlady, visits of politeness, without quite knowing why, and she always\nreceived him graciously and had, for some reason, taken an interest in\nhim up to the last. He had not had time to get to know the\ninvestigating lawyer, though he had met him and talked to him twice,\neach time about the fair sex.\n\n“You’re a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,” cried\nMitya, laughing gayly, “but I can help you now. Oh, gentlemen, I feel\nlike a new man, and don’t be offended at my addressing you so simply\nand directly. I’m rather drunk, too, I’ll tell you that frankly. I\nbelieve I’ve had the honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay\nParfenovitch, at my kinsman Miüsov’s. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don’t\npretend to be on equal terms with you. I understand, of course, in what\ncharacter I am sitting before you. Oh, of course, there’s a horrible\nsuspicion ... hanging over me ... if Grigory has given evidence.... A\nhorrible suspicion! It’s awful, awful, I understand that! But to\nbusiness, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will make an end of it in one\nmoment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen! Since I know I’m innocent, we\ncan put an end to it in a minute. Can’t we? Can’t we?”\n\nMitya spoke much and quickly, nervously and effusively, as though he\npositively took his listeners to be his best friends.\n\n“So, for the present, we will write that you absolutely deny the charge\nbrought against you,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, impressively, and\nbending down to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what\nto write.",
            "4": "“Write it down? You want to write that down? Well, write it; I consent,\nI give my full consent, gentlemen, only ... do you see?... Stay, stay,\nwrite this. Of disorderly conduct I am guilty, of violence on a poor\nold man I am guilty. And there is something else at the bottom of my\nheart, of which I am guilty, too—but that you need not write down” (he\nturned suddenly to the secretary); “that’s my personal life, gentlemen,\nthat doesn’t concern you, the bottom of my heart, that’s to say.... But\nof the murder of my old father I’m not guilty. That’s a wild idea. It’s\nquite a wild idea!... I will prove you that and you’ll be convinced\ndirectly.... You will laugh, gentlemen. You’ll laugh yourselves at your\nsuspicion!...”\n\n“Be calm, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” said the investigating lawyer evidently\ntrying to allay Mitya’s excitement by his own composure. “Before we go\non with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to\nhear you confirm the statement that you disliked your father, Fyodor\nPavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him. Here\nat least, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to\nkill him: ‘I didn’t kill him,’ you said, ‘but I wanted to kill him.’ ”\n\n“Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I\ndid want to kill him ... many times I wanted to ... unhappily,\nunhappily!”\n\n“You wanted to. Would you consent to explain what motives precisely led\nyou to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent?”",
            "5": "“What is there to explain, gentlemen?” Mitya shrugged his shoulders\nsullenly, looking down. “I have never concealed my feelings. All the\ntown knows about it—every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I\ndeclared them in Father Zossima’s cell.... And the very same day, in\nthe evening I beat my father. I nearly killed him, and I swore I’d come\nagain and kill him, before witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! I’ve\nbeen shouting it aloud for the last month, any one can tell you\nthat!... The fact stares you in the face, it speaks for itself, it\ncries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen, feelings are another matter. You\nsee, gentlemen”—Mitya frowned—“it seems to me that about feelings\nyou’ve no right to question me. I know that you are bound by your\noffice, I quite understand that, but that’s my affair, my private,\nintimate affair, yet ... since I haven’t concealed my feelings in the\npast ... in the tavern, for instance, I’ve talked to every one, so ...\nso I won’t make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen,\nthat there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every\none that I’d kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he’s been killed. So\nit must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen,\nI can quite make allowances. I’m struck all of a heap myself, for who\ncan have murdered him, if not I? That’s what it comes to, isn’t it? If\nnot I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on\nknowing!” he exclaimed suddenly. “Where was he murdered? How was he\nmurdered? How, and with what? Tell me,” he asked quickly, looking at\nthe two lawyers.\n\n“We found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his\nhead battered in,” said the prosecutor.\n\n“That’s horrible!” Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the\ntable, hid his face in his right hand.\n\n“We will continue,” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. “So what was it\nthat impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in\npublic, I believe, that it was based upon jealousy?”\n\n“Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.”\n\n“Disputes about money?”\n\n“Yes, about money, too.”\n\n“There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which you\nclaimed as part of your inheritance?”",
            "6": "“Three thousand! More, more,” cried Mitya hotly; “more than six\nthousand, more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at\nthem. But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was\ndesperately in need of that three thousand ... so the bundle of notes\nfor three thousand that I knew he kept under his pillow, ready for\nGrushenka, I considered as simply stolen from me. Yes, gentlemen, I\nlooked upon it as mine, as my own property....”\n\nThe prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and\nhad time to wink at him on the sly.\n\n“We will return to that subject later,” said the lawyer promptly. “You\nwill allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked\nupon that money as your own property?”\n\n“Write it down, by all means. I know that’s another fact that tells\nagainst me, but I’m not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself.\nDo you hear? Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort\nof man from what I am,” he added, suddenly gloomy and dejected. “You\nhave to deal with a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above\nall—don’t lose sight of it—a man who’s done a lot of nasty things, but\nhas always been, and still is, honorable at bottom, in his inner being.\nI don’t know how to express it. That’s just what’s made me wretched all\nmy life, that I yearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a\nmartyr to a sense of honor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the\nlantern of Diogenes, and yet all my life I’ve been doing filthy things\nlike all of us, gentlemen ... that is like me alone. That was a\nmistake, like me alone, me alone!... Gentlemen, my head aches ...” His\nbrows contracted with pain. “You see, gentlemen, I couldn’t bear the\nlook of him, there was something in him ignoble, impudent, trampling on\neverything sacred, something sneering and irreverent, loathsome,\nloathsome. But now that he’s dead, I feel differently.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“I don’t feel differently, but I wish I hadn’t hated him so.”\n\n“You feel penitent?”\n\n“No, not penitent, don’t write that. I’m not much good myself, I’m not\nvery beautiful, so I had no right to consider him repulsive. That’s\nwhat I mean. Write that down, if you like.”\n\nSaying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more\ngloomy as the inquiry continued.",
            "7": "At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka had\nbeen removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next\nbut one from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It\nwas a little room with one window, next beyond the large room in which\nthey had danced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no\none by her but Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared,\nand clung to her side, as though for security. At their door stood one\nof the peasants with a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying,\nand suddenly her grief was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up\nher arms and, with a loud wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to\nhim, to her Mitya, and so unexpectedly that they had not time to stop\nher. Mitya, hearing her cry, trembled, jumped up, and with a yell\nrushed impetuously to meet her, not knowing what he was doing. But they\nwere not allowed to come together, though they saw one another. He was\nseized by the arms. He struggled, and tried to tear himself away. It\ntook three or four men to hold him. She was seized too, and he saw her\nstretching out her arms to him, crying aloud as they carried her away.\nWhen the scene was over, he came to himself again, sitting in the same\nplace as before, opposite the investigating lawyer, and crying out to\nthem:\n\n“What do you want with her? Why do you torment her? She’s done nothing,\nnothing!...”\n\nThe lawyers tried to soothe him. About ten minutes passed like this. At\nlast Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into the\nroom, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor:\n\n“She’s been removed, she’s downstairs. Will you allow me to say one\nword to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in\nyour presence.”\n\n“By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,” answered the investigating lawyer.\n“In the present case we have nothing against it.”",
            "8": "“Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,” began the police\ncaptain, and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the\nluckless prisoner on his excited face. “I took your Agrafena\nAlexandrovna downstairs myself, and confided her to the care of the\nlandlord’s daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her all the\ntime. And I soothed her, do you hear? I soothed and calmed her. I\nimpressed on her that you have to clear yourself, so she mustn’t hinder\nyou, must not depress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong\nthing in your evidence. In fact, I talked to her and she understood.\nShe’s a sensible girl, my boy, a good‐hearted girl, she would have\nkissed my old hands, begging help for you. She sent me herself, to tell\nyou not to worry about her. And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go\nand tell her that you are calm and comforted about her. And so you must\nbe calm, do you understand? I was unfair to her; she is a Christian\nsoul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you, she’s a gentle soul, and not to blame\nfor anything. So what am I to tell her, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you\nsit quiet or not?”\n\nThe good‐natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular,\nbut Grushenka’s suffering, a fellow creature’s suffering, touched his\ngood‐ natured heart, and tears stood in his eyes. Mitya jumped up and\nrushed towards him.",
            "9": "“Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!” he cried. “You’ve the\nheart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her. I\nwill, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact. Tell her, in the kindness of\nyour heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be\nlaughing in a minute, knowing that she has a guardian angel like you. I\nshall have done with all this directly, and as soon as I’m free, I’ll\nbe with her, she’ll see, let her wait. Gentlemen,” he said, turning to\nthe two lawyers, “now I’ll open my whole soul to you; I’ll pour out\neverything. We’ll finish this off directly, finish it off gayly. We\nshall laugh at it in the end, shan’t we? But, gentlemen, that woman is\nthe queen of my heart. Oh, let me tell you that. That one thing I’ll\ntell you now.... I see I’m with honorable men. She is my light, she is\nmy holy one, and if only you knew! Did you hear her cry, ‘I’ll go to\ndeath with you’? And what have I, a penniless beggar, done for her? Why\nsuch love for me? How can a clumsy, ugly brute like me, with my ugly\nface, deserve such love, that she is ready to go to exile with me? And\nhow she fell down at your feet for my sake, just now!... and yet she’s\nproud and has done nothing! How can I help adoring her, how can I help\ncrying out and rushing to her as I did just now? Gentlemen, forgive me!\nBut now, now I am comforted.”\n\nAnd he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands,\nburst into tears. But they were happy tears. He recovered himself\ninstantly. The old police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers\nalso. They felt that the examination was passing into a new phase. When\nthe police captain went out, Mitya was positively gay.\n\n“Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal. And\nif it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand one\nanother in a minute. I’m at those details again. I’m at your disposal,\ngentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in me\nand I in you, or there’ll be no end to it. I speak in your interests.\nTo business, gentlemen, to business, and don’t rummage in my soul;\ndon’t tease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what\nmatters, and I will satisfy you at once. And damn the details!”\n\nSo spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again."

            "0": "“You don’t know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by your\nreadiness to answer,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air,\nand obvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent, short‐sighted,\nlight gray eyes, from which he had removed his spectacles a moment\nbefore. “And you have made a very just remark about the mutual\nconfidence, without which it is sometimes positively impossible to get\non in cases of such importance, if the suspected party really hopes and\ndesires to defend himself and is in a position to do so. We, on our\nside, will do everything in our power, and you can see for yourself how\nwe are conducting the case. You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?” He\nturned to the prosecutor.\n\n“Oh, undoubtedly,” replied the prosecutor. His tone was somewhat cold,\ncompared with Nikolay Parfenovitch’s impulsiveness.\n\nI will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but lately\narrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit\nKirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his bosom friend.\nHe was almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit\nKirillovitch’s extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and\nin the justice of his grievance. He had heard of him in Petersburg. On\nthe other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the\nwhole world whom our “unappreciated” prosecutor genuinely liked. On\ntheir way to Mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the\npresent case. And now as they sat at the table, the sharp‐witted junior\ncaught and interpreted every indication on his senior colleague’s\nface—half a word, a glance, or a wink.\n\n“Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don’t interrupt me with\ntrivial questions and I’ll tell you everything in a moment,” said Mitya\nexcitedly.\n\n“Excellent! Thank you. But before we proceed to listen to your\ncommunication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact\nof great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday\nat about five o’clock on the security of your pistols, from your\nfriend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.”\n\n“I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more?\nThat’s all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.”\n\n“You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?”\n\n“Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country. Didn’t you\nknow?”\n\nThe prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances.",
            "1": "“Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic\ndescription of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards? Allow\nus, for instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and\njust when you left and when you came back—all those facts.”\n\n“You should have asked me like that from the beginning,” cried Mitya,\nlaughing aloud, “and, if you like, we won’t begin from yesterday, but\nfrom the morning of the day before; then you’ll understand how, why,\nand where I went. I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a\nmerchant of the town, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles\nfrom him on safe security. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was\na sudden necessity.”\n\n“Allow me to interrupt you,” the prosecutor put in politely. “Why were\nyou in such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?”\n\n“Oh, gentlemen, you needn’t go into details, how, when and why, and why\njust so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole. Why, it’ll\nrun to three volumes, and then you’ll want an epilogue!”\n\nMitya said all this with the good‐natured but impatient familiarity of\na man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best\nintentions.",
            "2": "“Gentlemen!”—he corrected himself hurriedly—“don’t be vexed with me for\nmy restiveness, I beg you again. Believe me once more, I feel the\ngreatest respect for you and understand the true position of affairs.\nDon’t think I’m drunk. I’m quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk\nwould be no hindrance. It’s with me, you know, like the saying: ‘When\nhe is sober, he is a fool; when he is drunk, he is a wise man.’ Ha ha!\nBut I see, gentlemen, it’s not the proper thing to make jokes to you,\ntill we’ve had our explanation, I mean. And I’ve my own dignity to keep\nup, too. I quite understand the difference for the moment. I am, after\nall, in the position of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal\nterms with you. And it’s your business to watch me. I can’t expect you\nto pat me on the head for what I did to Grigory, for one can’t break\nold men’s heads with impunity. I suppose you’ll put me away for him for\nsix months, or a year perhaps, in a house of correction. I don’t know\nwhat the punishment is—but it will be without loss of the rights of my\nrank, without loss of my rank, won’t it? So you see, gentlemen, I\nunderstand the distinction between us.... But you must see that you\ncould puzzle God Himself with such questions. ‘How did you step? Where\ndid you step? When did you step? And on what did you step?’ I shall get\nmixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it all down against\nme. And what will that lead to? To nothing! And even if it’s nonsense\nI’m talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being men of honor\nand refinement, will forgive me! I’ll finish by asking you, gentlemen,\nto drop that conventional method of questioning. I mean, beginning from\nsome miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for breakfast, how I\nspat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention of the\ncriminal, suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question, ‘Whom did\nyou murder? Whom did you rob?’ Ha ha! That’s your regulation method,\nthat’s where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off their\nguard like that, but not me. I know the tricks. I’ve been in the\nservice, too. Ha ha ha! You’re not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my\nimpertinence?” he cried, looking at them with a good‐nature that was\nalmost surprising. “It’s only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can\noverlook it. It would be inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can\nforgive it in Mitya. Ha ha!”",
            "3": "Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. Though the prosecutor\ndid not laugh, he kept his eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though\nanxious not to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the\nsmallest twitch of any feature of his face.\n\n“That’s how we have treated you from the beginning,” said Nikolay\nParfenovitch, still laughing. “We haven’t tried to put you out by\nasking how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast. We\nbegan, indeed, with questions of the greatest importance.”\n\n“I understand. I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still more\nyour present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of your\nnoble hearts. We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on the\nfooting of mutual confidence between educated, well‐bred people, who\nhave the common bond of noble birth and honor. In any case, allow me to\nlook upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this\nmoment when my honor is assailed. That’s no offense to you, gentlemen,\nis it?”\n\n“On the contrary. You’ve expressed all that so well, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch,” Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified\napprobation.\n\n“And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those tricky\nquestions!” cried Mitya enthusiastically. “Or there’s simply no knowing\nwhere we shall get to! Is there?”\n\n“I will follow your sensible advice entirely,” the prosecutor\ninterposed, addressing Mitya. “I don’t withdraw my question, however.\nIt is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that\nsum, I mean precisely three thousand.”\n\n“Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to\npay a debt.”\n\n“A debt to whom?”\n\n“That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. Not because I couldn’t,\nor because I shouldn’t dare, or because it would be damaging, for it’s\nall a paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but—I won’t, because it’s\na matter of principle: that’s my private life, and I won’t allow any\nintrusion into my private life. That’s my principle. Your question has\nno bearing on the case, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is\nmy private affair. I wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of\nhonor but to whom I won’t say.”\n\n“Allow me to make a note of that,” said the prosecutor.\n\n“By all means. Write down that I won’t say, that I won’t. Write that I\nshould think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you’ve\nnothing else to do with your time.”",
            "4": "“Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are\nunaware of it,” the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern\nimpressiveness, “that you have a perfect right not to answer the\nquestions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an\nanswer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason or another.\nThat is entirely a matter for your personal decision. But it is our\nduty, on the other hand, in such cases as the present, to explain and\nset before you the degree of injury you will be doing yourself by\nrefusing to give this or that piece of evidence. After which I will beg\nyou to continue.”\n\n“Gentlemen, I’m not angry ... I ...” Mitya muttered in a rather\ndisconcerted tone. “Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I\nwent then ...”\n\nWe will, of course, not reproduce his account of what is known to the\nreader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest\ndetail. At the same time he was in a hurry to get it over. But as he\ngave his evidence it was written down, and therefore they had\ncontinually to pull him up. Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got\nangry, though still good‐humoredly. He did, it is true, exclaim, from\ntime to time, “Gentlemen, that’s enough to make an angel out of\npatience!” Or, “Gentlemen, it’s no good your irritating me.”\n\nBut even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially\nexpansive mood. So he told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him two\ndays before. (He had completely realized by now that he had been\nfooled.) The sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the\njourney was something new to the lawyers. They were at once greatly\ninterested, and even, to Mitya’s intense indignation, thought it\nnecessary to write the fact down as a secondary confirmation of the\ncircumstance that he had hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time.\nLittle by little Mitya began to grow surly. Then, after describing his\njourney to see Lyagavy, the night spent in the stifling hut, and so on,\nhe came to his return to the town. Here he began, without being\nparticularly urged, to give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy\nhe endured on Grushenka’s account.",
            "5": "He was heard with silent attention. They inquired particularly into the\ncircumstance of his having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna’s\nhouse at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s garden to keep watch on\nGrushenka, and of Smerdyakov’s bringing him information. They laid\nparticular stress on this, and noted it down. Of his jealousy he spoke\nwarmly and at length, and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most\nintimate feelings to “public ignominy,” so to speak, he evidently\novercame his shame in order to tell the truth. The frigid severity,\nwith which the investigating lawyer, and still more the prosecutor,\nstared intently at him as he told his story, disconcerted him at last\nconsiderably.\n\n“That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense about\nwomen only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my\ntelling this to,” he reflected mournfully. “It’s ignominious. ‘Be\npatient, humble, hold thy peace.’ ” He wound up his reflections with\nthat line. But he pulled himself together to go on again. When he came\nto telling of his visit to Madame Hohlakov, he regained his spirits and\neven wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to\ndo with the case. But the investigating lawyer stopped him, and civilly\nsuggested that he should pass on to “more essential matters.” At last,\nwhen he described his despair and told them how, when he left Madame\nHohlakov’s, he thought that he’d “get three thousand if he had to\nmurder some one to do it,” they stopped him again and noted down that\nhe had “meant to murder some one.” Mitya let them write it without\nprotest. At last he reached the point in his story when he learned that\nGrushenka had deceived him and had returned from Samsonov’s as soon as\nhe left her there, though she had said that she would stay there till\nmidnight.\n\n“If I didn’t kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadn’t\ntime,” broke from him suddenly at that point in his story. That, too,\nwas carefully written down. Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to\ntell how he ran into his father’s garden when the investigating lawyer\nsuddenly stopped him, and opening the big portfolio that lay on the\nsofa beside him he brought out the brass pestle.\n\n“Do you recognize this object?” he asked, showing it to Mitya.\n\n“Oh, yes,” he laughed gloomily. “Of course I recognize it. Let me have\na look at it.... Damn it, never mind!”\n\n“You have forgotten to mention it,” observed the investigating lawyer.",
            "6": "“Hang it all, I shouldn’t have concealed it from you. Do you suppose I\ncould have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.”\n\n“Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with\nit.”\n\n“Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen.”\n\nAnd Mitya described how he took the pestle and ran.\n\n“But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a\nweapon?”\n\n“What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off.”\n\n“What for, if you had no object?”\n\nMitya’s wrath flared up. He looked intently at “the boy” and smiled\ngloomily and malignantly. He was feeling more and more ashamed at\nhaving told “such people” the story of his jealousy so sincerely and\nspontaneously.\n\n“Bother the pestle!” broke from him suddenly.\n\n“But still—”\n\n“Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything\nturned up.”\n\n“But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when\nyou went out, since you’re afraid of the dark?”\n\n“Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen! There’s positively no talking to you!”\ncried Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the\nsecretary, crimson with anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in\nhis voice:\n\n“Write down at once ... at once ... ‘that I snatched up the pestle to\ngo and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the\nhead with it!’ Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your minds\nrelieved?” he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers.\n\n“We quite understand that you made that statement just now through\nexasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you\nconsider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,” the prosecutor\nremarked dryly in reply.\n\n“Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does\none pick things up for at such moments? I don’t know what for. I\nsnatched it up and ran—that’s all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or\nI declare I won’t tell you any more.”\n\nHe sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He sat\nsideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of\nnausea. He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare\nthat he wouldn’t say another word, “not if you hang me for it.”",
            "7": "“You see, gentlemen,” he said at last, with difficulty controlling\nhimself, “you see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It’s a\ndream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it—it’s always the\nsame ... that some one is hunting me, some one I’m awfully afraid of\n... that he’s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and\nI hide somewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a\ndegrading way, and the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but\nhe pretends not to know where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to\nenjoy my terror.... That’s just what you’re doing now. It’s just like\nthat!”\n\n“Is that the sort of thing you dream about?” inquired the prosecutor.\n\n“Yes, it is. Don’t you want to write it down?” said Mitya, with a\ndistorted smile.\n\n“No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.”\n\n“It’s not a question of dreams now, gentlemen—this is realism, this is\nreal life! I’m a wolf and you’re the hunters. Well, hunt him down!”\n\n“You are wrong to make such comparisons ...” began Nikolay\nParfenovitch, with extraordinary softness.\n\n“No, I’m not wrong, not at all!” Mitya flared up again, though his\noutburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more good‐\nhumored at every word. “You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial\ntortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable\nimpulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)—no! That you must believe\nyou have no right indeed ... but—\n\nBe silent, heart,\nBe patient, humble, hold thy peace.\n\n\nWell, shall I go on?” he broke off gloomily.\n\n“If you’ll be so kind,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch."

            "0": "Though Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he was trying more\nthan ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story. He told\nthem how he had leapt over the fence into his father’s garden; how he\nhad gone up to the window; told them all that had passed under the\nwindow. Clearly, precisely, distinctly, he described the feelings that\ntroubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so\nterribly to know whether Grushenka was with his father or not. But,\nstrange to say, both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful\nreserve, looked coldly at him, asked few questions. Mitya could gather\nnothing from their faces.\n\n“They’re angry and offended,” he thought. “Well, bother them!”\n\nWhen he described how he made up his mind at last to make the “signal”\nto his father that Grushenka had come, so that he should open the\nwindow, the lawyers paid no attention to the word “signal,” as though\nthey entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this\nconnection: so much so, that Mitya noticed it. Coming at last to the\nmoment when, seeing his father peering out of the window, his hatred\nflared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket, he suddenly, as\nthough of design, stopped short. He sat gazing at the wall and was\naware that their eyes were fixed upon him.\n\n“Well?” said the investigating lawyer. “You pulled out the weapon and\n... and what happened then?”\n\n“Then? Why, then I murdered him ... hit him on the head and cracked his\nskull.... I suppose that’s your story. That’s it!”\n\nHis eyes suddenly flashed. All his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up\nwith extraordinary violence in his soul.\n\n“Our story?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. “Well—and yours?”\n\nMitya dropped his eyes and was a long time silent.\n\n“My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,” he began softly.\n“Whether it was some one’s tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good\nangel kissed me at that instant, I don’t know. But the devil was\nconquered. I rushed from the window and ran to the fence. My father was\nalarmed and, for the first time, he saw me then, cried out, and sprang\nback from the window. I remember that very well. I ran across the\ngarden to the fence ... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting\non the fence.”\n\nAt that point he raised his eyes at last and looked at his listeners.\nThey seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention. A\nsort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya’s soul.",
            "1": "“Why, you’re laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen!” he broke off\nsuddenly.\n\n“What makes you think that?” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“You don’t believe one word—that’s why! I understand, of course, that I\nhave come to the vital point. The old man’s lying there now with his\nskull broken, while I—after dramatically describing how I wanted to\nkill him, and how I snatched up the pestle—I suddenly run away from the\nwindow. A romance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his\nword. Ha ha! You are scoffers, gentlemen!”\n\nAnd he swung round on his chair so that it creaked.\n\n“And did you notice,” asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not\nobserving Mitya’s excitement, “did you notice when you ran away from\nthe window, whether the door into the garden was open?”\n\n“No, it was not open.”\n\n“It was not?”\n\n“It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!” he\nseemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start:\n\n“Why, did you find the door open?”\n\n“Yes, it was open.”\n\n“Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?”\ncried Mitya, greatly astonished.\n\n“The door stood open, and your father’s murderer undoubtedly went in at\nthat door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the\nsame door,” the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling\nout each word separately. “That is perfectly clear. The murder was\ncommitted in the room and _not through the window_; that is absolutely\ncertain from the examination that has been made, from the position of\nthe body and everything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.”\n\nMitya was absolutely dumbfounded.\n\n“But that’s utterly impossible!” he cried, completely at a loss. “I ...\nI didn’t go in.... I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut\nthe whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden. I\nonly stood at the window and saw him through the window. That’s all,\nthat’s all.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didn’t remember,\nit would be just the same. I know it, for no one knew the signals\nexcept Smerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he wouldn’t have\nopened the door to any one in the world without the signals.”",
            "2": "“Signals? What signals?” asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almost\nhysterical, curiosity. He instantly lost all trace of his reserve and\ndignity. He asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. He\nscented an important fact of which he had known nothing, and was\nalready filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.\n\n“So you didn’t know!” Mitya winked at him with a malicious and mocking\nsmile. “What if I won’t tell you? From whom could you find out? No one\nknew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was\nall. Heaven knew, too, but it won’t tell you. But it’s an interesting\nfact. There’s no knowing what you might build on it. Ha ha! Take\ncomfort, gentlemen, I’ll reveal it. You’ve some foolish idea in your\nhearts. You don’t know the man you have to deal with! You have to do\nwith a prisoner who gives evidence against himself, to his own damage!\nYes, for I’m a man of honor and you—are not.”\n\nThe prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He was trembling with\nimpatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them\neverything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for\nSmerdyakov. He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant,\ntapped the signals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said\nthat he supposed he, Mitya, had tapped the signal “Grushenka has come,”\nwhen he tapped to his father, he answered precisely that he had tapped\nthat signal, that “Grushenka had come.”\n\n“So now you can build up your tower,” Mitya broke off, and again turned\naway from them contemptuously.\n\n“So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valet\nSmerdyakov? And no one else?” Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more.\n\n“Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven. That\nmay be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.”\n\nAnd they had already, of course, begun writing it down. But while they\nwrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea:\n\n“But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny\nall responsibility for the death of your father, was it not he,\nperhaps, who knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to\nopen to him, and then ... committed the crime?”\n\nMitya turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred. His\nsilent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink.",
            "3": "“You’ve caught the fox again,” commented Mitya at last; “you’ve got the\nbeast by the tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You\nthought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your\nprompting, and shout with all my might, ‘Aie! it’s Smerdyakov; he’s the\nmurderer.’ Confess that’s what you thought. Confess, and I’ll go on.”\n\nBut the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited.\n\n“You’re mistaken. I’m not going to shout ‘It’s Smerdyakov,’ ” said\nMitya.\n\n“And you don’t even suspect him?”\n\n“Why, do you suspect him?”\n\n“He is suspected, too.”\n\nMitya fixed his eyes on the floor.\n\n“Joking apart,” he brought out gloomily. “Listen. From the very\nbeginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the\ncurtain, I’ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I’ve been\nsitting here, shouting that I’m innocent and thinking all the time\n‘Smerdyakov!’ I can’t get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too,\nthought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I\nthought, ‘No, it’s not Smerdyakov.’ It’s not his doing, gentlemen.”\n\n“In that case is there anybody else you suspect?” Nikolay Parfenovitch\ninquired cautiously.\n\n“I don’t know any one it could be, whether it’s the hand of Heaven or\nSatan, but ... not Smerdyakov,” Mitya jerked out with decision.\n\n“But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it’s\nnot he?”\n\n“From my conviction—my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the\nmost abject character and a coward. He’s not a coward, he’s the epitome\nof all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs. He has the heart\nof a chicken. When he talked to me, he was always trembling for fear I\nshould kill him, though I never raised my hand against him. He fell at\nmy feet and blubbered; he has kissed these very boots, literally,\nbeseeching me ‘not to frighten him.’ Do you hear? ‘Not to frighten\nhim.’ What a thing to say! Why, I offered him money. He’s a puling\nchicken—sickly, epileptic, weak‐minded—a child of eight could thrash\nhim. He has no character worth talking about. It’s not Smerdyakov,\ngentlemen. He doesn’t care for money; he wouldn’t take my presents.\nBesides, what motive had he for murdering the old man? Why, he’s very\nlikely his son, you know—his natural son. Do you know that?”\n\n“We have heard that legend. But you are your father’s son, too, you\nknow; yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him.”",
            "4": "“That’s a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I’m not afraid! Oh,\ngentlemen, isn’t it too base of you to say that to my face? It’s base,\nbecause I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him, but I\nmight have done it. And, what’s more, I went out of my way to tell you\nof my own accord that I nearly murdered him. But, you see, I didn’t\nmurder him; you see, my guardian angel saved me—that’s what you’ve not\ntaken into account. And that’s why it’s so base of you. For I didn’t\nkill him, I didn’t kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.”\n\nHe was almost choking. He had not been so moved before during the whole\ninterrogation.\n\n“And what has he told you, gentlemen—Smerdyakov, I mean?” he added\nsuddenly, after a pause. “May I ask that question?”\n\n“You may ask any question,” the prosecutor replied with frigid\nseverity, “any question relating to the facts of the case, and we are,\nI repeat, bound to answer every inquiry you make. We found the servant\nSmerdyakov, concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his bed,\nin an epileptic fit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly,\nten times. The doctor who was with us told us, after seeing him, that\nhe may possibly not outlive the night.”\n\n“Well, if that’s so, the devil must have killed him,” broke suddenly\nfrom Mitya, as though until that moment he had been asking himself:\n“Was it Smerdyakov or not?”\n\n“We will come back to this later,” Nikolay Parfenovitch decided. “Now,\nwouldn’t you like to continue your statement?”\n\nMitya asked for a rest. His request was courteously granted. After\nresting, he went on with his story. But he was evidently depressed. He\nwas exhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse the\nprosecutor exasperated him, as though intentionally, by vexatious\ninterruptions about “trifling points.” Scarcely had Mitya described\nhow, sitting on the wall, he had struck Grigory on the head with the\npestle, while the old man had hold of his left leg, and how he had then\njumped down to look at him, when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him\nto describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall. Mitya was\nsurprised.\n\n“Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall\nand one on the other.”\n\n“And the pestle?”\n\n“The pestle was in my hand.”\n\n“Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent\nblow you gave him?”\n\n“It must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?”",
            "5": "“Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then\nand showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?”\n\n“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” asked Mitya, looking haughtily\nat the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.\n\nMitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm.\n\n“This was how I struck him! That’s how I knocked him down! What more do\nyou want?”\n\n“Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with\nwhat object, and what you had in view?”\n\n“Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I’d hurt ... I don’t\nknow what for!”\n\n“Though you were so excited and were running away?”\n\n“Yes, though I was excited and running away.”\n\n“You wanted to help him?”\n\n“Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him.... I don’t remember.”\n\n“You don’t remember? Then you didn’t quite know what you were doing?”\n\n“Not at all. I remember everything—every detail. I jumped down to look\nat him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.”\n\n“We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to\nconsciousness?”\n\n“I don’t know whether I hoped it. I simply wanted to make sure whether\nhe was alive or not.”\n\n“Ah! You wanted to be sure? Well, what then?”\n\n“I’m not a doctor. I couldn’t decide. I ran away thinking I’d killed\nhim. And now he’s recovered.”\n\n“Excellent,” commented the prosecutor. “Thank you. That’s all I wanted.\nKindly proceed.”\n\nAlas! it never entered Mitya’s head to tell them, though he remembered\nit, that he had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate\nfigure had even uttered some words of regret: “You’ve come to grief,\nold man—there’s no help for it. Well, there you must lie.”\n\nThe prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumped\nback “at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of\nascertaining whether the _only_ witness of his crime were dead; that he\nmust therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision\nand foresight even at such a moment,” ... and so on. The prosecutor was\nsatisfied: “I’ve provoked the nervous fellow by ‘trifles’ and he has\nsaid more than he meant to.”\n\nWith painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he was pulled up\nimmediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands\nso covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?”\n\n“Why, I didn’t notice the blood at all at the time,” answered Mitya.",
            "6": "“That’s quite likely. It does happen sometimes.” The prosecutor\nexchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“I simply didn’t notice. You’re quite right there, prosecutor,” Mitya\nassented suddenly.\n\nNext came the account of Mitya’s sudden determination to “step aside”\nand make way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to\nopen his heart to them as before, and tell them about “the queen of his\nsoul.” He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons “who\nwere fastening on him like bugs.” And so in response to their\nreiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly:\n\n“Well, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for?\nThat question stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come\nback, the man who wronged her but who’d hurried back to offer his love,\nafter five years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew\nit was all over for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that\nblood—Grigory’s.... What had I to live for? So I went to redeem the\npistols I had pledged, to load them and put a bullet in my brain\nto‐morrow.”\n\n“And a grand feast the night before?”\n\n“Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make\nhaste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond\nthe village, and I’d planned to do it at five o’clock in the morning.\nAnd I had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin’s when I\nloaded my pistols. Here’s the letter. Read it! It’s not for you I tell\nit,” he added contemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and\nflung it on the table. The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is\nusual, added it to the papers connected with the case.\n\n“And you didn’t even think of washing your hands at Perhotin’s? You\nwere not afraid then of arousing suspicion?”\n\n“What suspicion? Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just the\nsame, and shot myself at five o’clock, and you wouldn’t have been in\ntime to do anything. If it hadn’t been for what’s happened to my\nfather, you would have known nothing about it, and wouldn’t have come\nhere. Oh, it’s the devil’s doing. It was the devil murdered father, it\nwas through the devil that you found it out so soon. How did you manage\nto get here so quick? It’s marvelous, a dream!”\n\n“Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him, you held in your\nhands ... your blood‐stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money\n... a bundle of hundred‐rouble notes, and that his servant‐boy saw it\ntoo.”",
            "7": "“That’s true, gentlemen. I remember it was so.”\n\n“Now, there’s one little point presents itself. Can you inform us,”\nNikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, “where did you get\nso much money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from the\nreckoning of time, that you had not been home?”\n\nThe prosecutor’s brows contracted at the question being asked so\nplainly, but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“No, I didn’t go home,” answered Mitya, apparently perfectly composed,\nbut looking at the floor.\n\n“Allow me then to repeat my question,” Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as\nthough creeping up to the subject. “Where were you able to procure such\na sum all at once, when by your own confession, at five o’clock the\nsame day you—”\n\n“I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin, and\nthen went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she\nwouldn’t give me, and so on, and all the rest of it,” Mitya interrupted\nsharply. “Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands\nturned up, eh? Do you know, gentlemen, you’re both afraid now ‘what if\nhe won’t tell us where he got it?’ That’s just how it is. I’m not going\nto tell you, gentlemen. You’ve guessed right. You’ll never know,” said\nMitya, chipping out each word with extraordinary determination. The\nlawyers were silent for a moment.\n\n“You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for\nus to know,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.\n\n“I understand; but still I won’t tell you.”\n\nThe prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that\nhe was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he thought it to\nhis interest, and so on. But in view of the damage he might do himself\nby his silence, especially in a case of such importance as—\n\n“And so on, gentlemen, and so on. Enough! I’ve heard that rigmarole\nbefore,” Mitya interrupted again. “I can see for myself how important\nit is, and that this is the vital point, and still I won’t say.”\n\n“What is it to us? It’s not our business, but yours. You are doing\nyourself harm,” observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously.",
            "8": "“You see, gentlemen, joking apart”—Mitya lifted his eyes and looked\nfirmly at them both—“I had an inkling from the first that we should\ncome to loggerheads at this point. But at first when I began to give my\nevidence, it was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and\nI was so simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence\nexisting between us. Now I can see for myself that such confidence is\nout of the question, for in any case we were bound to come to this\ncursed stumbling‐ block. And now we’ve come to it! It’s impossible and\nthere’s an end of it! But I don’t blame you. You can’t believe it all\nsimply on my word. I understand that, of course.”\n\nHe relapsed into gloomy silence.\n\n“Couldn’t you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about\nthe chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight\nhint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce\nyou to refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?”\n\nMitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily.\n\n“I’m much more good‐natured than you think, gentlemen. I’ll tell you\nthe reason why and give you that hint, though you don’t deserve it. I\nwon’t speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my\nhonor. The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me\nto far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I\nhad murdered and robbed him. That’s why I can’t tell you. I can’t for\nfear of disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?”\n\n“Yes, we’ll write it down,” lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“You ought not to write that down about ‘disgrace.’ I only told you\nthat in the goodness of my heart. I needn’t have told you. I made you a\npresent of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once. Oh, well,\nwrite—write what you like,” he concluded, with scornful disgust. “I’m\nnot afraid of you and I can still hold up my head before you.”\n\n“And can’t you tell us the nature of that disgrace?” Nikolay\nParfenovitch hazarded.\n\nThe prosecutor frowned darkly.\n\n“No, no, _c’est fini_, don’t trouble yourselves. It’s not worth while\nsoiling one’s hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is.\nYou’re not worth it—no one is ... Enough, gentlemen. I’m not going on.”\n\nThis was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist\nfurther, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch’s eyes he saw that he had not\ngiven up hope.",
            "9": "“Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when you\nwent into Mr. Perhotin’s—how many roubles exactly?”\n\n“I can’t tell you that.”\n\n“You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three\nthousand from Madame Hohlakov.”\n\n“Perhaps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I won’t say how much I had.”\n\n“Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you\nhave done since you arrived?”\n\n“Oh! you might ask the people here about that. But I’ll tell you if you\nlike.”\n\nHe proceeded to do so, but we won’t repeat his story. He told it dryly\nand curtly. Of the raptures of his love he said nothing, but told them\nthat he abandoned his determination to shoot himself, owing to “new\nfactors in the case.” He told the story without going into motives or\ndetails. And this time the lawyers did not worry him much. It was\nobvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here.\n\n“We shall verify all that. We will come back to it during the\nexamination of the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your\npresence,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion. “And now allow me\nto request you to lay on the table everything in your possession,\nespecially all the money you still have about you.”\n\n“My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary.\nI’m surprised, indeed, that you haven’t inquired about it before. It’s\ntrue I couldn’t get away anywhere. I’m sitting here where I can be\nseen. But here’s my money—count it—take it. That’s all, I think.”\n\nHe turned it all out of his pockets; even the small change—two pieces\nof twenty copecks—he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket. They counted\nthe money, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty‐six roubles, and\nforty copecks.\n\n“And is that all?” asked the investigating lawyer.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred\nroubles at Plotnikovs’. You gave Perhotin ten, your driver twenty, here\nyou lost two hundred, then....”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up. Mitya helped him readily. They\nrecollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. Nikolay\nParfenovitch hurriedly added up the total.\n\n“With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at\nfirst?”\n\n“I suppose so,” snapped Mitya.\n\n“How is it they all assert there was much more?”\n\n“Let them assert it.”\n\n“But you asserted it yourself.”\n\n“Yes, I did, too.”",
            "10": "“We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet\nexamined. Don’t be anxious about your money. It will be properly taken\ncare of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is\nbeginning ... if it appears, or, so to speak, is proved that you have\nundisputed right to it. Well, and now....”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up, and informed Mitya firmly that it\nwas his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search “of\nyour clothes and everything else....”\n\n“By all means, gentlemen. I’ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.”\n\nAnd he did, in fact, begin turning out his pockets.\n\n“It will be necessary to take off your clothes, too.”\n\n“What! Undress? Ugh! Damn it! Won’t you search me as I am! Can’t you?”\n\n“It’s utterly impossible, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You must take off your\nclothes.”\n\n“As you like,” Mitya submitted gloomily; “only, please, not here, but\nbehind the curtains. Who will search them?”\n\n“Behind the curtains, of course.”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore an\nexpression of peculiar solemnity."

            "0": "Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could\nnever, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave\nlike that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was\nsomething humiliating in it, and on their side something “supercilious\nand scornful.” It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to\nundress further, or rather not asked but “commanded,” he quite\nunderstood that. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word.\nSeveral peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side\nof the curtain. “To be ready if force is required,” thought Mitya, “and\nperhaps for some other reason, too.”\n\n“Well, must I take off my shirt, too?” he asked sharply, but Nikolay\nParfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor\nin examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it\nwas evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. “They\nmake no bones about it,” thought Mitya, “they don’t keep up the most\nelementary politeness.”\n\n“I ask you for the second time—need I take off my shirt or not?” he\nsaid, still more sharply and irritably.\n\n“Don’t trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,” Nikolay\nParfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it\nseemed to Mitya.\n\nMeantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.\nThere turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the\nback, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff. There were\nbloodstains on the trousers, too. Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in\nthe presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his fingers along the\ncollar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat and trousers,\nobviously looking for something—money, of course. He didn’t even hide\nfrom Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his\nclothes.\n\n“He treats me not as an officer but as a thief,” Mitya muttered to\nhimself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing\nfrankness. The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the\ncurtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch’s\nattention to the cap, which they were also fingering.\n\n“You remember Gridyenko, the copying‐clerk,” observed the secretary.\n“Last summer he received the wages of the whole office, and pretended\nto have lost the money when he was drunk. And where was it found? Why,\nin just such pipings in his cap. The hundred‐rouble notes were screwed\nup in little rolls and sewed in the piping.”",
            "1": "Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko’s case perfectly, and so laid\naside Mitya’s cap, and decided that all his clothes must be more\nthoroughly examined later.\n\n“Excuse me,” cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the\nright cuff of Mitya’s shirt was turned in, and covered with blood,\n“excuse me, what’s that, blood?”\n\n“Yes,” Mitya jerked out.\n\n“That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?”\n\nMitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking\nafter Grigory, and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands\nat Perhotin’s.\n\n“You must take off your shirt, too. That’s very important as material\nevidence.”\n\nMitya flushed red and flew into a rage.\n\n“What, am I to stay naked?” he shouted.\n\n“Don’t disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take\noff your socks.”\n\n“You’re not joking? Is that really necessary?” Mitya’s eyes flashed.\n\n“We are in no mood for joking,” answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly.\n\n“Well, if I must—” muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he took\noff his socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All were clothed, while he\nwas naked, and strange to say, when he was undressed he felt somehow\nguilty in their presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that\nhe was inferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to\ndespise him.\n\n“When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one’s the\nonly one undressed and everybody is looking, it’s degrading,” he kept\nrepeating to himself, again and again. “It’s like a dream, I’ve\nsometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions.” It was a\nmisery to him to take off his socks. They were very dirty, and so were\nhis underclothes, and now every one could see it. And what was worse,\nhe disliked his feet. All his life he had thought both his big toes\nhideous. He particularly loathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the\nright one, and now they would all see it. Feeling intolerably ashamed\nmade him, at once and intentionally, rougher. He pulled off his shirt,\nhimself.\n\n“Would you like to look anywhere else if you’re not ashamed to?”\n\n“No, there’s no need to, at present.”\n\n“Well, am I to stay naked like this?” he added savagely.\n\n“Yes, that can’t be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a\nwhile. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ... I’ll\nsee to all this.”",
            "2": "All the things were shown to the witnesses. The report of the search\nwas drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the\nclothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too.\nMitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never\ntaking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He\nfelt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he couldn’t pull the quilt over\nso as to cover them. Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long\ntime, “an insufferable time.” “He thinks of me as a puppy,” thought\nMitya, gnashing his teeth. “That rotten prosecutor has gone, too,\ncontemptuous no doubt, it disgusts him to see me naked!”\n\nMitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and\nreturned to him. But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch\ncame back with quite different clothes, brought in behind him by a\npeasant.\n\n“Here are clothes for you,” he observed airily, seeming well satisfied\nwith the success of his mission. “Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided\nthese for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt. Luckily he\nhad them all in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and\nunderclothes.”\n\nMitya flew into a passion.\n\n“I won’t have other people’s clothes!” he shouted menacingly, “give me\nmy own!”\n\n“It’s impossible!”\n\n“Give me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!”\n\nIt was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded\nsomehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes,\nbeing stained with blood, must be “included with the other material\nevidence,” and that they “had not even the right to let him have them\nnow ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.”\nMitya at last understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and\nhurriedly dressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that\nthe clothes were much better than his old ones, and that he disliked\n“gaining by the change.” The coat was, besides, “ridiculously tight. Am\nI to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?”\n\nThey urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was\nonly a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too\nlong. But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.\n\n“Damn it all! I can hardly button it,” Mitya grumbled. “Be so good as\nto tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn’t ask for his clothes, and\nit’s not my doing that they’ve dressed me up like a clown.”",
            "3": "“He understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you\nhis clothes, but sorry about all this business,” mumbled Nikolay\nParfenovitch.\n\n“Confound his sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here?”\n\nHe was asked to go back to the “other room.” Mitya went in, scowling\nwith anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. Dressed in another\nman’s clothes he felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the\npeasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some\nreason, in the doorway, and vanished immediately. “He’s come to look at\nme dressed up,” thought Mitya. He sat down on the same chair as before.\nHe had an absurd nightmarish feeling, as though he were out of his\nmind.\n\n“Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That’s all that’s left for\nyou,” he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor. He\nwould not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he disdained to speak\nto him.\n\n“He looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on\npurpose to show every one how dirty they were—the scoundrel!”\n\n“Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,” observed\nNikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya’s question.\n\n“Yes,” said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on\nsomething.\n\n“We’ve done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,”\nNikolay Parfenovitch went on, “but having received from you such an\nuncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you\nobtained the money found upon you, we are, at the present moment—”\n\n“What is the stone in your ring?” Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though\nawakening from a reverie. He pointed to one of the three large rings\nadorning Nikolay Parfenovitch’s right hand.\n\n“Ring?” repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise.\n\n“Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it,\nwhat stone is that?” Mitya persisted, like a peevish child.\n\n“That’s a smoky topaz,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. “Would you\nlike to look at it? I’ll take it off ...”",
            "4": "“No, don’t take it off,” cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and\nangry with himself. “Don’t take it off ... there’s no need.... Damn\nit!... Gentlemen, you’ve sullied my heart! Can you suppose that I would\nconceal it from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would\nshuffle, lie, and hide myself? No, that’s not like Dmitri Karamazov,\nthat he couldn’t do, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn’t have\nwaited for your coming, or for the sunrise as I meant at first, but\nshould have killed myself before this, without waiting for the dawn! I\nknow that about myself now. I couldn’t have learnt so much in twenty\nyears as I’ve found out in this accursed night!... And should I have\nbeen like this on this night, and at this moment, sitting with you,\ncould I have talked like this, could I have moved like this, could I\nhave looked at you and at the world like this, if I had really been the\nmurderer of my father, when the very thought of having accidentally\nkilled Grigory gave me no peace all night—not from fear—oh, not simply\nfrom fear of your punishment! The disgrace of it! And you expect me to\nbe open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe in\nnothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty thing\nI’ve done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from your\naccusation! No, better Siberia! The man who opened the door to my\nfather and went in at that door, he killed him, he robbed him. Who was\nhe? I’m racking my brains and can’t think who. But I can tell you it\nwas not Dmitri Karamazov, and that’s all I can tell you, and that’s\nenough, enough, leave me alone.... Exile me, punish me, but don’t\nbother me any more. I’ll say no more. Call your witnesses!”\n\nMitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be\nabsolutely silent for the future. The prosecutor watched him the whole\ntime and only when he had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were\nthe most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:",
            "5": "“Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well\ninform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of\nthe greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us\nby Grigory, the old man you wounded. On his recovery, he clearly and\nemphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming\nout to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his\nmind to go into it through the little gate which stood open, before he\nnoticed you running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the\nopen window where you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the\nleft, and, while noticing the open window, observed at the same time,\nmuch nearer to him, the door, standing wide open—that door which you\nhave stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden. I\nwill not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and\nbears witness that you must have run from that door, though, of course,\nhe did not see you do so with his own eyes, since he only noticed you\nfirst some distance away in the garden, running towards the fence.”\n\nMitya had leapt up from his chair half‐way through this speech.\n\n“Nonsense!” he yelled, in a sudden frenzy, “it’s a barefaced lie. He\ncouldn’t have seen the door open because it was shut. He’s lying!”\n\n“I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement. He\ndoes not waver. He adheres to it. We’ve cross‐examined him several\ntimes.”\n\n“Precisely. I have cross‐examined him several times,” Nikolay\nParfenovitch confirmed warmly.\n\n“It’s false, false! It’s either an attempt to slander me, or the\nhallucination of a madman,” Mitya still shouted. “He’s simply raving,\nfrom loss of blood, from the wound. He must have fancied it when he\ncame to.... He’s raving.”\n\n“Yes, but he noticed the open door, not when he came to after his\ninjuries, but before that, as soon as he went into the garden from the\nlodge.”\n\n“But it’s false, it’s false! It can’t be so! He’s slandering me from\nspite.... He couldn’t have seen it ... I didn’t come from the door,”\ngasped Mitya.\n\nThe prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him\nimpressively:\n\n“Confront him with it.”\n\n“Do you recognize this object?”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official\nenvelope, on which three seals still remained intact. The envelope was\nempty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes.",
            "6": "“It ... it must be that envelope of my father’s, the envelope that\ncontained the three thousand roubles ... and if there’s inscribed on\nit, allow me, ‘For my little chicken’ ... yes—three thousand!” he\nshouted, “do you see, three thousand, do you see?”\n\n“Of course, we see. But we didn’t find the money in it. It was empty,\nand lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.”\n\nFor some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck.\n\n“Gentlemen, it’s Smerdyakov!” he shouted suddenly, at the top of his\nvoice. “It’s he who’s murdered him! He’s robbed him! No one else knew\nwhere the old man hid the envelope. It’s Smerdyakov, that’s clear,\nnow!”\n\n“But you, too, knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow.”\n\n“I never knew it. I’ve never seen it. This is the first time I’ve\nlooked at it. I’d only heard of it from Smerdyakov.... He was the only\none who knew where the old man kept it hidden, I didn’t know ...” Mitya\nwas completely breathless.\n\n“But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased\nfather’s pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so\nyou must have known it.”\n\n“We’ve got it written down,” confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“Nonsense! It’s absurd! I’d no idea it was under the pillow. And\nperhaps it wasn’t under the pillow at all.... It was just a chance\nguess that it was under the pillow. What does Smerdyakov say? Have you\nasked him where it was? What does Smerdyakov say? that’s the chief\npoint.... And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself.... I\ntold you without thinking that it was under the pillow, and now you—\nOh, you know how one says the wrong thing, without meaning it. No one\nknew but Smerdyakov, only Smerdyakov, and no one else.... He didn’t\neven tell me where it was! But it’s his doing, his doing; there’s no\ndoubt about it, he murdered him, that’s as clear as daylight now,”\nMitya exclaimed more and more frantically, repeating himself\nincoherently, and growing more and more exasperated and excited. “You\nmust understand that, and arrest him at once.... He must have killed\nhim while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious, that’s\nclear now.... He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no\none but he knew the signal, and without the signal father would never\nhave opened the door....”",
            "7": "“But you’re again forgetting the circumstance,” the prosecutor\nobserved, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of\ntriumph, “that there was no need to give the signal if the door already\nstood open when you were there, while you were in the garden....”\n\n“The door, the door,” muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the\nprosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent.\n\n“Yes, the door!... It’s a nightmare! God is against me!” he exclaimed,\nstaring before him in complete stupefaction.\n\n“Come, you see,” the prosecutor went on with dignity, “and you can\njudge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the\nevidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact which\noverwhelms you and us. On the other side your incomprehensible,\npersistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence with regard to the\nsource from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in\nyour hands, when only three hours earlier, on your own showing, you\npledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles! In view of all these\nfacts, judge for yourself. What are we to believe, and what can we\ndepend upon? And don’t accuse us of being ‘frigid, cynical, scoffing\npeople,’ who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of\nyour heart.... Try to enter into our position ...”\n\nMitya was indescribably agitated. He turned pale.\n\n“Very well!” he exclaimed suddenly. “I will tell you my secret. I’ll\ntell you where I got the money!... I’ll reveal my shame, that I may not\nhave to blame myself or you hereafter.”\n\n“And believe me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch, in\na voice of almost pathetic delight, “that every sincere and complete\nconfession on your part at this moment may, later on, have an immense\ninfluence in your favor, and may, indeed, moreover—”\n\nBut the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table, and he\nchecked himself in time. Mitya, it is true, had not heard him."

            "0": "“Gentlemen,” he began, still in the same agitation, “I want to make a\nfull confession: that money was _my own_.” The lawyers’ faces\nlengthened. That was not at all what they expected.\n\n“How do you mean?” faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch, “when at five o’clock\non the same day, from your own confession—”\n\n“Damn five o’clock on the same day and my own confession! That’s\nnothing to do with it now! That money was my own, my own, that is,\nstolen by me ... not mine, I mean, but stolen by me, and it was fifteen\nhundred roubles, and I had it on me all the time, all the time ...”\n\n“But where did you get it?”\n\n“I took it off my neck, gentlemen, off this very neck ... it was here,\nround my neck, sewn up in a rag, and I’d had it round my neck a long\ntime, it’s a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and\ndisgrace!”\n\n“And from whom did you ... appropriate it?”\n\n“You mean, ‘steal it’? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I\npractically stole it, but, if you prefer, I ‘appropriated it.’ I\nconsider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.”\n\n“Last night? But you said that it’s a month since you ... obtained\nit?...”\n\n“Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don’t be uneasy. I\ndidn’t steal it from my father, but from her. Let me tell you without\ninterrupting. It’s hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was\nsent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed. Do you know her?”\n\n“Yes, of course.”\n\n“I know you know her. She’s a noble creature, noblest of the noble. But\nshe has hated me ever so long, oh, ever so long ... and hated me with\ngood reason, good reason!”\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna!” Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The\nprosecutor, too, stared.",
            "1": "“Oh, don’t take her name in vain! I’m a scoundrel to bring her into it.\nYes, I’ve seen that she hated me ... a long while.... From the very\nfirst, even that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough. You’re\nunworthy even to know of that. No need of that at all.... I need only\ntell you that she sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand\nroubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow (as\nthough she couldn’t have sent it off herself!) and I ... it was just at\nthat fatal moment in my life when I ... well, in fact, when I’d just\ncome to love another, her, she’s sitting down below now, Grushenka. I\ncarried her off here to Mokroe then, and wasted here in two days half\nthat damned three thousand, but the other half I kept on me. Well, I’ve\nkept that other half, that fifteen hundred, like a locket round my\nneck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent it. What’s left of it, eight\nhundred roubles, is in your hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch. That’s the\nchange out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday.”\n\n“Excuse me. How’s that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent\nthree thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.”\n\n“Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?”\n\n“Why, you told every one yourself that you’d spent exactly three\nthousand.”\n\n“It’s true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said\nso. And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand.\nYet I didn’t spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other\nfifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That’s how it was,\ngentlemen. That’s where I got that money yesterday....”\n\n“This is almost miraculous,” murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch.\n\n“Allow me to inquire,” observed the prosecutor at last, “have you\ninformed any one whatever of this circumstance before, I mean that you\nhad fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?”\n\n“I told no one.”\n\n“That’s strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?”\n\n“Absolutely no one. No one and nobody.”",
            "2": "“What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for\nmaking such a secret of it? To be more precise: You have told us at\nlast your secret, in your words, so ‘disgraceful,’ though in\nreality—that is, of course, comparatively speaking—this action, that\nis, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to some one\nelse, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at least, only an\nact of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes\ninto consideration your character.... Even admitting that it was an\naction in the highest degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not\n‘disgraceful.’... Many people have already guessed, during this last\nmonth, about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna’s, that you have\nspent, and I heard the legend myself, apart from your confession....\nMihail Makarovitch, for instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it\nwas scarcely a legend, but the gossip of the whole town. There are\nindications, too, if I am not mistaken, that you confessed this\nyourself to some one, I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna’s,\nand so, it’s extremely surprising to me that hitherto, that is, up to\nthe present moment, you have made such an extraordinary secret of the\nfifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently connecting a feeling of\npositive horror with that secret.... It’s not easy to believe that it\ncould cost you such distress to confess such a secret.... You cried\nout, just now, that Siberia would be better than confessing it ...”\n\nThe prosecutor ceased speaking. He was provoked. He did not conceal his\nvexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his accumulated\nspleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.\n\n“It’s not the fifteen hundred that’s the disgrace, but that I put it\napart from the rest of the three thousand,” said Mitya firmly.\n\n“Why?” smiled the prosecutor irritably. “What is there disgraceful, to\nyour thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you\nhad discreditably, if you prefer, ‘disgracefully,’ appropriated? Your\ntaking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it.\nAnd by the way, why did you do that—why did you set apart that half,\nfor what purpose, for what object did you do it? Can you explain that\nto us?”",
            "3": "“Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point!” cried Mitya. “I put it\naside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be\ncalculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going\non a whole month.”\n\n“It’s incomprehensible.”\n\n“I wonder at you. But I’ll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is\nincomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say. I appropriate three\nthousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it\nall, and next morning I go to her and say, ‘Katya, I’ve done wrong,\nI’ve squandered your three thousand,’ well, is that right? No, it’s not\nright—it’s dishonest and cowardly, I’m a beast, with no more\nself‐control than a beast, that’s so, isn’t it? But still I’m not a\nthief? Not a downright thief, you’ll admit! I squandered it, but I\ndidn’t steal it. Now a second, rather more favorable alternative:\nfollow me carefully, or I may get confused again—my head’s going\nround—and so, for the second alternative: I spend here only fifteen\nhundred out of the three thousand, that is, only half. Next day I go\nand take that half to her: ‘Katya, take this fifteen hundred from me,\nI’m a low beast, and an untrustworthy scoundrel, for I’ve wasted half\nthe money, and I shall waste this, too, so keep me from temptation!’\nWell, what of that alternative? I should be a beast and a scoundrel,\nand whatever you like; but not a thief, not altogether a thief, or I\nshould not have brought back what was left, but have kept that, too.\nShe would see at once that since I brought back half, I should pay back\nwhat I’d spent, that I should never give up trying to, that I should\nwork to get it and pay it back. So in that case I should be a\nscoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!”\n\n“I admit that there is a certain distinction,” said the prosecutor,\nwith a cold smile. “But it’s strange that you see such a vital\ndifference.”",
            "4": "“Yes, I see a vital difference! Every man may be a scoundrel, and\nperhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it\ntakes an arch‐scoundrel to be that. Oh, of course, I don’t know how to\nmake these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel,\nthat’s my conviction. Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month,\nI may make up my mind to give it back to‐morrow, and I’m a scoundrel no\nlonger, but I cannot make up my mind, you see, though I’m making up my\nmind every day, and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for\na whole month I can’t bring myself to it, you see. Is that right to\nyour thinking, is that right?”\n\n“Certainly, that’s not right, that I can quite understand, and that I\ndon’t dispute,” answered the prosecutor with reserve. “And let us give\nup all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you\nwill be so kind, get back to the point. And the point is, that you have\nstill not told us, altogether we’ve asked you, why, in the first place,\nyou halved the money, squandering one half and hiding the other? For\nwhat purpose exactly did you hide it, what did you mean to do with that\nfifteen hundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“Yes, of course!” cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead;\n“forgive me, I’m worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point,\nor you’d understand in a minute, for it’s just the motive of it that’s\nthe disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead\nfather. He was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was\njealous; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him. So\nI kept thinking every day, suppose she were to make up her mind all of\na sudden, suppose she were to leave off tormenting me, and were\nsuddenly to say to me, ‘I love you, not him; take me to the other end\nof the world.’ And I’d only forty copecks; how could I take her away,\nwhat could I do? Why, I’d be lost. You see, I didn’t know her then, I\ndidn’t understand her, I thought she wanted money, and that she\nwouldn’t forgive my poverty. And so I fiendishly counted out the half\nof that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on it, sewed it up\nbefore I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off to get drunk\non the rest. Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?”\n\nBoth the lawyers laughed aloud.",
            "5": "“I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have\nsquandered it all,” chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, “for after all what\ndoes it amount to?”\n\n“Why, that I stole it, that’s what it amounts to! Oh, God, you horrify\nme by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn\nup round my neck, every day and every hour I said to myself, ‘You’re a\nthief! you’re a thief!’ Yes, that’s why I’ve been so savage all this\nmonth, that’s why I fought in the tavern, that’s why I attacked my\nfather, it was because I felt I was a thief. I couldn’t make up my\nmind, I didn’t dare even to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that\nfifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket.\nBut, do you know, while I carried it I said to myself at the same time\nevery hour: ‘No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you may yet not be a thief.’ Why?\nBecause I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya.\nAnd only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on\nmy way from Fenya’s to Perhotin. I hadn’t been able till that moment to\nbring myself to it. And it was only when I tore it off that I became a\ndownright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life.\nWhy? Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to Katya\nand saying, ‘I’m a scoundrel, but not a thief!’ Do you understand now?\nDo you understand?”\n\n“What was it made you decide to do it yesterday?” Nikolay Parfenovitch\ninterrupted.\n\n“Why? It’s absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five\no’clock this morning, here, at dawn. I thought it made no difference\nwhether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it’s not so, it\nturns out that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, what\nhas tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that\nI’d killed the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just\nwhen my love was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again. Oh,\nthat did torture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned\nconsciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last\nand spent it, and had become a downright thief! Oh, gentlemen, I tell\nyou again, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this\nnight. I have learnt that it’s not only impossible to live a scoundrel,\nbut impossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die\nhonest....”\n\nMitya was pale. His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of\nhis being intensely excited.",
            "6": "“I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” the prosecutor\nsaid slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone. “But all this, if\nyou’ll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ...\nyour overwrought nerves, that’s what it is. And why, for instance,\nshould you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by\ngoing and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted\nit to you? And why could you not have explained things to her, and in\nview of your position, which you describe as being so awful, why could\nyou not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have\noccurred to one’s mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors\nto her, why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for\nyour expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly not\nhave refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with some\nguarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant\nSamsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? I suppose you still regard that\nsecurity as of value?”\n\nMitya suddenly crimsoned.\n\n“Surely you don’t think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You\ncan’t be speaking in earnest?” he said, with indignation, looking the\nprosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his\nears.\n\n“I assure you I’m in earnest.... Why do you imagine I’m not serious?”\nIt was the prosecutor’s turn to be surprised.\n\n“Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are\ntorturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I’ll confess all my\ninfernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you’ll be surprised\nyourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions\ncan sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan\nyou spoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had\nthat thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the\npoint of deciding to go to Katya—I was mean enough for that. But to go\nto her, to tell her of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to\ncarry it out, for the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from\nher, Katya (to beg, do you hear, to beg), and go straight from her to\nrun away with the other, the rival, who hated and insulted her—to think\nof it! You must be mad, prosecutor!”",
            "7": "“Mad I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that\nfeminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you\nassert ... yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,” said the\nprosecutor, smiling.\n\n“But that would have been so infamous!” Mitya brought his fist down on\nthe table fiercely. “That would have been filthy beyond everything!\nYes, do you know that she might have given me that money, yes, and she\nwould have given it, too; she’d have been certain to give it, to be\nrevenged on me, she’d have given it to satisfy her vengeance, to show\nher contempt for me, for hers is an infernal nature, too, and she’s a\nwoman of great wrath. I’d have taken the money, too, oh, I should have\ntaken it; I should have taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ...\noh, God! Forgive me, gentlemen, I’m making such an outcry because I’ve\nhad that thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday,\nthat night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and\nafterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened\n...”\n\n“Till what happened?” put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but\nMitya did not hear it.\n\n“I have made you an awful confession,” Mitya said gloomily in\nconclusion. “You must appreciate it, and what’s more, you must respect\nit, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you’ve simply\nno respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame\nat having confessed it to men like you! Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes,\nI see, I see already that you don’t believe me. What, you want to write\nthat down, too?” he cried in dismay.\n\n“Yes, what you said just now,” said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at\nhim in surprise, “that is, that up to the last hour you were still\ncontemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her.... I\nassure you, that’s a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you,\nparticularly important for you.”\n\n“Have mercy, gentlemen!” Mitya flung up his hands. “Don’t write that,\nanyway; have some shame. Here I’ve torn my heart asunder before you,\nand you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both\nhalves.... Oh, my God!”\n\nIn despair he hid his face in his hands.",
            "8": "“Don’t worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” observed the\nprosecutor, “everything that is written down will be read over to you\nafterwards, and what you don’t agree to we’ll alter as you like. But\nnow I’ll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no one,\nabsolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed up? That, I\nmust tell you, is almost impossible to believe.”\n\n“No one, no one, I told you so before, or you’ve not understood\nanything! Let me alone!”\n\n“Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there’s plenty of\ntime for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses\nthat you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere\nabout the three thousand you’d spent here; three thousand, not fifteen\nhundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had\nyesterday, you gave many people to understand that you had brought\nthree thousand with you.”\n\n“You’ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred\nwitnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!” cried\nMitya.\n\n“Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ means\nsomething.”\n\n“It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.”\n\n“But what need had you to ‘talk rot,’ as you call it?”\n\n“The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much\nmoney.... To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes,\nthat was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?\nWell, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I’d said it, I\ndidn’t care to correct it. What does a man tell lies for sometimes?”\n\n“That’s very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man\ntell lies,” observed the prosecutor impressively. “Tell me, though, was\nthat ‘amulet,’ as you call it, on your neck, a big thing?”\n\n“No, not big.”\n\n“How big, for instance?”\n\n“If you fold a hundred‐rouble note in half, that would be the size.”\n\n“You’d better show us the remains of it. You must have them somewhere.”\n\n“Damnation, what nonsense! I don’t know where they are.”\n\n“But excuse me: where and when did you take it off your neck? According\nto your own evidence you didn’t go home.”\n\n“When I was going from Fenya’s to Perhotin’s, on the way I tore it off\nmy neck and took out the money.”\n\n“In the dark?”\n\n“What should I want a light for? I did it with my fingers in one\nminute.”\n\n“Without scissors, in the street?”\n\n“In the market‐place I think it was. Why scissors? It was an old rag.\nIt was torn in a minute.”",
            "9": "“Where did you put it afterwards?”\n\n“I dropped it there.”\n\n“Where was it, exactly?”\n\n“In the market‐place, in the market‐place! The devil knows whereabouts.\nWhat do you want to know for?”\n\n“That’s extremely important, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. It would be material\nevidence in your favor. How is it you don’t understand that? Who helped\nyou to sew it up a month ago?”\n\n“No one helped me. I did it myself.”\n\n“Can you sew?”\n\n“A soldier has to know how to sew. No knowledge was needed to do that.”\n\n“Where did you get the material, that is, the rag in which you sewed\nthe money?”\n\n“Are you laughing at me?”\n\n“Not at all. And we are in no mood for laughing, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“I don’t know where I got the rag from—somewhere, I suppose.”\n\n“I should have thought you couldn’t have forgotten it?”\n\n“Upon my word, I don’t remember. I might have torn a bit off my linen.”\n\n“That’s very interesting. We might find in your lodgings to‐morrow the\nshirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag. What sort of rag\nwas it, cloth or linen?”\n\n“Goodness only knows what it was. Wait a bit.... I believe I didn’t\ntear it off anything. It was a bit of calico.... I believe I sewed it\nup in a cap of my landlady’s.”\n\n“In your landlady’s cap?”\n\n“Yes. I took it from her.”\n\n“How did you get it?”\n\n“You see, I remember once taking a cap for a rag, perhaps to wipe my\npen on. I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I\ntore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it. I believe it\nwas in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a\nthousand times.”\n\n“And you remember that for certain now?”\n\n“I don’t know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang\nit, what does it matter?”\n\n“In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost?”\n\n“No, she won’t, she didn’t miss it. It was an old rag, I tell you, an\nold rag not worth a farthing.”\n\n“And where did you get the needle and thread?”\n\n“I’ll stop now. I won’t say any more. Enough of it!” said Mitya, losing\nhis temper at last.\n\n“It’s strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you\nthrew the pieces in the market‐place.”",
            "10": "“Give orders for the market‐place to be swept to‐morrow, and perhaps\nyou’ll find it,” said Mitya, sneering. “Enough, gentlemen, enough!” he\ndecided, in an exhausted voice. “I see you don’t believe me! Not for a\nmoment! It’s my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready.\nWhy, why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you? It’s a\njoke to you. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it,\nprosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you\ntorturers!”\n\nHe bent his head, and hid his face in his hands. The lawyers were\nsilent. A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost\nvacantly. His face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he sat\nmute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening. In\nthe meantime they had to finish what they were about. They had\nimmediately to begin examining the witnesses. It was by now eight\no’clock in the morning. The lights had been extinguished long ago.\nMihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been continually in and out of\nthe room all the while the interrogation had been going on, had now\nboth gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very tired. It was a\nwretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed\ndown in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.\n\n“May I look out of the window?” he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch,\nsuddenly.\n\n“Oh, as much as you like,” the latter replied.\n\nMitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its\nlittle greenish panes. He could see the muddy road just below the\nhouse, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black,\ndismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the rain. Mitya thought\nof “Phœbus the golden‐haired,” and how he had meant to shoot himself at\nhis first ray. “Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like\nthis,” he thought with a smile, and suddenly, flinging his hand\ndownwards, he turned to his “torturers.”\n\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, “I see that I am lost! But she? Tell me about\nher, I beseech you. Surely she need not be ruined with me? She’s\ninnocent, you know, she was out of her mind when she cried last night\n‘It’s all my fault!’ She’s done nothing, nothing! I’ve been grieving\nover her all night as I sat with you.... Can’t you, won’t you tell me\nwhat you are going to do with her now?”",
            "11": "“You can set your mind quite at rest on that score, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch,” the prosecutor answered at once, with evident alacrity.\n“We have, so far, no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you\nare so interested. I trust that it may be the same in the later\ndevelopment of the case.... On the contrary, we’ll do everything that\nlies in our power in that matter. Set your mind completely at rest.”\n\n“Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you were honest, straight‐forward\npeople in spite of everything. You’ve taken a load off my heart....\nWell, what are we to do now? I’m ready.”\n\n“Well, we ought to make haste. We must pass to examining the witnesses\nwithout delay. That must be done in your presence and therefore—”\n\n“Shouldn’t we have some tea first?” interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch, “I\nthink we’ve deserved it!”\n\nThey decided that if tea were ready downstairs (Mihail Makarovitch had,\nno doubt, gone down to get some) they would have a glass and then “go\non and on,” putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable\nopportunity. Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up. Mitya\nat first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered\nhim, but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily. He\nlooked surprisingly exhausted. It might have been supposed from his\nHerculean strength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the\nmost violent emotions, could have had little effect on him. But he felt\nthat he could hardly hold his head up, and from time to time all the\nobjects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes. “A little\nmore and I shall begin raving,” he said to himself."

        "content": {
            "0": "The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our\nstory in such detail as before. And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay\nParfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his\nevidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he would\nafterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath, how every witness was\ncalled upon to sign the protocol of his evidence, and so on. We will\nonly note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination\nwas the question of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum\nspent here, at Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before,\nthree thousand or fifteen hundred? And again had he spent three\nthousand or fifteen hundred yesterday? Alas, all the evidence given by\nevery one turned out to be against Mitya. There was not one in his\nfavor, and some witnesses introduced new, almost crushing facts, in\ncontradiction of his, Mitya’s, story.\n\nThe first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch. He was not in the\nleast abashed as he stood before the lawyers. He had, on the contrary,\nan air of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him\nan appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity. He spoke little,\nand with reserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and\ndeliberately. Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum\nspent a month before could not have been less than three thousand, that\nall the peasants about here would testify that they had heard the sum\nof three thousand mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself. “What a lot\nof money he flung away on the gypsy girls alone! He wasted a thousand,\nI daresay, on them alone.”\n\n“I don’t believe I gave them five hundred,” was Mitya’s gloomy comment\non this. “It’s a pity I didn’t count the money at the time, but I was\ndrunk....”\n\nMitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains. He listened\ngloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he would say:\n\n“Oh, say what you like. It makes no difference now.”",
            "1": "“More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” retorted\nTrifon Borissovitch firmly. “You flung it about at random and they\npicked it up. They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse‐stealers,\nthey’ve been driven away from here, or maybe they’d bear witness\nthemselves how much they got from you. I saw the sum in your hands,\nmyself—count it I didn’t, you didn’t let me, that’s true enough—but by\nthe look of it I should say it was far more than fifteen hundred ...\nfifteen hundred, indeed! We’ve seen money too. We can judge of\namounts....”\n\nAs for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had\ntold him, as soon as he arrived, that he had brought three thousand\nwith him.\n\n“Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch?” replied Mitya. “Surely I\ndidn’t declare so positively that I’d brought three thousand?”\n\n“You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andrey\nhimself is still here. Send for him. And in the hall, when you were\ntreating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave your\nsixth thousand here—that is with what you spent before, we must\nunderstand. Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov,\ntoo, was standing beside you at the time. Maybe he’d remember it....”\n\nThe evidence as to the “sixth” thousand made an extraordinary\nimpression on the two lawyers. They were delighted with this new mode\nof reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then and three\nnow made six, that was clear.\n\nThey questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch,\nStepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov. The peasants and\nthe driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch’s evidence.\nThey noted down, with particular care, Andrey’s account of the\nconversation he had had with Mitya on the road: “ ‘Where,’ says he, ‘am\nI, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to heaven or to hell, and shall I be\nforgiven in the next world or not?’ ”\n\nThe psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile,\nand ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri\nFyodorovitch would go should be “included in the case.”",
            "2": "Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill‐humored,\nand he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in\nhis life, though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every\nday for a long time past. He began by saying that “he knew nothing\nabout it and didn’t want to.” But it appeared that he had heard of the\n“sixth” thousand, and he admitted that he had been standing close by at\nthe moment. As far as he could see he “didn’t know” how much money\nMitya had in his hands. He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at\ncards. In reply to reiterated questions he stated that, after the Poles\nhad been turned out, Mitya’s position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had\ncertainly improved, and that she had said that she loved him. He spoke\nof Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she had\nbeen a lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself to call\nher Grushenka. In spite of the young man’s obvious repugnance at giving\nevidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great length, and only\nfrom him learnt all the details of what made up Mitya’s “romance,” so\nto say, on that night. Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last\nthey let the young man go, and he left the room with unconcealed\nindignation.",
            "3": "The Poles, too, were examined. Though they had gone to bed in their\nroom, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police\nofficers they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would\ncertainly be sent for. They gave their evidence with dignity, though\nnot without some uneasiness. The little Pole turned out to be a retired\nofficial of the twelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a\nveterinary surgeon. His name was Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned\nout to be an uncertificated dentist. Although Nikolay Parfenovitch\nasked them questions on entering the room they both addressed their\nanswers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was standing on one side, taking him\nin their ignorance for the most important person and in command, and\naddressed him at every word as “Pan Colonel.” Only after several\nreproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they grasped that they had to\naddress their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only. It turned out that\nthey could speak Russian quite correctly except for their accent in\nsome words. Of his relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan\nMussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at\nonce and declared that he would not allow the “scoundrel” to speak like\nthat in his presence! Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the\nword “scoundrel” and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.\nMitya fumed with rage.\n\n“He’s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down,\ntoo, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he’s a\nscoundrel!” he cried.",
            "4": "Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he showed\nthe most praiseworthy tact and management. After sternly reprimanding\nMitya, he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the\ncase, and hastened to pass to what was essential. One piece of evidence\ngiven by the Poles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was\nhow, in that very room, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch,\nand had offered him three thousand roubles to resign his claims, seven\nhundred roubles down, and the remaining two thousand three hundred “to\nbe paid next day in the town.” He had sworn at the time that he had not\nthe whole sum with him at Mokroe, but that his money was in the town.\nMitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay\nhim the remainder next day in the town. But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed\nthe statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment admitted,\nfrowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated, that he had been\nexcited at the time, and might indeed have said so.\n\nThe prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. It seemed\nto establish for the prosecution (and they did, in fact, base this\ndeduction on it) that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had\ncome into Mitya’s hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in\nthe town, or even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe. This would\nexplain the circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only\neight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya’s hands. This\ncircumstance had been the one piece of evidence which, insignificant as\nit was, had hitherto told, to some extent, in Mitya’s favor. Now this\none piece of evidence in his favor had broken down. In answer to the\nprosecutor’s inquiry, where he would have got the remaining two\nthousand three hundred roubles, since he himself had denied having more\nthan fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently replied that he had meant to\noffer the “little chap,” not money, but a formal deed of conveyance of\nhis rights to the village of Tchermashnya, those rights which he had\nalready offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov. The prosecutor\npositively smiled at the “innocence of this subterfuge.”\n\n“And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for\ntwo thousand three hundred roubles in cash?”",
            "5": "“He certainly would have accepted it,” Mitya declared warmly. “Why,\nlook here, he might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for\nit. He would have put his lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and\nmight have got, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the\nold man.”\n\nThe evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the\nprotocol in the fullest detail. Then they let the Poles go. The\nincident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. Nikolay\nParfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not\nwant to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a\nfoolish, drunken quarrel over cards. There had been drinking and\ndisorder enough, that night.... So the two hundred roubles remained in\nthe pockets of the Poles.\n\nThen old Maximov was summoned. He came in timidly, approached with\nlittle steps, looking very disheveled and depressed. He had, all this\ntime, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her, and\n“now and then he’d begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a\nblue check handkerchief,” as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards.\nSo that she herself began trying to pacify and comfort him. The old man\nat once confessed that he had done wrong, that he had borrowed “ten\nroubles in my poverty,” from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he was ready\nto pay it back. To Nikolay Parfenovitch’s direct question, had he\nnoticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand, as he must\nhave been able to see the sum better than any one when he took the note\nfrom him, Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there was\ntwenty thousand.\n\n“Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?” inquired\nNikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile.\n\n“To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my\nlittle property. She’d only let me look at it from a distance, boasting\nof it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow‐colored notes. And\nDmitri Fyodorovitch’s were all rainbow‐colored....”",
            "6": "He was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka’s turn. Nikolay\nParfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance\nmight have on Mitya, and he muttered a few words of admonition to him,\nbut Mitya bowed his head in silence, giving him to understand “that he\nwould not make a scene.” Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in.\nShe entered with a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed\nand sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch.\nShe was very pale, she seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely\nin her magnificent black shawl. She was suffering from a slight\nfeverish chill—the first symptom of the long illness which followed\nthat night. Her grave air, her direct earnest look and quiet manner\nmade a very favorable impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was\neven a little bit “fascinated.” He admitted himself, when talking about\nit afterwards, that only then had he seen “how handsome the woman was,”\nfor, though he had seen her several times before, he had always looked\nupon her as something of a “provincial hetaira.” “She has the manners\nof the best society,” he said enthusiastically, gossiping about her in\na circle of ladies. But this was received with positive indignation by\nthe ladies, who immediately called him a “naughty man,” to his great\nsatisfaction.\n\nAs she entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at\nMitya, who looked at her uneasily. But her face reassured him at once.\nAfter the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch\nasked her, hesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous\nmanner, on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri\nFyodorovitch Karamazov. To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied:",
            "7": "“He was an acquaintance. He came to see me as an acquaintance during\nthe last month.” To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly\nand with complete frankness, that, though “at times” she had thought\nhim attractive, she had not loved him, but had won his heart as well as\nhis old father’s “in my nasty spite,” that she had seen that Mitya was\nvery jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only\namused her. She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she had\nsimply been laughing at him. “I had no thoughts for either of them all\nthis last month. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I\nthink,” she said in conclusion, “that there’s no need for you to\ninquire about that, nor for me to answer you, for that’s my own\naffair.”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again\ndismissed the “romantic” aspect of the case and passed to the serious\none, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning the three\nthousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand\nroubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and,\nthough she had not counted the money herself, she had heard that it was\nthree thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch’s own lips.\n\n“Did he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only\nhear him speak of it to others in your presence?” the prosecutor\ninquired immediately.\n\nTo which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other\npeople, and had heard him say so when they were alone.\n\n“Did he say it to you alone once, or several times?” inquired the\nprosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of\nevidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where\nthat money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from\nKaterina Ivanovna.\n\n“And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not\nthree thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half\nthat sum for his own use?”\n\n“No, I never heard that,” answered Grushenka.\n\nIt was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told\nher that he hadn’t a farthing.\n\n“He was always expecting to get some from his father,” said Grushenka\nin conclusion.\n\n“Did he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of\nirritation,” Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, “that he intended to\nmake an attempt on his father’s life?”\n\n“Ach, he did say so,” sighed Grushenka.",
            "8": "“Once or several times?”\n\n“He mentioned it several times, always in anger.”\n\n“And did you believe he would do it?”\n\n“No, I never believed it,” she answered firmly. “I had faith in his\nnoble heart.”\n\n“Gentlemen, allow me,” cried Mitya suddenly, “allow me to say one word\nto Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.”\n\n“You can speak,” Nikolay Parfenovitch assented.\n\n“Agrafena Alexandrovna!” Mitya got up from his chair, “have faith in\nGod and in me. I am not guilty of my father’s murder!”\n\nHaving uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair. Grushenka\nstood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. “Thanks be to\nThee, O Lord,” she said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still\nstanding, she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added:\n\n“As he has spoken now, believe it! I know him. He’ll say anything as a\njoke or from obstinacy, but he’ll never deceive you against his\nconscience. He’s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.”\n\n“Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you’ve given me fresh courage,” Mitya\nresponded in a quivering voice.\n\nAs to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not\nknow what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had\nthree thousand with him. And to the question where he got the money,\nshe said that he had told her that he had “stolen” it from Katerina\nIvanovna, and that she had replied to that that he hadn’t stolen it,\nand that he must pay the money back next day. On the prosecutor’s\nasking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from\nKaterina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday, or what he had\nsquandered here a month ago, she declared that he meant the money spent\na month ago, and that that was how she understood him.\n\nGrushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her\nimpulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he\ncould be of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she\nwould care for an escort, he ... would be—\n\n“I thank you sincerely,” said Grushenka, bowing to him, “I’m going with\nthis old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and\nmeanwhile, if you’ll allow me, I’ll wait below to hear what you decide\nabout Dmitri Fyodorovitch.”",
            "9": "She went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only\nfor a moment. He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical\nweakness. His eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the\nwitnesses was, at last, over. They proceeded to a final revision of the\nprotocol. Mitya got up, moved from his chair to the corner by the\ncurtain, lay down on a large chest covered with a rug, and instantly\nfell asleep.\n\nHe had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the\ntime.\n\nHe was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed\nlong ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of\nhorses, through snow and sleet. He was cold, it was early in November,\nand the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it\ntouched the earth. And the peasant drove him smartly, he had a fair,\nlong beard. He was not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he had on\na gray peasant’s smock. Not far off was a village, he could see the\nblack huts, and half the huts were burnt down, there were only the\ncharred beams sticking up. And as they drove in, there were peasant\nwomen drawn up along the road, a lot of women, a whole row, all thin\nand wan, with their faces a sort of brownish color, especially one at\nthe edge, a tall, bony woman, who looked forty, but might have been\nonly twenty, with a long thin face. And in her arms was a little baby\ncrying. And her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of\nmilk in them. And the child cried and cried, and held out its little\nbare arms, with its little fists blue from cold.\n\n“Why are they crying? Why are they crying?” Mitya asked, as they dashed\ngayly by.\n\n“It’s the babe,” answered the driver, “the babe weeping.”\n\nAnd Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, “the babe,” and\nhe liked the peasant’s calling it a “babe.” There seemed more pity in\nit.\n\n“But why is it weeping?” Mitya persisted stupidly, “why are its little\narms bare? Why don’t they wrap it up?”\n\n“The babe’s cold, its little clothes are frozen and don’t warm it.”\n\n“But why is it? Why?” foolish Mitya still persisted.\n\n“Why, they’re poor people, burnt out. They’ve no bread. They’re begging\nbecause they’ve been burnt out.”",
            "10": "“No, no,” Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. “Tell me why it\nis those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe\npoor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don’t they hug each other and kiss?\nWhy don’t they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black\nmisery? Why don’t they feed the babe?”\n\nAnd he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,\nyet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way.\nAnd he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before,\nwas rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do\nsomething for them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that\nthe dark‐ faced, dried‐up mother should not weep, that no one should\nshed tears again from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at\nonce, regardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the\nKaramazovs.\n\n“And I’m coming with you. I won’t leave you now for the rest of my\nlife, I’m coming with you,” he heard close beside him Grushenka’s\ntender voice, thrilling with emotion. And his heart glowed, and he\nstruggled forward towards the light, and he longed to live, to live, to\ngo on and on, towards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten,\nnow, at once!\n\n“What! Where?” he exclaimed opening his eyes, and sitting up on the\nchest, as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay\nParfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the\nprotocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep\nan hour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was\nsuddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head,\nwhich hadn’t been there when he had leant back, exhausted, on the\nchest.\n\n“Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?” he cried, with a\nsort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some\ngreat kindness had been shown him.\n\nHe never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant\nwitnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch’s little secretary, had\ncompassionately thought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole\nsoul was quivering with tears. He went to the table and said that he\nwould sign whatever they liked.\n\n“I’ve had a good dream, gentlemen,” he said in a strange voice, with a\nnew light, as of joy, in his face."

Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged\nhis shoulders.\n\n“Well, gentlemen, I don’t blame you. I’m ready.... I understand that\nthere’s nothing else for you to do.”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at\nonce by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened\nto be on the spot....\n\n“Stay,” Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable\nfeeling he pronounced, addressing all in the room:",
            "1": "“Gentlemen, we’re all cruel, we’re all monsters, we all make men weep,\nand mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled\nhere, now, of all I am the lowest reptile! I’ve sworn to amend, and\nevery day I’ve done the same filthy things. I understand now that such\nmen as I need a blow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose,\nand bind them by a force from without. Never, never should I have risen\nof myself! But the thunderbolt has fallen. I accept the torture of\naccusation, and my public shame, I want to suffer and by suffering I\nshall be purified. Perhaps I shall be purified, gentlemen? But listen,\nfor the last time, I am not guilty of my father’s blood. I accept my\npunishment, not because I killed him, but because I meant to kill him,\nand perhaps I really might have killed him. Still I mean to fight it\nout with you. I warn you of that. I’ll fight it out with you to the\nend, and then God will decide. Good‐by, gentlemen, don’t be vexed with\nme for having shouted at you during the examination. Oh, I was still\nsuch a fool then.... In another minute I shall be a prisoner, but now,\nfor the last time, as a free man, Dmitri Karamazov offers you his hand.\nSaying good‐by to you, I say it to all men.”\n\nHis voice quivered and he stretched out his hand, but Nikolay\nParfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him, with a sudden,\nalmost nervous movement, hid his hands behind his back. Mitya instantly\nnoticed this, and started. He let his outstretched hand fall at once.\n\n“The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,” Nikolay Parfenovitch\nfaltered, somewhat embarrassed. “We will continue it in the town, and\nI, for my part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your\ndefense.... As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I’ve always been\ndisposed to regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty.\nAll of us here, if I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready\nto recognize that you are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas,\none who has been carried away by certain passions to a somewhat\nexcessive degree....”\n\nNikolay Parfenovitch’s little figure was positively majestic by the\ntime he had finished speaking. It struck Mitya that in another minute\nthis “boy” would take his arm, lead him to another corner, and renew\ntheir conversation about “girls.” But many quite irrelevant and\ninappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is\nbeing led out to execution.",
            "2": "“Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _her_ to say\n‘good‐by’ for the last time?” asked Mitya.\n\n“Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it’s impossible except in\nthe presence of—”\n\n“Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!”\n\nGrushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words,\nand did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch. Grushenka made a deep\nbow to Mitya.\n\n“I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours. I will follow you for\never, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though\nyou’ve been your own undoing.”\n\nHer lips quivered, tears flowed from her eyes.\n\n“Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.”\n\nMitya would have said something more, but he broke off and went out. He\nwas at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him. At the\nbottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day\nbefore with Andrey’s three horses, two carts stood in readiness.\nMavriky Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick‐set man with a wrinkled face,\nwas annoyed about something, some sudden irregularity. He was shouting\nangrily. He asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive\nsurliness.\n\n“When I stood him drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a different\nface,” thought Mitya, as he got in. At the gates there was a crowd of\npeople, peasants, women and drivers. Trifon Borissovitch came down the\nsteps too. All stared at Mitya.\n\n“Forgive me at parting, good people!” Mitya shouted suddenly from the\ncart.\n\n“Forgive us too!” he heard two or three voices.\n\n“Good‐by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch!”\n\nBut Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round. He was, perhaps, too\nbusy. He, too, was shouting and fussing about something. It appeared\nthat everything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two\nconstables were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. The peasant who had\nbeen ordered to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock, stoutly\nmaintaining that it was not his turn to go, but Akim’s. But Akim was\nnot to be seen. They ran to look for him. The peasant persisted and\nbesought them to wait.\n\n“You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They’ve no\nshame!” exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch. “Akim gave you twenty‐five\ncopecks the day before yesterday. You’ve drunk it all and now you cry\nout. I’m simply surprised at your good‐nature, with our low peasants,\nMavriky Mavrikyevitch, that’s all I can say.”",
            "3": "“But what do we want a second cart for?” Mitya put in. “Let’s start\nwith the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. I won’t be unruly, I won’t run\naway from you, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?”\n\n“I’ll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you’ve never\nbeen taught. I’m not ‘old fellow’ to you, and you can keep your advice\nfor another time!” Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as\nthough glad to vent his wrath.\n\nMitya was reduced to silence. He flushed all over. A moment later he\nfelt suddenly very cold. The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was\nstill overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his\nface.\n\n“I’ve taken a chill,” thought Mitya, twitching his shoulders.\n\nAt last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down\nheavily, and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the\ncorner. It is true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the\ntask that had been laid upon him.\n\n“Good‐by, Trifon Borissovitch!” Mitya shouted again, and felt himself,\nthat he had not called out this time from good‐nature, but\ninvoluntarily, from resentment.\n\nBut Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his back,\nand staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he made no\nreply.\n\n“Good‐by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good‐by!” he heard all at once the voice\nof Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he\nheld out his hand to Mitya. He had no cap on.\n\nMitya had time to seize and press his hand.\n\n“Good‐by, dear fellow! I shan’t forget your generosity,” he cried\nwarmly.\n\nBut the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and\nMitya was driven off.\n\nKalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face in\nhis hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that,\ncrying as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty.\nOh, he believed almost without doubt in Mitya’s guilt.\n\n“What are these people? What can men be after this?” he exclaimed\nincoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that moment he\nhad no desire to live.\n\n“Is it worth it? Is it worth it?” exclaimed the boy in his grief.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\n\n\nBook X. The Boys"

            "0": "It was the beginning of November. There had been a hard frost, eleven\ndegrees Réaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the\nfrozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and\nblowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the\nmarket‐place. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased.\n\nNot far from the market‐place, close to Plotnikov’s shop, there stood a\nsmall house, very clean both without and within. It belonged to Madame\nKrassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been\ndead for fourteen years. His widow, still a nice‐looking woman of\nthirty‐two, was living in her neat little house on her private means.\nShe lived in respectable seclusion; she was of a soft but fairly\ncheerful disposition. She was about eighteen at the time of her\nhusband’s death; she had been married only a year and had just borne\nhim a son. From the day of his death she had devoted herself heart and\nsoul to the bringing up of her precious treasure, her boy Kolya. Though\nshe had loved him passionately those fourteen years, he had caused her\nfar more suffering than happiness. She had been trembling and fainting\nwith terror almost every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch\ncold, do something naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on\nand so on. When Kolya began going to school, the mother devoted herself\nto studying all the sciences with him so as to help him, and go through\nhis lessons with him. She hastened to make the acquaintance of the\nteachers and their wives, even made up to Kolya’s schoolfellows, and\nfawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being teased,\nlaughed at, or beaten by them. She went so far that the boys actually\nbegan to mock at him on her account and taunt him with being a\n“mother’s darling.”",
            "1": "But the boy could take his own part. He was a resolute boy,\n“tremendously strong,” as was rumored in his class, and soon proved to\nbe the fact; he was agile, strong‐willed, and of an audacious and\nenterprising temper. He was good at lessons, and there was a rumor in\nthe school that he could beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic\nand universal history. Though he looked down upon every one, he was a\ngood comrade and not supercilious. He accepted his schoolfellows’\nrespect as his due, but was friendly with them. Above all, he knew\nwhere to draw the line. He could restrain himself on occasion, and in\nhis relations with the teachers he never overstepped that last mystic\nlimit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of\ndiscipline. But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion\nas the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of\nmischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something\neffective and conspicuous. He was extremely vain. He knew how to make\neven his mother give way to him; he was almost despotic in his control\nof her. She gave way to him, oh, she had given way to him for years.\nThe one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love\nfor her. She was always fancying that Kolya was “unfeeling” to her, and\nat times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she used to reproach him\nwith his coldness. The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations\nof feeling were demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to\navoid them. Yet it was not intentional on his part but instinctive—it\nwas his character. His mother was mistaken; he was very fond of her. He\nonly disliked “sheepish sentimentality,” as he expressed it in his\nschoolboy language.\n\nThere was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been\nhis father’s. Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them\nby himself. His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at\nseeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book\ninstead of going to play. And in that way Kolya read some things\nunsuitable for his age.\n\nThough the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his mischief,\nhe had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious\nalarm. It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did, but a wild\nmad recklessness.",
            "2": "It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and\nson went to another district, forty‐five miles away, to spend a week\nwith a distant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway\nstation (the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a\nmonth later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow). There\nKolya began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the\nrailways, knowing that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got\nhome with his newly acquired knowledge. But there happened to be some\nother boys in the place with whom he soon made friends. Some of them\nwere living at the station, others in the neighborhood; there were six\nor seven of them, all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came\nfrom our town. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day\nof Kolya’s stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys.\nKolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down\nupon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or by reckless\nbravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the\nrails at night when the eleven o’clock train was due, and would lie\nthere without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed. It\nis true they made a preliminary investigation, from which it appeared\nthat it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train\ncould pass over without touching, but to lie there was no joke! Kolya\nmaintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at him, called\nhim a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on. What piqued\nhim most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him\ntoo superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as “a small\nboy,” not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable\ninsult.\n\nAnd so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the\nstation, so that the train might have time to get up full speed after\nleaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch‐dark night\nwithout a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails.\nThe five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the\nembankment, their hearts beating with suspense, which was followed by\nalarm and remorse. At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the\ntrain leaving the station. Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness;\nthe monster roared as it approached.",
            "3": "“Run, run away from the rails,” the boys cried to Kolya from the\nbushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted\nup and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They\nbegan pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked\naway without a word. Then he explained that he had lain there as though\nhe were insensible to frighten them, but the fact was that he really\nhad lost consciousness, as he confessed long after to his mother. In\nthis way his reputation as “a desperate character,” was established for\never. He returned home to the station as white as a sheet. Next day he\nhad a slight attack of nervous fever, but he was in high spirits and\nwell pleased with himself. The incident did not become known at once,\nbut when they came back to the town it penetrated to the school and\neven reached the ears of the masters. But then Kolya’s mother hastened\nto entreat the masters on her boy’s behalf, and in the end Dardanelov,\na respected and influential teacher, exerted himself in his favor, and\nthe affair was ignored.",
            "4": "Dardanelov was a middle‐aged bachelor, who had been passionately in\nlove with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already,\nabout a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy\nof his sentiments, to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage.\nBut she refused him resolutely, feeling that to accept him would be an\nact of treachery to her son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from\ncertain mysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he was not an\nobject of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender‐hearted\nwidow. Kolya’s mad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov\nwas rewarded for his intercession by a suggestion of hope. The\nsuggestion, it is true, was a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a\nparagon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to\nmake him perfectly happy. He was fond of the boy, though he would have\nfelt it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict\nwith him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance. He\nlearned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was reserved\nwith Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that Kolya was so\ngood at universal history that he could “beat” even Dardanelov. Kolya\ndid indeed ask him the question, “Who founded Troy?” to which\nDardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring to the movements and\nmigrations of races, to the remoteness of the period, to the mythical\nlegends. But the question, “Who had founded Troy?” that is, what\nindividuals, he could not answer, and even for some reason regarded the\nquestion as idle and frivolous. But the boys remained convinced that\nDardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of the\nfounders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in his\nfather’s bookcase. In the end all the boys became interested in the\nquestion, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not\ntell his secret, and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.",
            "5": "After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya’s\nattitude to his mother. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard\nof her son’s exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She\nhad such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for\nseveral days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his\nhonor that such pranks should never be repeated. He swore on his knees\nbefore the holy image, and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame\nKrassotkin’s instance, and the “manly” Kolya burst into tears like a\nboy of six. And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing\ninto each other’s arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as “unfeeling”\nas before, but he had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and\nmore thoughtful.",
            "6": "Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which even\nbrought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a\nscrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he did not, as it\nturned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.\nBut of this later. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more\nuneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. It must be\nnoted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov’s heart\nand, of course, despised him profoundly for his “feelings”; he had in\nthe past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother,\nhinting vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the\ntime of the railway incident his behavior in this respect also was\nchanged; he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject\nand began to speak more respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother,\nwhich the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude.\nBut at the slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya’s\npresence, she would flush as pink as a rose. At such moments Kolya\nwould either stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate the\nstate of his boots, or would shout angrily for “Perezvon,” the big,\nshaggy, mangy dog, which he had picked up a month before, brought home,\nand kept for some reason secretly indoors, not showing him to any of\nhis schoolfellows. He bullied him frightfully, teaching him all sorts\nof tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he was absent\nat school, and when he came in, whined with delight, rushed about as if\nhe were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground pretending to be dead,\nand so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he had taught him, not at the\nword of command, but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful\nheart.\n\nI have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the\nboy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as\nthe son of Captain Snegiryov. Ilusha had been defending his father when\nthe schoolboys jeered at him, shouting the nickname “wisp of tow.”"

            "0": "And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya\nKrassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school.\nIt had just struck eleven, and he particularly wanted to go out “on\nvery urgent business,” but he was left alone in charge of the house,\nfor it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a\nsudden and singular event. Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms,\nseparated from the rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor’s wife\nwith her two small children. This lady was the same age as Anna\nFyodorovna, and a great friend of hers. Her husband, the doctor, had\ntaken his departure twelve months before, going first to Orenburg and\nthen to Tashkend, and for the last six months she had not heard a word\nfrom him. Had it not been for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin,\nwhich was some consolation to the forsaken lady, she would certainly\nhave completely dissolved away in tears. And now, to add to her\nmisfortunes, Katerina, her only servant, was suddenly moved the evening\nbefore to announce, to her mistress’s amazement, that she proposed to\nbring a child into the world before morning. It seemed almost\nmiraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability of it\nbefore. The astounded doctor’s wife decided to move Katerina while\nthere was still time to an establishment in the town kept by a midwife\nfor such emergencies. As she set great store by her servant, she\npromptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her. By\nthe morning all Madame Krassotkin’s friendly sympathy and energy were\ncalled upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the\ncase.",
            "1": "So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins’ servant,\nAgafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time\nto protect and look after “the kids,” that is, the son and daughter of\nthe doctor’s wife, who were left alone. Kolya was not afraid of taking\ncare of the house, besides he had Perezvon, who had been told to lie\nflat, without moving, under the bench in the hall. Every time Kolya,\nwalking to and fro through the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook\nhis head and gave two loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his\ntail, but alas! the whistle did not sound to release him. Kolya looked\nsternly at the luckless dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity.\nThe one thing that troubled Kolya was “the kids.” He looked, of course,\nwith the utmost scorn on Katerina’s unexpected adventure, but he was\nvery fond of the bereaved “kiddies,” and had already taken them a\npicture‐book. Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and\nKostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her.\nKrassotkin could, of course, have provided more diverting entertainment\nfor them. He could have made them stand side by side and played\nsoldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the house. He had done\nso more than once before and was not above doing it, so much so that a\nreport once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses with the\nlittle lodgers at home, prancing with his head on one side like a\ntrace‐horse. But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out\nthat to play horses with boys of one’s own age, boys of thirteen, would\ncertainly be disgraceful “at this date,” but that he did it for the\nsake of “the kids” because he liked them, and no one had a right to\ncall him to account for his feelings. The two “kids” adored him.\n\nBut on this occasion he was in no mood for games. He had very important\nbusiness of his own before him, something almost mysterious. Meanwhile\ntime was passing and Agafya, with whom he could have left the children,\nwould not come back from market. He had several times already crossed\nthe passage, opened the door of the lodgers’ room and looked anxiously\nat “the kids” who were sitting over the book, as he had bidden them.\nEvery time he opened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come\nin and would do something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was\nbothered and did not go in.",
            "2": "At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if\nthat “damned” Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go\nout without waiting for her, making “the kids” promise, of course, to\nbe brave when he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright.\nWith this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin\nfur collar, slung his satchel round his shoulder, and, regardless of\nhis mother’s constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put\non goloshes in such cold weather, he looked at them contemptuously as\nhe crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on. Perezvon,\nseeing him in his outdoor clothes, began tapping nervously, yet\nvigorously, on the floor with his tail. Twitching all over, he even\nuttered a plaintive whine. But Kolya, seeing his dog’s passionate\nexcitement, decided that it was a breach of discipline, kept him for\nanother minute under the bench, and only when he had opened the door\ninto the passage, whistled for him. The dog leapt up like a mad\ncreature and rushed bounding before him rapturously.\n\nKolya opened the door to peep at “the kids.” They were both sitting as\nbefore at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something.\nThe children often argued together about various exciting problems of\nlife, and Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it. If Kostya\ndid not agree with her, he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin,\nand his verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them. This time\nthe “kids’” discussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he stood still\nin the passage to listen. The children saw he was listening and that\nmade them dispute with even greater energy.\n\n“I shall never, never believe,” Nastya prattled, “that the old women\nfind babies among the cabbages in the kitchen‐garden. It’s winter now\nand there are no cabbages, and so the old woman couldn’t have taken\nKaterina a daughter.”\n\nKolya whistled to himself.\n\n“Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who\nare married.”\n\nKostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly.\n\n“Nastya, how silly you are!” he said at last, firmly and calmly. “How\ncan Katerina have a baby when she isn’t married?”\n\nNastya was exasperated.\n\n“You know nothing about it,” she snapped irritably. “Perhaps she has a\nhusband, only he is in prison, so now she’s got a baby.”\n\n“But is her husband in prison?” the matter‐of‐fact Kostya inquired\ngravely.",
            "3": "“Or, I tell you what,” Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely\nrejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis. “She hasn’t a husband,\nyou are right there, but she wants to be married, and so she’s been\nthinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now\nshe’s got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.”\n\n“Well, perhaps so,” Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. “But you didn’t\nsay so before. So how could I tell?”\n\n“Come, kiddies,” said Kolya, stepping into the room. “You’re terrible\npeople, I see.”\n\n“And Perezvon with you!” grinned Kostya, and began snapping his fingers\nand calling Perezvon.\n\n“I am in a difficulty, kids,” Krassotkin began solemnly, “and you must\nhelp me. Agafya must have broken her leg, since she has not turned up\ntill now, that’s certain. I must go out. Will you let me go?”\n\nThe children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces\nshowed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was\nexpected of them.\n\n“You won’t be naughty while I am gone? You won’t climb on the cupboard\nand break your legs? You won’t be frightened alone and cry?”\n\nA look of profound despondency came into the children’s faces.\n\n“And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon\nwhich can be fired with real gunpowder.”\n\nThe children’s faces instantly brightened. “Show us the cannon,” said\nKostya, beaming all over.\n\nKrassotkin put his hand in his satchel, and pulling out a little bronze\ncannon stood it on the table.\n\n“Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it’s on wheels.” He rolled the\ntoy on along the table. “And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded\nwith shot and fired off.”\n\n“And it could kill any one?”\n\n“It can kill any one; you’ve only got to aim at anybody,” and\nKrassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot\nshould be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch‐hole, and told\nthem that it kicked when it was fired.\n\nThe children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck\ntheir imagination was that the cannon kicked.\n\n“And have you got any powder?” Nastya inquired.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Show us the powder, too,” she drawled with a smile of entreaty.\n\nKrassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask\ncontaining a little real gunpowder. He had some shot, too, in a screw\nof paper. He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the\npalm of his hand.\n\n“One has to be careful there’s no fire about, or it would blow up and\nkill us all,” Krassotkin warned them sensationally.",
            "4": "The children gazed at the powder with an awe‐stricken alarm that only\nintensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.\n\n“And does the shot burn?” he inquired.\n\n“No, it doesn’t.”\n\n“Give me a little shot,” he asked in an imploring voice.\n\n“I’ll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don’t show it to your\nmother till I come back, or she’ll be sure to think it’s gunpowder, and\nwill die of fright and give you a thrashing.”\n\n“Mother never does whip us,” Nastya observed at once.\n\n“I know, I only said it to finish the sentence. And don’t you ever\ndeceive your mother except just this once, until I come back. And so,\nkiddies, can I go out? You won’t be frightened and cry when I’m gone?”\n\n“We sha—all cry,” drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already.\n\n“We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,” Nastya chimed in with timid\nhaste.\n\n“Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years! There’s\nno help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don’t know\nhow long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!”\n\n“Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!” Kostya begged.\n\n“There’s no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon. _Ici_,\nPerezvon.” And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all\nhis tricks.\n\nHe was a rough‐haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of\nlilac‐ gray color. He was blind in his right eye, and his left ear was\ntorn. He whined and jumped, stood and walked on his hind legs, lay on\nhis back with his paws in the air, rigid as though he were dead. While\nthis last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame\nKrassotkin’s servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small‐pox,\nappeared in the doorway. She had come back from market and had a bag\nfull of provisions in her hand. Holding up the bag of provisions in her\nleft hand she stood still to watch the dog. Though Kolya had been so\nanxious for her return, he did not cut short the performance, and after\nkeeping Perezvon dead for the usual time, at last he whistled to him.\nThe dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done\nhis duty.\n\n“Only think, a dog!” Agafya observed sententiously.\n\n“Why are you late, female?” asked Krassotkin sternly.\n\n“Female, indeed! Go on with you, you brat.”\n\n“Brat?”",
            "5": "“Yes, a brat. What is it to you if I’m late; if I’m late, you may be\nsure I have good reason,” muttered Agafya, busying herself about the\nstove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice. She seemed\nquite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young\nmaster.\n\n“Listen, you frivolous young woman,” Krassotkin began, getting up from\nthe sofa, “can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and\nsomething else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in\nmy absence? I am going out.”\n\n“And what am I going to swear for?” laughed Agafya. “I shall look after\nthem without that.”\n\n“No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan’t go.”\n\n“Well, don’t then. What does it matter to me? It’s cold out; stay at\nhome.”\n\n“Kids,” Kolya turned to the children, “this woman will stay with you\ntill I come back or till your mother comes, for she ought to have been\nback long ago. She will give you some lunch, too. You’ll give them\nsomething, Agafya, won’t you?”\n\n“That I can do.”\n\n“Good‐by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. And you, granny,” he\nadded gravely, in an undertone, as he passed Agafya, “I hope you’ll\nspare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman’s\nnonsense about Katerina. _Ici_, Perezvon!”\n\n“Get along with you!” retorted Agafya, really angry this time.\n“Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that’s\nwhat you want!”"

            "0": "But Kolya did not hear her. At last he could go out. As he went out at\nthe gate he looked round him, shrugged up his shoulders, and saying “It\nis freezing,” went straight along the street and turned off to the\nright towards the market‐place. When he reached the last house but one\nbefore the market‐place he stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of\nhis pocket, and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal.\nHe had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy‐cheeked boy of\nabout eleven, wearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to\nmeet him. This was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class (two classes\nbelow Kolya Krassotkin), son of a well‐to‐do official. Apparently he\nwas forbidden by his parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well\nknown to be a desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping\nout on the sly. He was—if the reader has not forgotten—one of the group\nof boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha. He was the\none who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha.\n\n“I’ve been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,” said Smurov\nstolidly, and the boys strode towards the market‐place.\n\n“I am late,” answered Krassotkin. “I was detained by circumstances. You\nwon’t be thrashed for coming with me?”\n\n“Come, I say, I’m never thrashed! And you’ve got Perezvon with you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You’re taking him, too?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!”\n\n“That’s impossible. Zhutchka’s non‐existent. Zhutchka is lost in the\nmists of obscurity.”\n\n“Ah! couldn’t we do this?” Smurov suddenly stood still. “You see Ilusha\nsays that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky‐looking dog like\nPerezvon. Couldn’t you tell him this is Zhutchka, and he might believe\nyou?”\n\n“Boy, shun a lie, that’s one thing; even with a good object—that’s\nanother. Above all, I hope you’ve not told them anything about my\ncoming.”\n\n“Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you won’t comfort him with\nPerezvon,” said Smurov, with a sigh. “You know his father, the captain,\n‘the wisp of tow,’ told us that he was going to bring him a real\nmastiff pup, with a black nose, to‐day. He thinks that would comfort\nIlusha; but I doubt it.”\n\n“And how is Ilusha?”",
            "1": "“Ah, he is bad, very bad! I believe he’s in consumption: he is quite\nconscious, but his breathing! His breathing’s gone wrong. The other day\nhe asked to have his boots on to be led round the room. He tried to\nwalk, but he couldn’t stand. ‘Ah, I told you before, father,’ he said,\n‘that those boots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.’\nHe fancied it was his boots that made him stagger, but it was simply\nweakness, really. He won’t live another week. Herzenstube is looking\nafter him. Now they are rich again—they’ve got heaps of money.”\n\n“They are rogues.”\n\n“Who are rogues?”\n\n“Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively, and also, of\ncourse, individually. I don’t believe in medicine. It’s a useless\ninstitution. I mean to go into all that. But what’s that sentimentality\nyou’ve got up there? The whole class seems to be there every day.”\n\n“Not the whole class: it’s only ten of our fellows who go to see him\nevery day. There’s nothing in that.”\n\n“What I don’t understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov\nis taking in it. His brother’s going to be tried to‐morrow or next day\nfor such a crime, and yet he has so much time to spend on\nsentimentality with boys.”\n\n“There’s no sentimentality about it. You are going yourself now to make\nit up with Ilusha.”\n\n“Make it up with him? What an absurd expression! But I allow no one to\nanalyze my actions.”\n\n“And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He has no idea that you are\ncoming. Why was it, why was it you wouldn’t come all this time?” Smurov\ncried with sudden warmth.\n\n“My dear boy, that’s my business, not yours. I am going of myself\nbecause I choose to, but you’ve all been hauled there by Alexey\nKaramazov—there’s a difference, you know. And how do you know? I may\nnot be going to make it up at all. It’s a stupid expression.”\n\n“It’s not Karamazov at all; it’s not his doing. Our fellows began going\nthere of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And\nthere’s been nothing of that sort—no silliness. First one went, and\nthen another. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he\nwill simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha’s\ndying. And he seems so glad we’ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked\nafter you, that was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will\ngo out of his mind or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before.\nYou know he is a very decent man. We made a mistake then. It’s all the\nfault of that murderer who beat him then.”",
            "2": "“Karamazov’s a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his\nacquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.\nBesides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.”\n\nKolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov,\nof course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on\na level with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya’s saying\nthat he was “going of himself” to see Ilusha. He felt that there must\nbe some mystery in Kolya’s suddenly taking it into his head to go to\nhim that day. They crossed the market‐place, in which at that hour were\nmany loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls.\nThe market women were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in\ntheir booths. These Sunday markets were naïvely called “fairs” in the\ntown, and there were many such fairs in the year.\n\nPerezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one\nside, then the other. When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each\nother over according to the rules of canine etiquette.\n\n“I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,” said Kolya suddenly.\n“Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet? It\nseems to be a law of their nature.”\n\n“Yes; it’s a funny habit.”\n\n“No, it’s not funny; you are wrong there. There’s nothing funny in\nnature, however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices. If dogs\ncould reason and criticize us they’d be sure to find just as much that\nwould be funny to them, if not far more, in the social relations of\nmen, their masters—far more, indeed. I repeat that, because I am\nconvinced that there is far more foolishness among us. That’s Rakitin’s\nidea—a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist, Smurov.”\n\n“And what is a Socialist?” asked Smurov.\n\n“That’s when all are equal and all have property in common, there are\nno marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he likes best,\nand all the rest of it. You are not old enough to understand that yet.\nIt’s cold, though.”\n\n“Yes, twelve degrees of frost. Father looked at the thermometer just\nnow.”",
            "3": "“Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don’t feel\nso cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we\ndo now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of\ntwelve degrees, especially when there is not much snow. It’s because\npeople are not used to it. Everything is habit with men, everything\neven in their social and political relations. Habit is the great\nmotive‐power. What a funny‐looking peasant!”\n\nKolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good‐natured countenance in a\nlong sheepskin coat, who was standing by his wagon, clapping together\nhis hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them. His long\nfair beard was all white with frost.\n\n“That peasant’s beard’s frozen,” Kolya cried in a loud provocative\nvoice as he passed him.\n\n“Lots of people’s beards are frozen,” the peasant replied, calmly and\nsententiously.\n\n“Don’t provoke him,” observed Smurov.\n\n“It’s all right; he won’t be cross; he’s a nice fellow. Good‐by,\nMatvey.”\n\n“Good‐by.”\n\n“Is your name Matvey?”\n\n“Yes. Didn’t you know?”\n\n“No, I didn’t. It was a guess.”\n\n“You don’t say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You get whipped, I expect?”\n\n“Nothing to speak of—sometimes.”\n\n“Does it hurt?”\n\n“Well, yes, it does.”\n\n“Ech, what a life!” The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his\nheart.\n\n“Good‐by, Matvey.”\n\n“Good‐by. You are a nice chap, that you are.”\n\nThe boys went on.\n\n“That was a nice peasant,” Kolya observed to Smurov. “I like talking to\nthe peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.”\n\n“Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?” asked Smurov.\n\n“I had to say that to please him.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“You know, Smurov, I don’t like being asked the same thing twice. I\nlike people to understand at the first word. Some things can’t be\nexplained. According to a peasant’s notions, schoolboys are whipped,\nand must be whipped. What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped?\nAnd if I were to tell him we are not, he’d be disappointed. But you\ndon’t understand that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants.”\n\n“Only don’t tease them, please, or you’ll get into another scrape as\nyou did about that goose.”\n\n“So you’re afraid?”\n\n“Don’t laugh, Kolya. Of course I’m afraid. My father would be awfully\ncross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.”\n\n“Don’t be uneasy, nothing will happen this time. Hallo, Natasha!” he\nshouted to a market woman in one of the booths.",
            "4": "“Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,” the middle‐aged market\nwoman shouted at him.\n\n“I am so glad it’s Marya. Good‐by!”\n\n“Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!”\n\n“I’m in a hurry. I can’t stay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.”\nKolya waved his hand at her, as though she had attacked him and not he\nher.\n\n“I’ve nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent\nyoung monkey. I didn’t say anything,” bawled Marya. “You want a\nwhipping, that’s what you want, you saucy jackanapes!”\n\nThere was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her.\nSuddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops\nclose by. He was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark,\ncurly hair and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox. He wore a long\nblue coat and a peaked cap, and looked like a merchant’s clerk. He was\nin a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya.\n\n“I know you!” he cried angrily, “I know you!”\n\nKolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row\nwith the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he\ncould hardly remember them all.\n\n“Do you?” he asked sarcastically.\n\n“I know you! I know you!” the man repeated idiotically.\n\n“So much the better for you. Well, it’s time I was going. Good‐by!”\n\n“You are at your saucy pranks again?” cried the man. “You are at your\nsaucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!”\n\n“It’s not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,”\nsaid Kolya, standing still and scanning him.\n\n“Not my business?”\n\n“No; it’s not your business.”\n\n“Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?”\n\n“It’s Trifon Nikititch’s business, not yours.”\n\n“What Trifon Nikititch?” asked the youth, staring with loutish\namazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever.\n\nKolya scanned him gravely.\n\n“Have you been to the Church of the Ascension?” he suddenly asked him,\nwith stern emphasis.\n\n“What Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven’t,” said the young\nman, somewhat taken aback.\n\n“Do you know Sabaneyev?” Kolya went on even more emphatically and even\nmore severely.\n\n“What Sabaneyev? No, I don’t know him.”\n\n“Well then you can go to the devil,” said Kolya, cutting short the\nconversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his\nway as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not\neven know Sabaneyev.",
            "5": "“Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev?” the young man recovered from his\nmomentary stupefaction and was as excited as before. “What did he say?”\nHe turned to the market women with a silly stare.\n\nThe women laughed.\n\n“You can never tell what he’s after,” said one of them.\n\n“What Sabaneyev is it he’s talking about?” the young man repeated,\nstill furious and brandishing his right arm.\n\n“It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that’s who it\nmust be,” one of the women suggested.\n\nThe young man stared at her wildly.\n\n“For the Kuzmitchovs?” repeated another woman. “But his name wasn’t\nTrifon. His name’s Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon\nNikititch, so it can’t be the same.”\n\n“His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it’s Tchizhov,” put in\nsuddenly a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening\ngravely. “Alexey Ivanitch is his name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch.”\n\n“Not a doubt about it, it’s Tchizhov,” a fourth woman emphatically\nconfirmed the statement.\n\nThe bewildered youth gazed from one to another.\n\n“But what did he ask for, what did he ask for, good people?” he cried\nalmost in desperation. “ ‘Do you know Sabaneyev?’ says he. And who the\ndevil’s to know who is Sabaneyev?”\n\n“You’re a senseless fellow. I tell you it’s not Sabaneyev, but\nTchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that’s who it is!” one of the women\nshouted at him impressively.\n\n“What Tchizhov? Who is he? Tell me, if you know.”\n\n“That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the\nsummer.”\n\n“And what’s your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?”\n\n“How can I tell what he’s to do with you?” put in another. “You ought\nto know yourself what you want with him, if you make such a clamor\nabout him. He spoke to you, he did not speak to us, you stupid. Don’t\nyou really know him?”\n\n“Know whom?”\n\n“Tchizhov.”\n\n“The devil take Tchizhov and you with him. I’ll give him a hiding, that\nI will. He was laughing at me!”\n\n“Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he will give you one. You are\na fool, that’s what you are!”\n\n“Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman. I’ll give\nthe boy a hiding. Catch him, catch him, he was laughing at me!”\n\nThe woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along\nwith a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, looking round at the\nshouting group far behind. He too was in high spirits, though he was\nstill afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya’s company.\n\n“What Sabaneyev did you mean?” he asked Kolya, foreseeing what his\nanswer would be.",
            "6": "“How do I know? Now there’ll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to\nstir up fools in every class of society. There’s another blockhead,\nthat peasant there. You know, they say ‘there’s no one stupider than a\nstupid Frenchman,’ but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as\nmuch. Can’t you see it all over his face that he is a fool, that\npeasant, eh?”\n\n“Let him alone, Kolya. Let’s go on.”\n\n“Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!”\n\nA sturdy‐looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard,\nwho was walking by, raised his head and looked at the boy. He seemed\nnot quite sober.\n\n“Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,” he said deliberately in\nreply.\n\n“And if I am?” laughed Kolya.\n\n“Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I don’t mind. There’s no harm in a\njoke.”\n\n“I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.”\n\n“Well, God forgive you!”\n\n“Do you forgive me, too?”\n\n“I quite forgive you. Go along.”\n\n“I say, you seem a clever peasant.”\n\n“Cleverer than you,” the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same\ngravity.\n\n“I doubt it,” said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.\n\n“It’s true, though.”\n\n“Perhaps it is.”\n\n“It is, brother.”\n\n“Good‐by, peasant!”\n\n“Good‐by!”\n\n“There are all sorts of peasants,” Kolya observed to Smurov after a\nbrief silence. “How could I tell I had hit on a clever one? I am always\nready to recognize intelligence in the peasantry.”\n\nIn the distance the cathedral clock struck half‐past eleven. The boys\nmade haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov’s lodging, a\nconsiderable distance, quickly and almost in silence. Twenty paces from\nthe house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask\nKaramazov to come out to him.\n\n“One must sniff round a bit first,” he observed to Smurov.\n\n“Why ask him to come out?” Smurov protested. “You go in; they will be\nawfully glad to see you. What’s the sense of making friends in the\nfrost out here?”\n\n“I know why I want to see him out here in the frost,” Kolya cut him\nshort in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with “small boys,”\nand Smurov ran to do his bidding."

            "0": "Kolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for\nAlyosha to appear. Yes, he had long wanted to meet him. He had heard a\ngreat deal about him from the boys, but hitherto he had always\nmaintained an appearance of disdainful indifference when he was\nmentioned, and he had even “criticized” what he heard about Alyosha.\nBut secretly he had a great longing to make his acquaintance; there was\nsomething sympathetic and attractive in all he was told about Alyosha.\nSo the present moment was important: to begin with, he had to show\nhimself at his best, to show his independence, “Or he’ll think of me as\nthirteen and take me for a boy, like the rest of them. And what are\nthese boys to him? I shall ask him when I get to know him. It’s a pity\nI am so short, though. Tuzikov is younger than I am, yet he is half a\nhead taller. But I have a clever face. I am not good‐looking. I know\nI’m hideous, but I’ve a clever face. I mustn’t talk too freely; if I\nfall into his arms all at once, he may think—Tfoo! how horrible if he\nshould think—!”\n\nSuch were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost\nto assume the most independent air. What distressed him most was his\nbeing so short; he did not mind so much his “hideous” face, as being so\nshort. On the wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a\npencil‐mark to show his height, and every two months since he anxiously\nmeasured himself against it to see how much he had gained. But alas! he\ngrew very slowly, and this sometimes reduced him almost to despair. His\nface was in reality by no means “hideous”; on the contrary, it was\nrather attractive, with a fair, pale skin, freckled. His small, lively\ngray eyes had a fearless look, and often glowed with feeling. He had\nrather high cheekbones; small, very red, but not very thick, lips; his\nnose was small and unmistakably turned up. “I’ve a regular pug nose, a\nregular pug nose,” Kolya used to mutter to himself when he looked in\nthe looking‐glass, and he always left it with indignation. “But perhaps\nI haven’t got a clever face?” he sometimes thought, doubtful even of\nthat. But it must not be supposed that his mind was preoccupied with\nhis face and his height. On the contrary, however bitter the moments\nbefore the looking‐glass were to him, he quickly forgot them, and\nforgot them for a long time, “abandoning himself entirely to ideas and\nto real life,” as he formulated it to himself.",
            "1": "Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he reached\nhim, Kolya could see that he looked delighted. “Can he be so glad to\nsee me?” Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing,\nthat Alyosha’s appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw\nhim last. He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well‐cut\ncoat, a soft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this\nwas very becoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His charming\nface always had a good‐humored expression; but there was a gentleness\nand serenity in his good‐humor. To Kolya’s surprise, Alyosha came out\nto him just as he was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in\nhaste. He held out his hand to Kolya at once.\n\n“Here you are at last! How anxious we’ve been to see you!”\n\n“There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to\nmake your acquaintance. I’ve long been hoping for an opportunity, and\nhave heard a great deal about you,” Kolya muttered, a little\nbreathless.\n\n“We should have met anyway. I’ve heard a great deal about you, too; but\nyou’ve been a long time coming here.”\n\n“Tell me, how are things going?”\n\n“Ilusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.”\n\n“How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,” cried\nKolya warmly.\n\n“Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, in\ndelirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to\nhim ... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then there’s another\nreason.... Tell me, is that your dog?”\n\n“Yes, Perezvon.”\n\n“Not Zhutchka?” Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. “Is she\nlost for ever?”",
            "2": "“I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I’ve heard all about it.”\nKolya smiled mysteriously. “Listen, Karamazov, I’ll tell you all about\nit. That’s what I came for; that’s what I asked you to come out here\nfor, to explain the whole episode to you before we go in,” he began\nwith animation. “You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory\nclass last spring. Well, you know what our preparatory class is—a lot\nof small boys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes\nhigher up, and, of course, I only look on at them from a distance. I\nsaw the boy was weak and small, but he wouldn’t give in to them; he\nfought with them. I saw he was proud, and his eyes were full of fire. I\nlike children like that. And they teased him all the more. The worst of\nit was he was horribly dressed at the time, his breeches were too small\nfor him, and there were holes in his boots. They worried him about it;\nthey jeered at him. That I can’t stand. I stood up for him at once, and\ngave it to them hot. I beat them, but they adore me, do you know,\nKaramazov?” Kolya boasted impulsively; “but I am always fond of\nchildren. I’ve two chickens in my hands at home now—that’s what\ndetained me to‐day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I took him\nunder my protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that, the boy\nwas proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he did my\nslightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copy me. In\nthe intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once, and I’d\ngo about with him. On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an older boy\nmakes friends with a younger one like that; but that’s a prejudice. If\nit’s my fancy, that’s enough. I am teaching him, developing him. Why\nshouldn’t I develop him if I like him? Here you, Karamazov, have taken\nup with all these nestlings. I see you want to influence the younger\ngeneration—to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you this\ntrait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more\nthan anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there\nwas a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you\nknow I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I\nhave had it from a baby. There were contradictions in him, too: he was\nproud, but he was slavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his eyes\nwould flash and he’d refuse to agree with me; he’d argue, fly into a\nrage. I used sometimes to propound certain ideas; I could see that it\nwas not so much that he disagreed with the ideas, but that he was\nsimply rebelling against me, because I was cool in responding to his\nendearments. And so, in order to train him properly, the tenderer he\nwas, the colder I became. I did it on purpose: that was my idea. My\nobject was to form his character, to lick him into shape, to make a man\nof him ... and besides ... no doubt, you understand me at a word.\nSuddenly I noticed for three days in succession he was downcast and\ndejected, not because of my coldness, but for something else, something\nmore important. I wondered what the tragedy was. I have pumped him and\nfound out that he had somehow got to know Smerdyakov, who was footman\nto your late father—it was before his death, of course—and he taught\nthe little fool a silly trick—that is, a brutal, nasty trick. He told\nhim to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it, and throw it to one\nof those hungry dogs who snap up anything without biting it, and then\nto watch and see what would happen. So they prepared a piece of bread\nlike that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there’s been such a\nfuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never fed it at all,\nthough it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid barking, Karamazov?\nI can’t stand it.) So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, and began\nto squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as it ran\nout of sight. That was Ilusha’s own account of it. He confessed it to\nme, and cried bitterly. He hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on\nrepeating ‘He ran away squealing’: the sight of that haunted him. He\nwas tormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I\ndetermined to give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must\nconfess I wasn’t quite straightforward, and pretended to be more\nindignant perhaps than I was. ‘You’ve done a nasty thing,’ I said, ‘you\nare a scoundrel. I won’t tell of it, of course, but I shall have\nnothing more to do with you for a time. I’ll think it over and let you\nknow through Smurov’—that’s the boy who’s just come with me; he’s\nalways ready to do anything for me—‘whether I will have anything to do\nwith you in the future or whether I give you up for good as a\nscoundrel.’ He was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I’d gone too\nfar as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I did what I thought best\nat the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him that I would\nnot speak to him again. That’s what we call it when two schoolfellows\nrefuse to have anything more to do with one another. Secretly I only\nmeant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then, if I saw signs\nof repentance, to hold out my hand to him again. That was my intention.\nBut what do you think happened? He heard Smurov’s message, his eyes\nflashed. ‘Tell Krassotkin from me,’ he cried, ‘that I will throw bread\nwith pins to all the dogs—all—all of them!’ ‘So he’s going in for a\nlittle temper. We must smoke it out of him.’ And I began to treat him\nwith contempt; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled\nsarcastically. And just then that affair with his father happened. You\nremember? You must realize that he was fearfully worked up by what had\nhappened already. The boys, seeing I’d given him up, set on him and\ntaunted him, shouting, ‘Wisp of tow, wisp of tow!’ And he had soon\nregular skirmishes with them, which I am very sorry for. They seem to\nhave given him one very bad beating. One day he flew at them all as\nthey were coming out of school. I stood a few yards off, looking on.\nAnd, I swear, I don’t remember that I laughed; it was quite the other\nway, I felt awfully sorry for him, in another minute I would have run\nup to take his part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I don’t know what he\nfancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and struck at my\nthigh, here in my right leg. I didn’t move. I don’t mind owning I am\nplucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him contemptuously, as\nthough to say, ‘This is how you repay all my kindness! Do it again, if\nyou like, I’m at your service.’ But he didn’t stab me again; he broke\ndown, he was frightened at what he had done, he threw away the knife,\nburst out crying, and ran away. I did not sneak on him, of course, and\nI made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn’t come to the ears of the\nmasters. I didn’t even tell my mother till it had healed up. And the\nwound was a mere scratch. And then I heard that the same day he’d been\nthrowing stones and had bitten your finger—but you understand now what\na state he was in! Well, it can’t be helped: it was stupid of me not to\ncome and forgive him—that is, to make it up with him—when he was taken\nill. I am sorry for it now. But I had a special reason. So now I’ve\ntold you all about it ... but I’m afraid it was stupid of me.”",
            "3": "“Oh, what a pity,” exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, “that I didn’t know\nbefore what terms you were on with him, or I’d have come to you long\nago to beg you to go to him with me. Would you believe it, when he was\nfeverish he talked about you in delirium. I didn’t know how much you\nwere to him! And you’ve really not succeeded in finding that dog? His\nfather and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it. Would\nyou believe it, since he’s been ill, I’ve three times heard him repeat\nwith tears, ‘It’s because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now.\nGod is punishing me for it.’ He can’t get that idea out of his head.\nAnd if the dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost\nfancy the joy would cure him. We have all rested our hopes on you.”\n\n“Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him?”\nKolya asked, with great curiosity. “Why did you reckon on me rather\nthan any one else?”\n\n“There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you\nwould bring it when you’d found it. Smurov said something of the sort.\nWe’ve all been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that\nit’s been seen. The boys brought him a live hare; he just looked at it,\nwith a faint smile, and asked them to set it free in the fields. And so\nwe did. His father has just this moment come back, bringing him a\nmastiff pup, hoping to comfort him with that; but I think it only makes\nit worse.”\n\n“Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father? I know him, but\nwhat do you make of him—a mountebank, a buffoon?”\n\n“Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow\ncrushed. Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those\nto whom they daren’t speak the truth, from having been for years\nhumiliated and intimidated by them. Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort\nof buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is\ncentered in Ilusha, and if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with\ngrief or kill himself. I feel almost certain of that when I look at him\nnow.”\n\n“I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,” Kolya\nadded, with feeling.\n\n“And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you\nwere bringing.”",
            "4": "“Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is\nPerezvon. I’ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more\nthan the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in\na minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!” Kolya cried suddenly.\n“You’ve no overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I\nam. Oh, we are all egoists, Karamazov!”\n\n“Don’t trouble; it is cold, but I don’t often catch cold. Let us go in,\nthough, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called\nKolya, but what else?”\n\n“Nikolay—Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in official\ndocuments, ‘Krassotkin son.’ ” Kolya laughed for some reason, but added\nsuddenly, “Of course I hate my name Nikolay.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“It’s so trivial, so ordinary.”\n\n“You are thirteen?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“No, fourteen—that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight.\nI’ll confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since it’s\nour first meeting, so that you may understand my character at once. I\nhate being asked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... there’s a\nlibelous story going about me, that last week I played robbers with the\npreparatory boys. It’s a fact that I did play with them, but it’s a\nperfect libel to say I did it for my own amusement. I have reasons for\nbelieving that you’ve heard the story; but I wasn’t playing for my own\namusement, it was for the sake of the children, because they couldn’t\nthink of anything to do by themselves. But they’ve always got some\nsilly tale. This is an awful town for gossip, I can tell you.”\n\n“But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what’s the\nharm?”\n\n“Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don’t play horses, do you?”\n\n“But you must look at it like this,” said Alyosha, smiling. “Grown‐up\npeople go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of\nheroes are represented—sometimes there are robbers and battles, too—and\nisn’t that just the same thing, in a different form, of course? And\nyoung people’s games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also\nart in its first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic\ninstincts of the young. And sometimes these games are much better than\nperformances in the theater, the only difference is that people go\nthere to look at the actors, while in these games the young people are\nthe actors themselves. But that’s only natural.”",
            "5": "“You think so? Is that your idea?” Kolya looked at him intently. “Oh,\nyou know, that’s rather an interesting view. When I go home, I’ll think\nit over. I’ll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I’ve\ncome to learn of you, Karamazov,” Kolya concluded, in a voice full of\nspontaneous feeling.\n\n“And I of you,” said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand.\n\nKolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that he\ntreated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if\nhe were “quite grown up.”\n\n“I’ll show you something directly, Karamazov; it’s a theatrical\nperformance, too,” he said, laughing nervously. “That’s why I’ve come.”\n\n“Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys\nleave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.”\n\n“Oh, I’m only coming in for a minute. I’ll keep on my overcoat.\nPerezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon,\nlie down and be dead! You see how he’s dead. I’ll go in first and\nexplore, then I’ll whistle to him when I think fit, and you’ll see,\nhe’ll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at\nthe moment. I’ll arrange it all and you’ll see something.”"

            "0": "The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is\nalready familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment\nwith a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and\nthough all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was\nAlyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was\nreally the fact. All the art he had used had been to take them, one by\none, to Ilusha, without “sheepish sentimentality,” appearing to do so\ncasually and without design. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in\nhis suffering. He was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender\naffection and sympathy shown him by these boys, who had been his\nenemies. Krassotkin was the only one missing and his absence was a\nheavy load on Ilusha’s heart. Perhaps the bitterest of all his bitter\nmemories was his stabbing Krassotkin, who had been his one friend and\nprotector. Clever little Smurov, who was the first to make it up with\nIlusha, thought it was so. But when Smurov hinted to Krassotkin that\nAlyosha wanted to come and see him about something, the latter cut him\nshort, bidding Smurov tell “Karamazov” at once that he knew best what\nto do, that he wanted no one’s advice, and that, if he went to see\nIlusha, he would choose his own time for he had “his own reasons.”",
            "1": "That was a fortnight before this Sunday. That was why Alyosha had not\nbeen to see him, as he had meant to. But though he waited, he sent\nSmurov to him twice again. Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt,\nimpatient refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any\nmore, that if he came himself, he, Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha\nat all. Up to the very last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant\nto go to Ilusha that morning, and only the evening before, as he parted\nfrom Smurov, Kolya abruptly told him to wait at home for him next\nmorning, for he would go with him to the Snegiryovs’, but warned him on\nno account to say he was coming, as he wanted to drop in casually.\nSmurov obeyed. Smurov’s fancy that Kolya would bring back the lost dog\nwas based on the words Kolya had dropped that “they must be asses not\nto find the dog, if it was alive.” When Smurov, waiting for an\nopportunity, timidly hinted at his guess about the dog, Krassotkin flew\ninto a violent rage. “I’m not such an ass as to go hunting about the\ntown for other people’s dogs when I’ve got a dog of my own! And how can\nyou imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin? Sheepish\nsentimentality, that’s what it is!”\n\nFor the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the\nikons in the corner. He had not been to school since the day he met\nAlyosha and bit his finger. He was taken ill the same day, though for a\nmonth afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the\nroom and passage. But latterly he had become so weak that he could not\nmove without help from his father. His father was terribly concerned\nabout him. He even gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror\nthat his boy would die. And often, especially after leading him round\nthe room on his arm and putting him back to bed, he would run to a dark\ncorner in the passage and, leaning his head against the wall, he would\nbreak into paroxysms of violent weeping, stifling his sobs that they\nmight not be heard by Ilusha.",
            "2": "Returning to the room, he would usually begin doing something to amuse\nand comfort his precious boy; he would tell him stories, funny\nanecdotes, or would mimic comic people he had happened to meet, even\nimitate the howls and cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear to\nsee his father fooling and playing the buffoon. Though the boy tried\nnot to show how he disliked it, he saw with an aching heart that his\nfather was an object of contempt, and he was continually haunted by the\nmemory of the “wisp of tow” and that “terrible day.”\n\nNina, Ilusha’s gentle, crippled sister, did not like her father’s\nbuffoonery either (Varvara had been gone for some time past to\nPetersburg to study at the university). But the half‐imbecile mother\nwas greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began\ncapering about or performing something. It was the only way she could\nbe amused; all the rest of the time she was grumbling and complaining\nthat now every one had forgotten her, that no one treated her with\nrespect, that she was slighted, and so on. But during the last few days\nshe had completely changed. She began looking constantly at Ilusha’s\nbed in the corner and seemed lost in thought. She was more silent,\nquieter, and, if she cried, she cried quietly so as not to be heard.\nThe captain noticed the change in her with mournful perplexity. The\nboys’ visits at first only angered her, but later on their merry shouts\nand stories began to divert her, and at last she liked them so much\nthat, if the boys had given up coming, she would have felt dreary\nwithout them. When the children told some story or played a game, she\nlaughed and clapped her hands. She called some of them to her and\nkissed them. She was particularly fond of Smurov.\n\nAs for the captain, the presence in his room of the children, who came\nto cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy.\nHe even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression, and that\nthat would hasten his recovery. In spite of his alarm about Ilusha, he\nhad not, till lately, felt one minute’s doubt of his boy’s ultimate\nrecovery.",
            "3": "He met his little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot;\nhe was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his\nback, but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up. He began\nbuying little things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and\ncut them sandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he had plenty\nof money. He had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna\njust as Alyosha had predicted he would. And afterwards Katerina\nIvanovna, learning more about their circumstances and Ilusha’s illness,\nvisited them herself, made the acquaintance of the family, and\nsucceeded in fascinating the half‐ imbecile mother. Since then she had\nbeen lavish in helping them, and the captain, terror‐stricken at the\nthought that his boy might be dying, forgot his pride and humbly\naccepted her assistance.\n\nAll this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina\nIvanovna, came punctually every other day, but little was gained by his\nvisits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly. But on that Sunday morning\na new doctor was expected, who had come from Moscow, where he had a\ngreat reputation. Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at\ngreat expense, not expressly for Ilusha, but for another object of\nwhich more will be said in its place hereafter. But, as he had come,\nshe had asked him to see Ilusha as well, and the captain had been told\nto expect him. He hadn’t the slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was\ncoming, though he had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom\nIlusha was fretting.",
            "4": "At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room,\nthe captain and all the boys were round Ilusha’s bed, looking at a tiny\nmastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the\ncaptain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was\nstill fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who\nhad heard three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy,\nnot an ordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff (a very important point,\nof course), tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was\npleased. But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the\npuppy only served to recall to his little heart the thought of the\nunhappy dog he had killed. The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and\nhe, smiling sadly, stroked it with his thin, pale, wasted hand. Clearly\nhe liked the puppy, but ... it wasn’t Zhutchka; if he could have had\nZhutchka and the puppy, too, then he would have been completely happy.\n\n“Krassotkin!” cried one of the boys suddenly. He was the first to see\nhim come in.\n\nKrassotkin’s entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away and\nstood on each side of the bed, so that he could get a full view of\nIlusha. The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.\n\n“Please come in ... you are welcome!” he said hurriedly. “Ilusha, Mr.\nKrassotkin has come to see you!”\n\nBut Krassotkin, shaking hands with him hurriedly, instantly showed his\ncomplete knowledge of the manners of good society. He turned first to\nthe captain’s wife sitting in her arm‐chair, who was very ill‐humored\nat the moment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and\nIlusha’s bed and did not let her see the new puppy. With the greatest\ncourtesy he made her a bow, scraping his foot, and turning to Nina, he\nmade her, as the only other lady present, a similar bow. This polite\nbehavior made an extremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.\n\n“There, you can see at once he is a young man that has been well\nbrought up,” she commented aloud, throwing up her hands; “but as for\nour other visitors they come in one on the top of another.”\n\n“How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that?”\nmuttered the captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her\naccount.\n\n“That’s how they ride in. They get on each other’s shoulders in the\npassage and prance in like that on a respectable family. Strange sort\nof visitors!”\n\n“But who’s come in like that, mamma?”",
            "5": "“Why, that boy came in riding on that one’s back and this one on that\none’s.”\n\nKolya was already by Ilusha’s bedside. The sick boy turned visibly\npaler. He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya. Kolya\nhad not seen his little friend for two months, and he was overwhelmed\nat the sight of him. He had never imagined that he would see such a\nwasted, yellow face, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such\nthin little hands. He saw, with grieved surprise, Ilusha’s rapid, hard\nbreathing and dry lips. He stepped close to him, held out his hand, and\nalmost overwhelmed, he said:\n\n“Well, old man ... how are you?” But his voice failed him, he couldn’t\nachieve an appearance of ease; his face suddenly twitched and the\ncorners of his mouth quivered. Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile,\nstill unable to utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his hand\nand pass it over Ilusha’s hair.\n\n“Never mind!” he murmured softly to him to cheer him up, or perhaps not\nknowing why he said it. For a minute they were silent again.\n\n“Hallo, so you’ve got a new puppy?” Kolya said suddenly, in a most\ncallous voice.\n\n“Ye—es,” answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath.\n\n“A black nose, that means he’ll be fierce, a good house‐dog,” Kolya\nobserved gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he cared about was\nthe puppy and its black nose. But in reality he still had to do his\nutmost to control his feelings not to burst out crying like a child,\nand do what he would he could not control it. “When it grows up, you’ll\nhave to keep it on the chain, I’m sure.”\n\n“He’ll be a huge dog!” cried one of the boys.\n\n“Of course he will,” “a mastiff,” “large,” “like this,” “as big as a\ncalf,” shouted several voices.\n\n“As big as a calf, as a real calf,” chimed in the captain. “I got one\nlike that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his parents are\nhuge and very fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor.... Sit\ndown here, on Ilusha’s bed, or here on the bench. You are welcome,\nwe’ve been hoping to see you a long time.... You were so kind as to\ncome with Alexey Fyodorovitch?”\n\nKrassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha’s feet. Though he had\nperhaps prepared a free‐and‐easy opening for the conversation on his\nway, now he completely lost the thread of it.",
            "6": "“No ... I came with Perezvon. I’ve got a dog now, called Perezvon. A\nSlavonic name. He’s out there ... if I whistle, he’ll run in. I’ve\nbrought a dog, too,” he said, addressing Ilusha all at once. “Do you\nremember Zhutchka, old man?” he suddenly fired the question at him.\n\nIlusha’s little face quivered. He looked with an agonized expression at\nKolya. Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not\nto speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.\n\n“Where ... is Zhutchka?” Ilusha asked in a broken voice.\n\n“Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka’s lost and done for!”\n\nIlusha did not speak, but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya.\nAlyosha, catching Kolya’s eye, signed to him vigorously again, but he\nturned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed.\n\n“It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a\nmeal like that,” Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a little\nbreathless. “But I’ve got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I’ve\nbrought him to show you.”\n\n“I don’t want him!” said Ilusha suddenly.\n\n“No, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him\non purpose.... He’s the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to\ncall in my dog, madam?” He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with\ninexplicable excitement in his manner.\n\n“I don’t want him, I don’t want him!” cried Ilusha, with a mournful\nbreak in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes.\n\n“You’d better,” the captain started up from the chest by the wall on\nwhich he had just sat down, “you’d better ... another time,” he\nmuttered, but Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to\nSmurov, “Open the door,” and as soon as it was open, he blew his\nwhistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.\n\n“Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!” shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog\nstood erect on its hind‐legs by Ilusha’s bedside. What followed was a\nsurprise to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent\nover Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense.\n\n“It’s ... Zhutchka!” he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy\nand suffering.\n\n“And who did you think it was?” Krassotkin shouted with all his might,\nin a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and\nlifted him up to Ilusha.",
            "7": "“Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn,\njust the marks you described to me. It was by that I found him. I found\nhim directly. He did not belong to any one!” he explained, turning\nquickly to the captain, to his wife, to Alyosha and then again to\nIlusha. “He used to live in the Fedotovs’ back‐yard. Though he made his\nhome there, they did not feed him. He was a stray dog that had run away\nfrom the village ... I found him.... You see, old man, he couldn’t have\nswallowed what you gave him. If he had, he must have died, he must\nhave! So he must have spat it out, since he is alive. You did not see\nhim do it. But the pin pricked his tongue, that is why he squealed. He\nran away squealing and you thought he’d swallowed it. He might well\nsqueal, because the skin of dogs’ mouths is so tender ... tenderer than\nin men, much tenderer!” Kolya cried impetuously, his face glowing and\nradiant with delight. Ilusha could not speak. White as a sheet, he\ngazed open‐mouthed at Kolya, with his great eyes almost starting out of\nhis head. And if Krassotkin, who had no suspicion of it, had known what\na disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick\nchild’s health, nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on\nhim. But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realized\nit. As for the captain he behaved like a small child.\n\n“Zhutchka! It’s Zhutchka!” he cried in a blissful voice, “Ilusha, this\nis Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!” He was almost\nweeping.\n\n“And I never guessed!” cried Smurov regretfully. “Bravo, Krassotkin! I\nsaid he’d find the dog and here he’s found him.”\n\n“Here he’s found him!” another boy repeated gleefully.\n\n“Krassotkin’s a brick!” cried a third voice.\n\n“He’s a brick, he’s a brick!” cried the other boys, and they began\nclapping.",
            "8": "“Wait, wait,” Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. “I’ll\ntell you how it happened, that’s the whole point. I found him, I took\nhim home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not\nshow him to any one till to‐day. Only Smurov has known for the last\nfortnight, but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did\nnot guess. And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You\nshould only see all the things he can do! I trained him so as to bring\nyou a well‐trained dog, in good condition, old man, so as to be able to\nsay to you, ‘See, old man, what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!’\nHaven’t you a bit of meat? He’ll show you a trick that will make you\ndie with laughing. A piece of meat, haven’t you got any?”\n\nThe captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking\nwas done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted\nto Perezvon, “Dead!” And the dog immediately turned round and lay on\nhis back with its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked\non with the same suffering smile, but the person most delighted with\nthe dog’s performance was “mamma.” She laughed at the dog and began\nsnapping her fingers and calling it, “Perezvon, Perezvon!”\n\n“Nothing will make him get up, nothing!” Kolya cried triumphantly,\nproud of his success. “He won’t move for all the shouting in the world,\nbut if I call to him, he’ll jump up in a minute. Ici, Perezvon!” The\ndog leapt up and bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran\nback with a piece of cooked beef.\n\n“Is it hot?” Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business‐like air, taking\nthe meat. “Dogs don’t like hot things. No, it’s all right. Look,\neverybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren’t you looking? He does\nnot look at him, now I’ve brought him.”\n\nThe new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his\nnose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The\nluckless dog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as\nlong as his master chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for\nhalf an hour. But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment.\n\n“Paid for!” cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog’s\nnose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and\nsurprise.\n\n“Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the\ndog?” exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his\nvoice.",
            "9": "“Simply for that!” answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. “I wanted\nto show him in all his glory.”\n\n“Perezvon! Perezvon,” called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingers\nand beckoning to the dog.\n\n“What is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!” Kolya\nslapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both\narms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek. Ilusha\ncrept close to him, stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in\nthe dog’s shaggy coat.\n\n“Dear, dear!” kept exclaiming the captain. Kolya sat down again on the\nedge of the bed.\n\n“Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I’ve brought you a little\ncannon. You remember, I told you about it before and you said how much\nyou’d like to see it. Well, here, I’ve brought it to you.”\n\nAnd Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon.\nHe hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have\nwaited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he\nhurried on regardless of all consideration. “You are all happy now,” he\nfelt, “so here’s something to make you happier!” He was perfectly\nenchanted himself.\n\n“I’ve been coveting this thing for a long while; it’s for you, old man,\nit’s for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him, he had it\nfrom his brother. I swopped a book from father’s book‐case for it, _A\nKinsman of Mahomet or Salutary Folly_, a scandalous book published in\nMoscow a hundred years ago, before they had any censorship. And Morozov\nhas a taste for such things. He was grateful to me, too....”",
            "10": "Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it.\nIlusha raised himself, and, with his right arm still round the dog, he\ngazed enchanted at the toy. The sensation was even greater when Kolya\nannounced that he had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off at\nonce “if it won’t alarm the ladies.” “Mamma” immediately asked to look\nat the toy closer and her request was granted. She was much pleased\nwith the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro\non her lap. She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired,\nwithout any idea of what she had been asked. Kolya showed the powder\nand the shot. The captain, as a military man, undertook to load it,\nputting in a minute quantity of powder. He asked that the shot might be\nput off till another time. The cannon was put on the floor, aiming\ntowards an empty part of the room, three grains of powder were thrust\ninto the touch‐hole and a match was put to it. A magnificent explosion\nfollowed. Mamma was startled, but at once laughed with delight. The\nboys gazed in speechless triumph. But the captain, looking at Ilusha,\nwas more enchanted than any of them. Kolya picked up the cannon and\nimmediately presented it to Ilusha, together with the powder and the\nshot.\n\n“I got it for you, for you! I’ve been keeping it for you a long time,”\nhe repeated once more in his delight.\n\n“Oh, give it to me! No, give me the cannon!” mamma began begging like a\nlittle child. Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it.\nKolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily.\n\n“Mamma, mamma,” he ran to her, “the cannon’s yours, of course, but let\nIlusha have it, because it’s a present to him, but it’s just as good as\nyours. Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both\nof you, both of you.”\n\n“No, I don’t want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine\naltogether, not Ilusha’s,” persisted mamma, on the point of tears.\n\n“Take it, mother, here, keep it!” Ilusha cried. “Krassotkin, may I give\nit to my mother?” he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as\nthough he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to\nsome one else.\n\n“Of course you may,” Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the\ncannon from Ilusha, he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow.\nShe was so touched that she cried.\n\n“Ilusha, darling, he’s the one who loves his mamma!” she said tenderly,\nand at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again.",
            "11": "“Mamma, let me kiss your hand.” The captain darted up to her at once\nand did so.\n\n“And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,” said the\ngrateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.\n\n“And I’ll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the\npowder ourselves now. Borovikov found out how it’s made—twenty‐four\nparts of saltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal. It’s\nall pounded together, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through\na tammy sieve—that’s how it’s done.”\n\n“Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it’s not real\ngunpowder,” responded Ilusha.\n\n“Not real?” Kolya flushed. “It burns. I don’t know, of course.”\n\n“No, I didn’t mean that,” put in the captain with a guilty face. “I\nonly said that real powder is not made like that, but that’s nothing,\nit can be made so.”\n\n“I don’t know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it\nburned splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash. But that\nwas only the paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you\nknow best, I don’t know.... And Bulkin’s father thrashed him on account\nof our powder, did you hear?” he turned to Ilusha.\n\n“Yes,” answered Ilusha. He listened to Kolya with immense interest and\nenjoyment.\n\n“We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his\nbed. His father saw it. He said it might explode, and thrashed him on\nthe spot. He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters.\nHe is not allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go\nabout with me now. Smurov is not allowed to either, I’ve got a bad name\nwith every one. They say I’m a ‘desperate character,’ ” Kolya smiled\nscornfully. “It all began from what happened on the railway.”\n\n“Ah, we’ve heard of that exploit of yours, too,” cried the captain.\n“How could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren’t the\nleast afraid, lying there under the train? Weren’t you frightened?”\n\nThe captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya.\n\n“N—not particularly,” answered Kolya carelessly. “What’s blasted my\nreputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,” he said,\nturning again to Ilusha. But though he assumed an unconcerned air as he\ntalked, he still could not control himself and was continually missing\nthe note he tried to keep up.\n\n“Ah! I heard about the goose!” Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. “They\ntold me, but I didn’t understand. Did they really take you to the\ncourt?”",
            "12": "“The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill as\nthey always do,” Kolya began carelessly. “I was walking through the\nmarket‐place here one day, just when they’d driven in the geese. I\nstopped and looked at them. All at once a fellow, who is an errand‐boy\nat Plotnikov’s now, looked at me and said, ‘What are you looking at the\ngeese for?’ I looked at him; he was a stupid, moon‐faced fellow of\ntwenty. I am always on the side of the peasantry, you know. I like\ntalking to the peasants.... We’ve dropped behind the peasants—that’s an\naxiom. I believe you are laughing, Karamazov?”\n\n“No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,” said Alyosha with a most\ngood‐natured air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.",
            "13": "“My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,” he hurried on again,\nlooking pleased. “I believe in the people and am always glad to give\nthem their due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a _sine qua\nnon_ ... But I was telling you about the goose. So I turned to the fool\nand answered, ‘I am wondering what the goose thinks about.’ He looked\nat me quite stupidly, ‘And what does the goose think about?’ he asked.\n‘Do you see that cart full of oats?’ I said. ‘The oats are dropping out\nof the sack, and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to\ngobble them up—do you see?’ ‘I see that quite well,’ he said. ‘Well,’\nsaid I, ‘if that cart were to move on a little, would it break the\ngoose’s neck or not?’ ‘It’d be sure to break it,’ and he grinned all\nover his face, highly delighted. ‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’\n‘Let’s,’ he said. And it did not take us long to arrange: he stood at\nthe bridle without being noticed, and I stood on one side to direct the\ngoose. And the owner wasn’t looking, he was talking to some one, so I\nhad nothing to do, the goose thrust its head in after the oats of\nitself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I winked at the lad, he\ntugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose’s neck was broken in half.\nAnd, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at that moment and\nthey kicked up a shindy at once. ‘You did that on purpose!’ ‘No, not on\npurpose.’ ‘Yes, you did, on purpose!’ Well, they shouted, ‘Take him to\nthe justice of the peace!’ They took me, too. ‘You were there, too,’\nthey said, ‘you helped, you’re known all over the market!’ And, for\nsome reason, I really am known all over the market,” Kolya added\nconceitedly. “We all went off to the justice’s, they brought the goose,\ntoo. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubbering like a\nwoman. And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number of\ngeese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses. The justice of\nthe peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a\nrouble for the goose, and the fellow to have the goose. And he was\nwarned not to play such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering\nlike a woman. ‘It wasn’t me,’ he said, ‘it was he egged me on,’ and he\npointed to me. I answered with the utmost composure that I hadn’t egged\nhim on, that I simply stated the general proposition, had spoken\nhypothetically. The justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with\nhimself at once for having smiled. ‘I’ll complain to your masters of\nyou, so that for the future you mayn’t waste your time on such general\npropositions, instead of sitting at your books and learning your\nlessons.’ He didn’t complain to the masters, that was a joke, but the\nmatter was noised abroad and came to the ears of the masters. Their\nears are long, you know! The classical master, Kolbasnikov, was\nparticularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off again. But\nKolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass. Did you\nknow, Ilusha, he is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles,\nand his bride’s a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.\nThe third‐class fellows wrote an epigram on it:",
            "14": "Astounding news has reached the class,\nKolbasnikov has been an ass.\n\n\nAnd so on, awfully funny, I’ll bring it to you later on. I say nothing\nagainst Dardanelov, he is a learned man, there’s no doubt about it. I\nrespect men like that and it’s not because he stood up for me.”\n\n“But you took him down about the founders of Troy!” Smurov put in\nsuddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment. He was\nparticularly pleased with the story of the goose.\n\n“Did you really take him down?” the captain inquired, in a flattering\nway. “On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me\nabout it at the time.”\n\n“He knows everything, father, he knows more than any of us!” put in\nIlusha; “he only pretends to be like that, but really he is top in\nevery subject....”\n\nIlusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.\n\n“Oh, that’s all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this\nan unimportant question,” said Kolya with haughty humility. He had by\nnow completely recovered his dignity, though he was still a little\nuneasy. He felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked\nabout the goose, for instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha\nhad looked serious and had not said a word all the time. And the vain\nboy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent\nbecause he despised him, and thought he was showing off before him. If\nhe dared to think anything like that Kolya would—\n\n“I regard the question as quite a trivial one,” he rapped out again,\nproudly.\n\n“And I know who founded Troy,” a boy, who had not spoken before, said\nsuddenly, to the surprise of every one. He was silent and seemed to be\nshy. He was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He was\nsitting near the door. Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement.\n\nThe fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a\nsecret for the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by\nreading Smaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when\nKolya’s back was turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay\namong Kolya’s books, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to\nthe foundation of Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy\nand could not bring himself to announce publicly that he too knew who\nhad founded Troy, afraid of what might happen and of Krassotkin’s\nsomehow putting him to shame over it. But now he couldn’t resist saying\nit. For weeks he had been longing to.",
            "15": "“Well, who did found it?” asked Kolya, turning to him with haughty\nsuperciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did know and at\nonce made up his mind how to take it. There was, so to speak, a\ndiscordant note in the general harmony.\n\n“Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,” the boy rapped\nout at once, and in the same instant he blushed, blushed so, that it\nwas painful to look at him. But the boys stared at him, stared at him\nfor a whole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and\nwere fastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy with\ndisdainful composure.\n\n“In what sense did they found it?” he deigned to comment at last. “And\nwhat is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do? Did they\ngo and each lay a brick, do you suppose?”\n\nThere was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson. He\nwas silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him so for a minute.\n\n“Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a\nnationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,” he\nadmonished him in stern, incisive tones. “But I attach no consequence\nto these old wives’ tales and I don’t think much of universal history\nin general,” he added carelessly, addressing the company generally.\n\n“Universal history?” the captain inquired, looking almost scared.\n\n“Yes, universal history! It’s the study of the successive follies of\nmankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are mathematics\nand natural science,” said Kolya. He was showing off and he stole a\nglance at Alyosha; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there. But\nAlyosha was still silent and still serious as before. If Alyosha had\nsaid a word it would have stopped him, but Alyosha was silent and “it\nmight be the silence of contempt,” and that finally irritated Kolya.\n\n“The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing\nmore. You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?”\n\n“I don’t agree,” said Alyosha, with a faint smile.",
            "16": "“The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a police\nmeasure, that’s simply why it has been introduced into our schools.” By\ndegrees Kolya began to get breathless again. “Latin and Greek were\nintroduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the\nintellect. It was dull before, so what could they do to make things\nduller? It was senseless enough before, so what could they do to make\nit more senseless? So they thought of Greek and Latin. That’s my\nopinion, I hope I shall never change it,” Kolya finished abruptly. His\ncheeks were flushed.\n\n“That’s true,” assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of\nconviction. He had listened attentively.\n\n“And yet he is first in Latin himself,” cried one of the group of boys\nsuddenly.\n\n“Yes, father, he says that and yet he is first in Latin,” echoed\nIlusha.\n\n“What of it?” Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise\nwas very sweet to him. “I am fagging away at Latin because I have to,\nbecause I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that\nwhatever you do, it’s worth doing it well. But in my soul I have a\nprofound contempt for the classics and all that fraud.... You don’t\nagree, Karamazov?”\n\n“Why ‘fraud’?” Alyosha smiled again.\n\n“Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all\nlanguages, so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they\nintroduced Latin, but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the\nintelligence. So what can one call it but a fraud?”\n\n“Why, who taught you all this?” cried Alyosha, surprised at last.\n\n“In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being\ntaught. Besides, what I said just now about the classics being\ntranslated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third\nclass.”\n\n“The doctor has come!” cried Nina, who had been silent till then.\n\nA carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate. The\ncaptain, who had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed\nheadlong out to meet him. “Mamma” pulled herself together and assumed a\ndignified air. Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows\nstraight. Nina, from her invalid chair, anxiously watched him putting\nthe bed tidy. The boys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to\ncome again in the evening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off\nthe bed.\n\n“I won’t go away, I won’t go away,” Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. “I’ll\nwait in the passage and come back when the doctor’s gone, I’ll come\nback with Perezvon.”",
            "17": "But by now the doctor had entered, an important‐looking person with\nlong, dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat.\nAs he crossed the threshold he stopped, taken aback; he probably\nfancied he had come to the wrong place. “How is this? Where am I?” he\nmuttered, not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap. The crowd,\nthe poverty of the room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner,\npuzzled him. The captain, bent double, was bowing low before him.\n\n“It’s here, sir, here, sir,” he muttered cringingly; “it’s here, you’ve\ncome right, you were coming to us...”\n\n“Sne‐gi‐ryov?” the doctor said loudly and pompously. “Mr. Snegiryov—is\nthat you?”\n\n“That’s me, sir!”\n\n“Ah!”\n\nThe doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and\nthrew off his coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his\nneck. The captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took\noff his cap.\n\n“Where is the patient?” he asked emphatically."

            "0": "“What do you think the doctor will say to him?” Kolya asked quickly.\n“What a repulsive mug, though, hasn’t he? I can’t endure medicine!”\n\n“Ilusha is dying. I think that’s certain,” answered Alyosha,\nmournfully.\n\n“They are rogues! Medicine’s a fraud! I am glad to have made your\nacquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time.\nI am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances.”\n\nKolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more\ndemonstrative, but he felt ill at ease. Alyosha noticed this, smiled,\nand pressed his hand.\n\n“I’ve long learned to respect you as a rare person,” Kolya muttered\nagain, faltering and uncertain. “I have heard you are a mystic and have\nbeen in the monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasn’t put\nme off. Contact with real life will cure you.... It’s always so with\ncharacters like yours.”\n\n“What do you mean by mystic? Cure me of what?” Alyosha was rather\nastonished.\n\n“Oh, God and all the rest of it.”\n\n“What, don’t you believe in God?”\n\n“Oh, I’ve nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but\n... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all\nthat ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented,”\nadded Kolya, beginning to blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might\nthink he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was\n“grown up.” “I haven’t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to\nhim,” Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly\nannoyed.\n\n“I must confess I can’t endure entering on such discussions,” he said\nwith a final air. “It’s possible for one who doesn’t believe in God to\nlove mankind, don’t you think so? Voltaire didn’t believe in God and\nloved mankind?” (“I am at it again,” he thought to himself.)\n\n“Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don’t\nthink he loved mankind very much either,” said Alyosha quietly, gently,\nand quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own\nage, or even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha’s apparent\ndiffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the\nquestion for him, little Kolya, to settle.\n\n“Have you read Voltaire?” Alyosha finished.\n\n“No, not to say read.... But I’ve read _Candide_ in the Russian\ntranslation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it\nagain! again!)”\n\n“And did you understand it?”",
            "1": "“Oh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn’t\nunderstand it? There’s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of\ncourse I can understand that it’s a philosophical novel and written to\nadvocate an idea....” Kolya was getting mixed by now. “I am a\nSocialist, Karamazov, I am an incurable Socialist,” he announced\nsuddenly, apropos of nothing.\n\n“A Socialist?” laughed Alyosha. “But when have you had time to become\none? Why, I thought you were only thirteen?”\n\nKolya winced.\n\n“In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in a\nfortnight,” he flushed angrily, “and in the second place I am at a\ncomplete loss to understand what my age has to do with it? The question\nis what are my convictions, not what is my age, isn’t it?”\n\n“When you are older, you’ll understand for yourself the influence of\nage on convictions. I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your\nown ideas,” Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya\ninterrupted him hotly:\n\n“Come, you want obedience and mysticism. You must admit that the\nChristian religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and\nthe powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery. That’s so, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!”\ncried Alyosha.\n\n“I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me\nso. I can think for myself.... I am not opposed to Christ, if you like.\nHe was a most humane person, and if He were alive to‐day, He would be\nfound in the ranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a\nconspicuous part.... There’s no doubt about that.”\n\n“Oh, where, where did you get that from? What fool have you made\nfriends with?” exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n“Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked\nto Mr. Rakitin, of course, but ... old Byelinsky said that, too, so\nthey say.”\n\n“Byelinsky? I don’t remember. He hasn’t written that anywhere.”\n\n“If he didn’t write it, they say he said it. I heard that from a ...\nbut never mind.”\n\n“And have you read Byelinsky?”\n\n“Well, no ... I haven’t read all of him, but ... I read the passage\nabout Tatyana, why she didn’t go off with Onyegin.”\n\n“Didn’t go off with Onyegin? Surely you don’t ... understand that\nalready?”",
            "2": "“Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov,” said Kolya, with a grin\nof irritation. “But please don’t suppose I am such a revolutionist. I\noften disagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at\nall for the emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a\nsubject race and must obey. _Les femmes tricottent_, as Napoleon said.”\nKolya, for some reason, smiled, “And on that question at least I am\nquite of one mind with that pseudo‐great man. I think, too, that to\nleave one’s own country and fly to America is mean, worse than\nmean—silly. Why go to America when one may be of great service to\nhumanity here? Now especially. There’s a perfect mass of fruitful\nactivity open to us. That’s what I answered.”\n\n“What do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going to\nAmerica already?”\n\n“I must own, they’ve been at me to go, but I declined. That’s between\nourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one. I\nsay this only to you. I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches\nof the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.\n\nLong will you remember\nThe house at the Chain bridge.\n\n\nDo you remember? It’s splendid. Why are you laughing? You don’t suppose\nI am fibbing, do you?” (“What if he should find out that I’ve only that\none number of _The Bell_ in father’s bookcase, and haven’t read any\nmore of it?” Kolya thought with a shudder.)\n\n“Oh, no, I am not laughing and don’t suppose for a moment that you are\nlying. No, indeed, I can’t suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly\ntrue. But tell me, have you read Pushkin—_Onyegin_, for instance?...\nYou spoke just now of Tatyana.”\n\n“No, I haven’t read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no\nprejudices, Karamazov; I want to hear both sides. What makes you ask?”\n\n“Oh, nothing.”\n\n“Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?” Kolya rapped\nout suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he were on\ndrill. “Be so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.”\n\n“I have a contempt for you?” Alyosha looked at him wondering. “What\nfor? I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be\nperverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life.”\n\n“Don’t be anxious about my nature,” Kolya interrupted, not without\ncomplacency. “But it’s true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely\nsensitive. You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to—”",
            "3": "“Oh, my smile meant something quite different. I’ll tell you why I\nsmiled. Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had\nlived in Russia, on our students and schoolboys of to‐day. ‘Show a\nRussian schoolboy,’ he writes, ‘a map of the stars, which he knows\nnothing about, and he will give you back the map next day with\ncorrections on it.’ No knowledge and unbounded conceit—that’s what the\nGerman meant to say about the Russian schoolboy.”\n\n“Yes, that’s perfectly right,” Kolya laughed suddenly, “exactly so!\nBravo the German! But he did not see the good side, what do you think?\nConceit may be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need\nbe, but, on the other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from\nchildhood, boldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of\nthese sausage makers, groveling before authority.... But the German was\nright all the same. Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all\nthe same. Though they are so good at science and learning they must be\nstrangled.”\n\n“Strangled, what for?” smiled Alyosha.\n\n“Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. I am awfully childish\nsometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can’t restrain myself\nand am ready to talk any stuff. But, I say, we are chattering away here\nabout nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there. But\nperhaps he’s examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked\nthat Nina, you know. She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away,\n‘Why didn’t you come before?’ And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I\nthink she is awfully nice and pathetic.”\n\n“Yes, yes! Well, you’ll be coming often, you will see what she is like.\nIt would do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn\nto value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these\npeople,” Alyosha observed warmly. “That would have more effect on you\nthan anything.”\n\n“Oh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!” Kolya\nexclaimed, with bitter feeling.\n\n“Yes, it’s a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor\nchild was to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!”\n\n“Don’t tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept me\nfrom coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly\nwilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I’ve been struggling\nwith it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways,\nKaramazov!”",
            "4": "“No, you have a charming nature, though it’s been distorted, and I\nquite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous,\nmorbidly sensitive boy,” Alyosha answered warmly.\n\n“And you say that to me!” cried Kolya; “and would you believe it, I\nthought—I’ve thought several times since I’ve been here—that you\ndespised me! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!”\n\n“But are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it,\njust now, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched\nyou, that you must be very sensitive!”\n\n“You thought so? What an eye you’ve got, I say! I bet that was when I\nwas talking about the goose. That was just when I was fancying you had\na great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for\na moment I quite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool. Then\nI fancied—just now, here—when I said that if there were no God He would\nhave to be invented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my\nknowledge, especially as I got that phrase out of a book. But I swear I\nwasn’t showing off out of vanity, though I really don’t know why.\nBecause I was so pleased? Yes, I believe it was because I was so\npleased ... though it’s perfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing\ndirectly they are pleased, I know that. But I am convinced now that you\ndon’t despise me; it was all my imagination. Oh, Karamazov, I am\nprofoundly unhappy. I sometimes fancy all sorts of things, that every\none is laughing at me, the whole world, and then I feel ready to\noverturn the whole order of things.”\n\n“And you worry every one about you,” smiled Alyosha.\n\n“Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother. Karamazov, tell\nme, am I very ridiculous now?”",
            "5": "“Don’t think about that, don’t think of it at all!” cried Alyosha. “And\nwhat does ridiculous mean? Isn’t every one constantly being or seeming\nridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid\nof being ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy. All I am surprised at\nis that you should be feeling that so early, though I’ve observed it\nfor some time past, and not only in you. Nowadays the very children\nhave begun to suffer from it. It’s almost a sort of insanity. The devil\nhas taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole\ngeneration; it’s simply the devil,” added Alyosha, without a trace of\nthe smile that Kolya, staring at him, expected to see. “You are like\nevery one else,” said Alyosha, in conclusion, “that is, like very many\nothers. Only you must not be like everybody else, that’s all.”\n\n“Even if every one is like that?”\n\n“Yes, even if every one is like that. You be the only one not like it.\nYou really are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to\nconfess to something bad and even ridiculous. And who will admit so\nmuch in these days? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the\nimpulse to self‐ criticism. Don’t be like every one else, even if you\nare the only one.”\n\n“Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one. Oh,\nhow I have longed to know you, Karamazov! I’ve long been eager for this\nmeeting. Can you really have thought about me, too? You said just now\nthat you thought of me, too?”\n\n“Yes, I’d heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if it’s\npartly vanity that makes you ask, it doesn’t matter.”\n\n“Do you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,”\nsaid Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice. “That’s not ridiculous, is\nit?”\n\n“Not at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn’t matter, because\nit’s been a good thing.” Alyosha smiled brightly.\n\n“But do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little\nashamed yourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.” Kolya smiled with a\nsort of sly happiness.\n\n“Why ashamed?”\n\n“Well, why are you blushing?”\n\n“It was you made me blush,” laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush.\n“Oh, well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don’t know...” he\nmuttered, almost embarrassed.\n\n“Oh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are\nrather ashamed! Because you are just like me,” cried Kolya, in positive\necstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed.",
            "6": "“You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,” something\nmade Alyosha say suddenly.\n\n“I know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!” Kolya agreed at once.\n\n“But you will bless life on the whole, all the same.”\n\n“Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together,\nKaramazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me\nquite like an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are\nbetter! But we shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, I’ve\nbeen saying to myself, ‘Either we shall be friends at once, for ever,\nor we shall part enemies to the grave!’ ”\n\n“And saying that, of course, you loved me,” Alyosha laughed gayly.\n\n“I did. I loved you awfully. I’ve been loving and dreaming of you. And\nhow do you know it all beforehand? Ah, here’s the doctor. Goodness!\nWhat will he tell us? Look at his face!”"

He cast a cursory glance round\nthe passage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so. Alyosha\nwaved from the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought\nthe doctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and,\nbowing apologetically, stopped him to get the last word. The poor\nfellow looked utterly crushed; there was a scared look in his eyes.\n\n“Your Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?” he began, but\ncould not go on and clasped his hands in despair. Yet he still gazed\nimploringly at the doctor, as though a word from him might still change\nthe poor boy’s fate.\n\n“I can’t help it, I am not God!” the doctor answered offhand, though\nwith the customary impressiveness.\n\n“Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?”\n\n“You must be prepared for anything,” said the doctor in emphatic and\nincisive tones, and dropping his eyes, he was about to step out to the\ncoach.\n\n“Your Excellency, for Christ’s sake!” the terror‐stricken captain\nstopped him again. “Your Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely\nnothing save him now?”\n\n“It’s not in my hands now,” said the doctor impatiently, “but h’m!...”\nhe stopped suddenly. “If you could, for instance ... send ... your\npatient ... at once, without delay” (the words “at once, without\ndelay,” the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made\nthe captain start) “to Syracuse, the change to the new be‐ne‐ficial\nclimatic conditions might possibly effect—”\n\n“To Syracuse!” cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said.\n\n“Syracuse is in Sicily,” Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation. The\ndoctor looked at him.\n\n“Sicily! your Excellency,” faltered the captain, “but you’ve seen”—he\nspread out his hands, indicating his surroundings—“mamma and my\nfamily?”\n\n“N—no, Sicily is not the place for the family, the family should go to\nCaucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus,\nand your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her\nrheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist\nLepelletier; I could give you a note to him, and then ... there might\nbe a change—”\n\n“Doctor, doctor! But you see!” The captain flung wide his hands again\ndespairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.",
            "1": "“Well, that’s not my business,” grinned the doctor. “I have only told\nyou the answer of medical science to your question as to possible\ntreatment. As for the rest, to my regret—”\n\n“Don’t be afraid, apothecary, my dog won’t bite you,” Kolya rapped out\nloudly, noticing the doctor’s rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who was\nstanding in the doorway. There was a wrathful note in Kolya’s voice. He\nused the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he\nexplained afterwards, used it “to insult him.”\n\n“What’s that?” The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise at\nKolya. “Who’s this?” he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him to\nexplain.\n\n“It’s Perezvon’s master, don’t worry about me,” Kolya said incisively\nagain.\n\n“Perezvon?”[7] repeated the doctor, perplexed.\n\n“He hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good‐by, we shall\nmeet in Syracuse.”\n\n“Who’s this? Who’s this?” The doctor flew into a terrible rage.\n\n“He is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice of\nhim,” said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. “Kolya, hold your\ntongue!” he cried to Krassotkin. “Take no notice of him, doctor,” he\nrepeated, rather impatiently.\n\n“He wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!” The doctor stamped in a\nperfect fury.\n\n“And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!” said Kolya, turning\npale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. “_Ici_, Perezvon!”\n\n“Kolya, if you say another word, I’ll have nothing more to do with\nyou,” Alyosha cried peremptorily.\n\n“There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay\nKrassotkin—this is the man”; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. “I obey him,\ngood‐ by!”\n\nHe stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner\nroom. Perezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds\nin amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out\nquickly to the carriage, repeating aloud, “This is ... this is ... I\ndon’t know what it is!” The captain darted forward to help him into the\ncarriage. Alyosha followed Kolya into the room. He was already by\nIlusha’s bedside. The sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his\nfather. A minute later the captain, too, came back.\n\n“Father, father, come ... we ...” Ilusha faltered in violent\nexcitement, but apparently unable to go on, he flung his wasted arms\nround his father and Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging\nthem as tightly as he could. The captain suddenly began to shake with\ndumb sobs, and Kolya’s lips and chin twitched.",
            "2": "“Father, father! How sorry I am for you!” Ilusha moaned bitterly.\n\n“Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ...\nwe shall be happy ... the doctor ...” the captain began.\n\n“Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me.... I\nsaw!” cried Ilusha, and again he hugged them both with all his\nstrength, hiding his face on his father’s shoulder.\n\n“Father, don’t cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ...\nchoose one of them all, a good one, call him Ilusha and love him\ninstead of me....”\n\n“Hush, old man, you’ll get well,” Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice\nthat sounded angry.\n\n“But don’t ever forget me, father,” Ilusha went on, “come to my grave\n... and, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our\nwalk, and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and\nPerezvon ... I shall expect you.... Father, father!”\n\nHis voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was\ncrying quietly in her chair, and at last seeing them all crying,\n“mamma,” too, burst into tears.\n\n“Ilusha! Ilusha!” she exclaimed.\n\nKrassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha’s embrace.\n\n“Good‐by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,” he said quickly.\n“What a pity I did not tell her! She will be dreadfully anxious.... But\nafter dinner I’ll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole\nevening, and I’ll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things.\nAnd I’ll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him with me, because he\nwill begin to howl when I am away and bother you. Good‐by!”\n\nAnd he ran out into the passage. He didn’t want to cry, but in the\npassage he burst into tears. Alyosha found him crying.\n\n“Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he will be\nterribly disappointed,” Alyosha said emphatically.\n\n“I will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before!” muttered\nKolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.\n\nAt that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed the\ndoor behind him. His face looked frenzied, his lips were trembling. He\nstood before the two and flung up his arms.\n\n“I don’t want a good boy! I don’t want another boy!” he muttered in a\nwild whisper, clenching his teeth. “If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my\ntongue—” He broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the\nwooden bench. Pressing his fists against his head, he began sobbing\nwith absurd whimpering cries, doing his utmost that his cries should\nnot be heard in the room.\n\nKolya ran out into the street.",
            "3": "“Good‐by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself?” he cried sharply and\nangrily to Alyosha.\n\n“I will certainly come in the evening.”\n\n“What was that he said about Jerusalem?... What did he mean by that?”\n\n“It’s from the Bible. ‘If I forget thee, Jerusalem,’ that is, if I\nforget all that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its\nplace, then may—”\n\n“I understand, that’s enough! Mind you come! _Ici_, Perezvon!” he cried\nwith positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he went home.\n\n\n\n\nBook XI. Ivan"

            "0": "Alyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov’s house\nto see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with\nan urgent message begging him to come. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha\nlearned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the\nprevious day. During the two months that had passed since Mitya’s\narrest, Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov’s house,\nboth from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three\ndays after Mitya’s arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for\nnearly five weeks. For one whole week she was unconscious. She was very\nmuch changed—thinner and a little sallow, though she had for the past\nfortnight been well enough to go out. But to Alyosha her face was even\nmore attractive than before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he went\nin to her. A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in\nher face. There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her, and a\nsteadfast, fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could\nbe discerned in her. There was a small vertical line between her brows\nwhich gave her charming face a look of concentrated thought, almost\naustere at the first glance. There was scarcely a trace of her former\nfrivolity.\n\nIt seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that\nhad overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested\nfor a terrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in\nspite of her illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over\nMitya, Grushenka had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness. There was\na soft light in the once proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with\nthe old vindictive fire when she was visited by one disturbing thought\nstronger than ever in her heart. The object of that uneasiness was the\nsame as ever—Katerina Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when\nshe lay in delirium. Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of\nher. Yet Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his prison,\nthough she might have done it whenever she liked. All this made a\ndifficult problem for Alyosha, for he was the only person to whom\nGrushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking\nadvice. Sometimes he was unable to say anything.",
            "1": "Full of anxiety he entered her lodging. She was at home. She had\nreturned from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid\nmovement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that\nshe had been expecting him with great impatience. A pack of cards dealt\nfor a game of “fools” lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the\nleather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay, half‐reclining, on it.\nHe wore a dressing‐ gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill\nand weak, though he was smiling blissfully. When the homeless old man\nreturned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before, he had simply\nstayed on and was still staying with her. He arrived with her in rain\nand sleet, sat down on the sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely\nat her with a timid, appealing smile. Grushenka, who was in terrible\ngrief and in the first stage of fever, almost forgot his existence in\nall she had to do the first half‐ hour after her arrival. Suddenly she\nchanced to look at him intently: he laughed a pitiful, helpless little\nlaugh. She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat. All\nthat day he sat in the same place, almost without stirring. When it got\ndark and the shutters were closed, Fenya asked her mistress:\n\n“Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?”\n\n“Yes; make him a bed on the sofa,” answered Grushenka.\n\nQuestioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had\nliterally nowhere to go, and that “Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me\nstraight that he wouldn’t receive me again and gave me five roubles.”",
            "2": "“Well, God bless you, you’d better stay, then,” Grushenka decided in\nher grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old\nman’s heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the\ndestitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the\nhouse even when she was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did\nnot turn him out, but went on serving him meals and making up his bed\non the sofa. Grushenka had grown used to him, and coming back from\nseeing Mitya (whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was\nreally well) she would sit down and begin talking to “Maximushka” about\ntrifling matters, to keep her from thinking of her sorrow. The old man\nturned out to be a good story‐teller on occasions, so that at last he\nbecame necessary to her. Grushenka saw scarcely any one else beside\nAlyosha, who did not come every day and never stayed long. Her old\nmerchant lay seriously ill at this time, “at his last gasp” as they\nsaid in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after Mitya’s trial.\nThree weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching, he made his\nsons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last and bade\nthem not leave him again. From that moment he gave strict orders to his\nservants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, “The\nmaster wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.”\nBut Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him.\n\n“You’ve come at last!” she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully\ngreeting Alyosha, “and Maximushka’s been scaring me that perhaps you\nwouldn’t come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you\nhave—coffee?”\n\n“Yes, please,” said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. “I am very\nhungry.”\n\n“That’s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,” cried Grushenka. “It’s been made\na long time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they\nare hot. Do you know, we’ve had a storm over those pies to‐day. I took\nthem to the prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them\nback to me: he would not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor\nand stamped on it. So I said to him: ‘I shall leave them with the\nwarder; if you don’t eat them before evening, it will be that your\nvenomous spite is enough for you!’ With that I went away. We quarreled\nagain, would you believe it? Whenever I go we quarrel.”\n\nGrushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov,\nfeeling nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.",
            "3": "“What did you quarrel about this time?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“I didn’t expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the\nPole. ‘Why are you keeping him?’ he said. ‘So you’ve begun keeping\nhim.’ He is jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and\nsleeping! He even took it into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last\nweek.”\n\n“But he knew about the Pole before?”\n\n“Yes, but there it is. He has known about him from the very beginning,\nbut to‐day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him. I am\nashamed to repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came\nout. Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on. What do you think?” she added\ncarelessly.\n\n“He loves you, that’s what it is: he loves you so much. And now he is\nparticularly worried.”\n\n“I should think he might be, with the trial to‐morrow. And I went to\nhim to say something about to‐morrow, for I dread to think what’s going\nto happen then. You say that he is worried, but how worried I am! And\nhe talks about the Pole! He’s too silly! He is not jealous of\nMaximushka yet, anyway.”\n\n“My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,” Maximov put in his word.\n\n“Jealous of you?” Grushenka laughed in spite of herself. “Of whom could\nshe have been jealous?”\n\n“Of the servant girls.”\n\n“Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel\nangry. Don’t ogle the pies. I shan’t give you any; they are not good\nfor you, and I won’t give you any vodka either. I have to look after\nhim, too, just as though I kept an almshouse,” she laughed.\n\n“I don’t deserve your kindness. I am a worthless creature,” said\nMaximov, with tears in his voice. “You would do better to spend your\nkindness on people of more use than me.”\n\n“Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who’s of\nmost use? If only that Pole didn’t exist, Alyosha. He’s taken it into\nhis head to fall ill, too, to‐day. I’ve been to see him also. And I\nshall send him some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn’t sent him any, but\nMitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here’s Fenya with\na letter! Yes, it’s from the Poles—begging again!”",
            "4": "Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and\ncharacteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him\nthree roubles. In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a\npromise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as\nwell. Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such\nreceipts, from her former lover during the fortnight of her\nconvalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after\nher health during her illness. The first letter Grushenka got from them\nwas a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest\non the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it\ndown before she had read half, unable to make head or tail of it. She\ncould not attend to letters then. The first letter was followed next\nday by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two\nthousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that letter,\ntoo, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed—one every\nday—all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually\ndiminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty‐five, to ten,\nand finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged\nher for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.\n\nThen Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round\nherself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty,\nalmost destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt\nto their landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from\nMitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at\ntheir meeting her with arrogant dignity and self‐assertion, with the\ngreatest punctilio and pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and\ngave her former admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of\nit and he was not in the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had\nattached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests\nfor money and she had always sent them small sums. And now that day\nMitya had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous.",
            "5": "“Like a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see\nMitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,” Grushenka began again with nervous\nhaste. “I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. ‘Fancy,’ I said, ‘my\nPole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar.\nHe thought I would be touched and marry him!’ Mitya leapt up\nswearing.... So, there, I’ll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that\nlittle girl they’ve sent? Here, give her three roubles and pack a dozen\npies up in a paper and tell her to take them. And you, Alyosha, be sure\nto tell Mitya that I did send them the pies.”\n\n“I wouldn’t tell him for anything,” said Alyosha, smiling.\n\n“Ech! You think he is unhappy about it. Why, he’s jealous on purpose.\nHe doesn’t care,” said Grushenka bitterly.\n\n“On purpose?” queried Alyosha.\n\n“I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all\nyour cleverness. I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like\nme. I would be offended if he were not jealous. I am like that. I am\nnot offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too. I can be jealous\nmyself. Only what offends me is that he doesn’t love me at all. I tell\nyou he is jealous now _on purpose_. Am I blind? Don’t I see? He began\ntalking to me just now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she was this\nand that, how she had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him, to try and\nsave him; how she had ordered the best counsel, the most learned one,\ntoo. So he loves her, if he’ll praise her to my face, more shame to\nhim! He’s treated me badly himself, so he attacked me, to make out I am\nin fault first and to throw it all on me. ‘You were with your Pole\nbefore me, so I can’t be blamed for Katerina,’ that’s what it amounts\nto. He wants to throw the whole blame on me. He attacked me on purpose,\non purpose, I tell you, but I’ll—”\n\nGrushenka could not finish saying what she would do. She hid her eyes\nin her handkerchief and sobbed violently.\n\n“He doesn’t love Katerina Ivanovna,” said Alyosha firmly.\n\n“Well, whether he loves her or not, I’ll soon find out for myself,”\nsaid Grushenka, with a menacing note in her voice, taking the\nhandkerchief from her eyes. Her face was distorted. Alyosha saw\nsorrowfully that from being mild and serene, it had become sullen and\nspiteful.",
            "6": "“Enough of this foolishness,” she said suddenly; “it’s not for that I\nsent for you. Alyosha, darling, to‐morrow—what will happen to‐morrow?\nThat’s what worries me! And it’s only me it worries! I look at every\none and no one is thinking of it. No one cares about it. Are you\nthinking about it even? To‐morrow he’ll be tried, you know. Tell me,\nhow will he be tried? You know it’s the valet, the valet killed him!\nGood heavens! Can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no\none stand up for him? They haven’t troubled the valet at all, have\nthey?”\n\n“He’s been severely cross‐examined,” observed Alyosha thoughtfully;\n“but every one came to the conclusion it was not he. Now he is lying\nvery ill. He has been ill ever since that attack. Really ill,” added\nAlyosha.\n\n“Oh, dear! couldn’t you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the\nwhole thing by yourself? He’s been brought from Petersburg for three\nthousand roubles, they say.”\n\n“We gave these three thousand together—Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and\nI—but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The\ncounsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become\nknown all over Russia; it’s talked of in all the papers and journals.\nFetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because\nthe case has become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.”\n\n“Well? Did you talk to him?” Grushenka put in eagerly.\n\n“He listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed\nhis opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.”\n\n“Consideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They’ll ruin him. And why did\nshe send for the doctor?”\n\n“As an expert. They want to prove that Mitya’s mad and committed the\nmurder when he didn’t know what he was doing”; Alyosha smiled gently;\n“but Mitya won’t agree to that.”\n\n“Yes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!” cried\nGrushenka. “He was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault,\nwretch that I am! But, of course, he didn’t do it, he didn’t do it! And\nthey are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya’s evidence went to\nprove he had done it. And the people at the shop, and that official,\nand at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him say so! They are\nall, all against him, all crying out against him.”\n\n“Yes, there’s a fearful accumulation of evidence,” Alyosha observed\ngrimly.",
            "7": "“And Grigory—Grigory Vassilyevitch—sticks to his story that the door\nwas open, persists that he saw it—there’s no shaking him. I went and\ntalked to him myself. He’s rude about it, too.”\n\n“Yes, that’s perhaps the strongest evidence against him,” said Alyosha.\n\n“And as for Mitya’s being mad, he certainly seems like it now,”\nGrushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air. “Do you\nknow, Alyosha, I’ve been wanting to talk to you about it for a long\ntime. I go to him every day and simply wonder at him. Tell me, now,\nwhat do you suppose he’s always talking about? He talks and talks and I\ncan make nothing of it. I fancied he was talking of something\nintellectual that I couldn’t understand in my foolishness. Only he\nsuddenly began talking to me about a babe—that is, about some child.\n‘Why is the babe poor?’ he said. ‘It’s for that babe I am going to\nSiberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to Siberia!’ What that\nmeant, what babe, I couldn’t tell for the life of me. Only I cried when\nhe said it, because he said it so nicely. He cried himself, and I\ncried, too. He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over\nme. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me? What is this babe?”\n\n“It must be Rakitin, who’s been going to see him lately,” smiled\nAlyosha, “though ... that’s not Rakitin’s doing. I didn’t see Mitya\nyesterday. I’ll see him to‐day.”\n\n“No, it’s not Rakitin; it’s his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting\nhim. It’s his going to see him, that’s what it is,” Grushenka began,\nand suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement.\n\n“Ivan’s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan\nhasn’t been once.”\n\n“There ... there! What a girl I am! Blurting things out!” exclaimed\nGrushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. “Stay, Alyosha, hush! Since\nI’ve said so much I’ll tell the whole truth—he’s been to see him twice,\nthe first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of\ncourse, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He\ntold Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not\nto tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.”\n\nAlyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news\nevidently impressed him.",
            "8": "“Ivan doesn’t talk to me of Mitya’s case,” he said slowly. “He’s said\nvery little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him,\nhe seems vexed at my coming, so I’ve not been to him for the last three\nweeks. H’m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been\na change in Mitya this week.”\n\n“There has been a change,” Grushenka assented quickly. “They have a\nsecret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret,\nand such a secret that Mitya can’t rest. Before then, he was\ncheerful—and, indeed, he is cheerful now—but when he shakes his head\nlike that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at\nthe hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there is\nsomething on his mind worrying him.... I know! He was cheerful before,\nthough, indeed, he is cheerful to‐day.”\n\n“But you said he was worried.”\n\n“Yes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a\nminute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know,\nAlyosha, I am constantly wondering at him—with this awful thing hanging\nover him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby\nhimself.”\n\n“And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say,\n‘Don’t tell him’?”\n\n“Yes, he told me, ‘Don’t tell him.’ It’s you that Mitya’s most afraid\nof. Because it’s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha,\ndarling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell\nme,” Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. “Set my mind at rest\nthat I may know the worst that’s in store for me. That’s why I sent for\nyou.”\n\n“You think it’s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn’t have\ntold you there was a secret.”\n\n“I don’t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn’t dare to. He\nwarns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won’t tell me what it\nis.”\n\n“What do you think yourself?”",
            "9": "“What do I think? It’s the end for me, that’s what I think. They all\nthree have been plotting my end, for Katerina’s in it. It’s all\nKaterina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means\nthat I am not. He tells me that beforehand—warns me. He is planning to\nthrow me over, that’s the whole secret. They’ve planned it together,\nthe three of them—Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I’ve\nbeen wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me\nthat Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.\nDid he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me\nthe worst.”\n\n“I won’t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I\nthink.”\n\n“Oh, that’s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver,\nthat’s what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the\nblame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can’t disguise what he is\ndoing; he is so open, you know.... But I’ll give it to him, I’ll give\nit to him! ‘You believe I did it,’ he said. He said that to me, to me.\nHe reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I’ll make it hot\nfor Katerina at the trial! I’ll just say a word then ... I’ll tell\neverything then!”\n\nAnd again she cried bitterly.\n\n“This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,” Alyosha said, getting up.\n“First, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world,\nand you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I\ndon’t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he’ll tell me of\nhimself to‐ day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to\ntell you. Then I’ll come to you to‐day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy\n... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is\nabout something else. That’s certain. It isn’t likely it’s about\nKaterina Ivanovna, it seems to me. Good‐by for now.”\n\nAlyosha shook hands with her. Grushenka was still crying. He saw that\nshe put little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having\nhad her sorrow out, for having spoken of it. He was sorry to leave her\nin such a state of mind, but he was in haste. He had a great many\nthings to do still."

Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three\nweeks: her foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she was not\nin bed, she lay all day half‐reclining on the couch in her boudoir, in\na fascinating but decorous _déshabillé_. Alyosha had once noted with\ninnocent amusement that, in spite of her illness, Madame Hohlakov had\nbegun to be rather dressy—top‐knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made\ntheir appearance, and he had an inkling of the reason, though he\ndismissed such ideas from his mind as frivolous. During the last two\nmonths the young official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at\nthe house.\n\nAlyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight\nto Lise, as it was with her he had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid\nto him the previous day, specially asking him to come to her “about\nsomething very important,” a request which, for certain reasons, had\ninterest for Alyosha. But while the maid went to take his name in to\nLise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival from some one, and\nimmediately sent to beg him to come to her “just for one minute.”\nAlyosha reflected that it was better to accede to the mamma’s request,\nor else she would be sending down to Lise’s room every minute that he\nwas there. Madame Hohlakov was lying on a couch. She was particularly\nsmartly dressed and was evidently in a state of extreme nervous\nexcitement. She greeted Alyosha with cries of rapture.",
            "1": "“It’s ages, ages, perfect ages since I’ve seen you! It’s a whole\nweek—only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on\nWednesday. You have come to see Lise. I’m sure you meant to slip into\nher room on tiptoe, without my hearing you. My dear, dear Alexey\nFyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am about her! But of that\nlater, though that’s the most important thing, of that later. Dear\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly with my Lise. Since the\ndeath of Father Zossima—God rest his soul!” (she crossed herself)—“I\nlook upon you as a monk, though you look charming in your new suit.\nWhere did you find such a tailor in these parts? No, no, that’s not the\nchief thing—of that later. Forgive me for sometimes calling you\nAlyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,” she smiled\ncoquettishly; “but that will do later, too. The important thing is that\nI shouldn’t forget what is important. Please remind me of it yourself.\nAs soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say ‘the important\nthing?’ Ach! how do I know now what is of most importance? Ever since\nLise took back her promise—her childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch—to\nmarry you, you’ve realized, of course, that it was only the playful\nfancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair—thank\nGod, she can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow\nfor your unhappy brother, who will to‐morrow—But why speak of to‐\nmorrow? I am ready to die at the very thought of to‐morrow. Ready to\ndie of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise....\nI paid him fifty roubles for the visit. But that’s not the point,\nthat’s not the point again. You see, I’m mixing everything up. I am in\nsuch a hurry. Why am I in a hurry? I don’t understand. It’s awful how I\nseem growing unable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up\nin a sort of tangle. I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and\nrun away, and that will be all I shall see of you. Goodness! Why are we\nsitting here and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee!”\n\nAlyosha made haste to thank her, and said that he had only just had\ncoffee.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“At Agrafena Alexandrovna’s.”",
            "2": "“At ... at that woman’s? Ah, it’s she has brought ruin on every one. I\nknow nothing about it though. They say she has become a saint, though\nit’s rather late in the day. She had better have done it before. What\nuse is it now? Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to\nsay to you that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing. This awful trial\n... I shall certainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried\nthere in my chair; besides I can sit up. I shall have people with me.\nAnd, you know, I am a witness. How shall I speak, how shall I speak? I\ndon’t know what I shall say. One has to take an oath, hasn’t one?”\n\n“Yes; but I don’t think you will be able to go.”\n\n“I can sit up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! this trial, this savage act, and\nthen they are all going to Siberia, some are getting married, and all\nthis so quickly, so quickly, everything’s changing, and at\nlast—nothing. All grow old and have death to look forward to. Well, so\nbe it! I am weary. This Katya, _cette charmante personne_, has\ndisappointed all my hopes. Now she is going to follow one of your\nbrothers to Siberia, and your other brother is going to follow her, and\nwill live in the nearest town, and they will all torment one another.\nIt drives me out of my mind. Worst of all—the publicity. The story has\nbeen told a million times over in all the papers in Moscow and\nPetersburg. Ah! yes, would you believe it, there’s a paragraph that I\nwas ‘a dear friend’ of your brother’s ——, I can’t repeat the horrid\nword. Just fancy, just fancy!”\n\n“Impossible! Where was the paragraph? What did it say?”\n\n“I’ll show you directly. I got the paper and read it yesterday. Here,\nin the Petersburg paper _Gossip_. The paper began coming out this year.\nI am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me\nout—this is what gossip comes to! Here it is, here, this passage. Read\nit.”\n\nAnd she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her\npillow.\n\nIt was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and\nperhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head. The\nparagraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock to her,\nbut, fortunately perhaps, she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any\none subject at that moment, and so might race off in a minute to\nsomething else and quite forget the newspaper.",
            "3": "Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread\nall over Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about his brother,\nabout the Karamazovs, and about himself he had read in the course of\nthose two months, among other equally credible items! One paper had\neven stated that he had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in\nhorror at his brother’s crime. Another contradicted this, and stated\nthat he and his elder, Father Zossima, had broken into the monastery\nchest and “made tracks from the monastery.” The present paragraph in\nthe paper _Gossip_ was under the heading, “The Karamazov Case at\nSkotoprigonyevsk.” (That, alas! was the name of our little town. I had\nhitherto kept it concealed.) It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not\ndirectly mentioned in it. No names appeared, in fact. It was merely\nstated that the criminal, whose approaching trial was making such a\nsensation—retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary\nbully—was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly\npopular with certain ladies “who were pining in solitude.” One such\nlady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she had a grown‐up\ndaughter, was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the crime\nshe offered him three thousand roubles, on condition that he would\nelope with her to the gold mines. But the criminal, counting on\nescaping punishment, had preferred to murder his father to get the\nthree thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle‐aged\ncharms of his pining lady. This playful paragraph finished, of course,\nwith an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide\nand at the lately abolished institution of serfdom. Reading it with\ncuriosity, Alyosha folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame\nHohlakov.\n\n“Well, that must be me,” she hurried on again. “Of course I am meant.\nScarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him, and\nhere they talk of ‘middle‐aged charms’ as though that were my motive!\nHe writes that out of spite! God Almighty forgive him for the\nmiddle‐aged charms, as I forgive him! You know it’s— Do you know who it\nis? It’s your friend Rakitin.”\n\n“Perhaps,” said Alyosha, “though I’ve heard nothing about it.”\n\n“It’s he, it’s he! No ‘perhaps’ about it. You know I turned him out of\nthe house.... You know all that story, don’t you?”\n\n“I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future, but why it\nwas, I haven’t heard ... from you, at least.”",
            "4": "“Ah, then you’ve heard it from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me\ndreadfully?”\n\n“Yes, he does; but then he abuses every one. But why you’ve given him\nup I haven’t heard from him either. I meet him very seldom now, indeed.\nWe are not friends.”",
            "5": "“Well, then, I’ll tell you all about it. There’s no help for it, I’ll\nconfess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a\nlittle, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn’t count. You see,\nmy dear boy”—Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming,\nthough enigmatic, smile played about her lips—“you see, I suspect ...\nYou must forgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no;\nquite the contrary. I speak to you now as though you were my\nfather—mother’s quite out of place. Well, it’s as though I were\nconfessing to Father Zossima, that’s just it. I called you a monk just\nnow. Well, that poor young man, your friend, Rakitin (Mercy on us! I\ncan’t be angry with him. I feel cross, but not very), that frivolous\nyoung man, would you believe it, seems to have taken it into his head\nto fall in love with me. I only noticed it later. At first—a month\nago—he only began to come oftener to see me, almost every day; though,\nof course, we were acquainted before. I knew nothing about it ... and\nsuddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with surprise.\nYou know, two months ago, that modest, charming, excellent young man,\nPyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who’s in the service here, began to be a\nregular visitor at the house. You met him here ever so many times\nyourself. And he is an excellent, earnest young man, isn’t he? He comes\nonce every three days, not every day (though I should be glad to see\nhim every day), and always so well dressed. Altogether, I love young\npeople, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he has almost the mind\nof a statesman, he talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly,\ncertainly try and get promotion for him. He is a future diplomat. On\nthat awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night.\nAnd your friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them\nout on the carpet.... He began hinting at his feelings, in fact, and\none day, as he was going, he squeezed my hand terribly hard. My foot\nbegan to swell directly after he pressed my hand like that. He had met\nPyotr Ilyitch here before, and would you believe it, he is always\ngibing at him, growling at him, for some reason. I simply looked at the\nway they went on together and laughed inwardly. So I was sitting here\nalone—no, I was laid up then. Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly\nRakitin comes in, and only fancy! brought me some verses of his own\ncomposition—a short poem, on my bad foot: that is, he described my foot\nin a poem. Wait a minute—how did it go?",
            "6": "A captivating little foot.",
            "7": "\nIt began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I’ve got it\nhere. I’ll show it to you later. But it’s a charming thing—charming;\nand, you know, it’s not only about the foot, it had a good moral, too,\na charming idea, only I’ve forgotten it; in fact, it was just the thing\nfor an album. So, of course, I thanked him, and he was evidently\nflattered. I’d hardly had time to thank him when in comes Pyotr\nIlyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as night. I could see\nthat Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for Rakitin certainly wanted to say\nsomething after giving me the verses. I had a presentiment of it; but\nPyotr Ilyitch came in. I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and didn’t say\nwho was the author. But I am convinced that he guessed, though he won’t\nown it to this day, and declares he had no idea. But he says that on\npurpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once, and fell to criticizing\nit. ‘Wretched doggerel,’ he said they were, ‘some divinity student must\nhave written them,’ and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then,\ninstead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. ‘Good gracious!’ I\nthought, ‘they’ll fly at each other.’ ‘It was I who wrote them,’ said\nhe. ‘I wrote them as a joke,’ he said, ‘for I think it degrading to\nwrite verses.... But they are good poetry. They want to put a monument\nto your Pushkin for writing about women’s feet, while I wrote with a\nmoral purpose, and you,’ said he, ‘are an advocate of serfdom. You’ve\nno humane ideas,’ said he. ‘You have no modern enlightened feelings,\nyou are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,’ he said,\n‘and you take bribes.’ Then I began screaming and imploring them. And,\nyou know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward. He at once took up\nthe most gentlemanly tone, looked at him sarcastically, listened, and\napologized. ‘I’d no idea,’ said he. ‘I shouldn’t have said it, if I had\nknown. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,’ he said.\nIn short, he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone.\nHe explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic. I thought he\nwas in earnest. Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought,\n‘Would it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin\nout for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?’ And, would you\nbelieve it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the\nproper thing or not. I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began\nto beat, and I couldn’t make up my mind whether to make an outcry or\nnot. One voice seemed to be telling me, ‘Speak,’ and the other ‘No,\ndon’t speak.’ And no sooner had the second voice said that than I cried\nout, and fainted. Of course, there was a fuss. I got up suddenly and\nsaid to Rakitin, ‘It’s painful for me to say it, but I don’t wish to\nsee you in my house again.’ So I turned him out. Ah! Alexey\nFyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it on. I wasn’t\nangry with him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied—that was what did\nit—that it would be such a fine scene.... And yet, believe me, it was\nquite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for several days\nafterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it. So\nit’s a fortnight since he’s been here, and I kept wondering whether he\nwould come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night\ncame this _Gossip_. I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He\nmust have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot,\nsent it, and they put it in. It was a fortnight ago, you see. But,\nAlyosha, it’s awful how I keep talking and don’t say what I want to\nsay. Ah! the words come of themselves!”",
            "8": "“It’s very important for me to be in time to see my brother to‐day,”\nAlyosha faltered.\n\n“To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is\nan aberration?”\n\n“What aberration?” asked Alyosha, wondering.\n\n“In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable.\nWhatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I’ll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she is a charming, charming\ncreature, only I never can make out who it is she is in love with. She\nwas with me some time ago and I couldn’t get anything out of her.\nEspecially as she won’t talk to me except on the surface now. She is\nalways talking about my health and nothing else, and she takes up such\na tone with me, too. I simply said to myself, ‘Well, so be it. I don’t\ncare’... Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration. This doctor has come.\nYou know a doctor has come? Of course, you know it—the one who\ndiscovers madmen. You wrote for him. No, it wasn’t you, but Katya. It’s\nall Katya’s doing. Well, you see, a man may be sitting perfectly sane\nand suddenly have an aberration. He may be conscious and know what he\nis doing and yet be in a state of aberration. And there’s no doubt that\nDmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration. They found out about\naberration as soon as the law courts were reformed. It’s all the good\neffect of the reformed law courts. The doctor has been here and\nquestioned me about that evening, about the gold mines. ‘How did he\nseem then?’ he asked me. He must have been in a state of aberration. He\ncame in shouting, ‘Money, money, three thousand! Give me three\nthousand!’ and then went away and immediately did the murder. ‘I don’t\nwant to murder him,’ he said, and he suddenly went and murdered him.\nThat’s why they’ll acquit him, because he struggled against it and yet\nhe murdered him.”\n\n“But he didn’t murder him,” Alyosha interrupted rather sharply. He felt\nmore and more sick with anxiety and impatience.\n\n“Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.”\n\n“Grigory?” cried Alyosha.\n\n“Yes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him\ndown, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor\nPavlovitch.”\n\n“But why, why?”",
            "9": "“Suffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri\nFyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he\nwent and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn’t, he very\nlikely doesn’t remember. Only, you know, it’ll be better, ever so much\nbetter, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that’s how it must\nhave been, though I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, and that’s better, ever so much better! Oh! not better\nthat a son should have killed his father, I don’t defend that. Children\nought to honor their parents, and yet it would be better if it were he,\nas you’d have nothing to cry over then, for he did it when he was\nunconscious or rather when he was conscious, but did not know what he\nwas doing. Let them acquit him—that’s so humane, and would show what a\nblessing reformed law courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say\nthey have been so a long time. And when I heard it yesterday, I was so\nstruck by it that I wanted to send for you at once. And if he is\nacquitted, make him come straight from the law courts to dinner with\nme, and I’ll have a party of friends, and we’ll drink to the reformed\nlaw courts. I don’t believe he’d be dangerous; besides, I’ll invite a\ngreat many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did\nanything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something\nin another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the\nbest judges. And, besides, who isn’t suffering from aberration\nnowadays?—you, I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are\never so many examples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly\nsomething annoys him, he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he\ncomes across, and no one blames him for it. I read that lately, and all\nthe doctors confirm it. The doctors are always confirming; they confirm\nanything. Why, my Lise is in a state of aberration. She made me cry\nagain yesterday, and the day before, too, and to‐day I suddenly\nrealized that it’s all due to aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I\nbelieve she’s quite mad. Why did she send for you? Did she send for you\nor did you come of yourself?”\n\n“Yes, she sent for me, and I am just going to her.” Alyosha got up\nresolutely.",
            "10": "“Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that’s what’s most\nimportant,” Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears. “God\nknows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it’s no matter her\nsending for you on the sly, without telling her mother. But forgive me,\nI can’t trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,\nthough I still consider him the most chivalrous young man. But only\nfancy, he’s been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!”\n\n“How? What? When?” Alyosha was exceedingly surprised. He had not sat\ndown again and listened standing.",
            "11": "“I will tell you; that’s perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don’t\nknow now why I did ask you to come. Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to\nsee me twice, since he came back from Moscow. First time he came as a\nfriend to call on me, and the second time Katya was here and he came\nbecause he heard she was here. I didn’t, of course, expect him to come\noften, knowing what a lot he has to do as it is, _vous comprenez, cette\naffaire et la mort terrible de votre papa_. But I suddenly heard he’d\nbeen here again, not to see me but to see Lise. That’s six days ago\nnow. He came, stayed five minutes, and went away. And I didn’t hear of\nit till three days afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to\nme. I sent for Lise directly. She laughed. ‘He thought you were\nasleep,’ she said, ‘and came in to me to ask after your health.’ Of\ncourse, that’s how it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us, how she\ndistresses me! Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just\nafter you saw her last time, and had gone away, she suddenly had a fit,\nscreaming, shrieking, hysterics! Why is it I never have hysterics?\nThen, next day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and\nyesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She suddenly\nscreamed out, ‘I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch. I insist on your never letting\nhim come to the house again.’ I was struck dumb at these amazing words,\nand answered, ‘On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent\nyoung man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?’—for\nall this business is a misfortune, isn’t it? She suddenly burst out\nlaughing at my words, and so rudely, you know. Well, I was pleased; I\nthought I had amused her and the fits would pass off, especially as I\nwanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his\nstrange visits without my knowledge, and meant to ask him for an\nexplanation. But early this morning Lise waked up and flew into a\npassion with Yulia and, would you believe it, slapped her in the face.\nThat’s monstrous; I am always polite to my servants. And an hour later\nshe was hugging Yulia’s feet and kissing them. She sent a message to me\nthat she wasn’t coming to me at all, and would never come and see me\nagain, and when I dragged myself down to her, she rushed to kiss me,\ncrying, and as she kissed me, she pushed me out of the room without\nsaying a word, so I couldn’t find out what was the matter. Now, dear\nAlexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my\nwhole life is in your hands. I simply beg you to go to Lise and find\nout everything from her, as you alone can, and come back and tell\nme—me, her mother, for you understand it will be the death of me,\nsimply the death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away. I\ncan stand no more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then\n... then something awful will happen. Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr\nIlyitch!” cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she saw Perhotin\nenter the room. “You are late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put\nus out of suspense. What does the counsel say. Where are you off to,\nAlexey Fyodorovitch?”",
            "12": "“To Lise.”\n\n“Oh, yes. You won’t forget, you won’t forget what I asked you? It’s a\nquestion of life and death!”\n\n“Of course, I won’t forget, if I can ... but I am so late,” muttered\nAlyosha, beating a hasty retreat.\n\n“No, be sure, be sure to come in; don’t say ‘If you can.’ I shall die\nif you don’t,” Madame Hohlakov called after him, but Alyosha had\nalready left the room."

She did not\nmove to meet him, but her sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his\nface. There was a feverish look in her eyes, her face was pale and\nyellow. Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in\nthree days. She was positively thinner. She did not hold out her hand\nto him. He touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her\ndress, then he sat down facing her, without a word.\n\n“I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,” Lise said curtly,\n“and mamma’s kept you there for hours; she’s just been telling you\nabout me and Yulia.”\n\n“How do you know?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“I’ve been listening. Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do\nlisten, there’s no harm in that. I don’t apologize.”\n\n“You are upset about something?”\n\n“On the contrary, I am very happy. I’ve only just been reflecting for\nthe thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not\nbe your wife. You are not fit to be a husband. If I were to marry you\nand give you a note to take to the man I loved after you, you’d take it\nand be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back, too. If you\nwere forty, you would still go on taking my love‐letters for me.”\n\nShe suddenly laughed.\n\n“There is something spiteful and yet open‐hearted about you,” Alyosha\nsmiled to her.\n\n“The open‐heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with\nyou. What’s more, I don’t want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.\nAlyosha, why is it I don’t respect you? I am very fond of you, but I\ndon’t respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn’t talk to you without\nshame, should I?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?”\n\n“No, I don’t believe it.”\n\nLise laughed nervously again; she spoke rapidly.\n\n“I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison.\nAlyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for\nhaving so quickly allowed me not to love you.”\n\n“Why did you send for me to‐day, Lise?”\n\n“I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to\ntorture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away. I\ndon’t want to be happy.”\n\n“You are in love with disorder?”",
            "1": "“Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house. I keep\nimagining how I’ll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it\nmust be on the sly. They’ll try to put it out, but it’ll go on burning.\nAnd I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness! And how bored I\nam!”\n\nShe waved her hand with a look of repulsion.\n\n“It’s your luxurious life,” said Alyosha, softly.\n\n“Is it better, then, to be poor?”\n\n“Yes, it is better.”\n\n“That’s what your monk taught you. That’s not true. Let me be rich and\nall the rest poor, I’ll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to\nany one else. Ach, don’t speak, don’t say anything,” she shook her hand\nat him, though Alyosha had not opened his mouth. “You’ve told me all\nthat before, I know it all by heart. It bores me. If I am ever poor, I\nshall murder somebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one,\nperhaps—why do nothing! But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the\nrye? I’ll marry you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant;\nwe’ll keep a colt, shall we? Do you know Kalganov?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is always wandering about, dreaming.

One can dream the most delightful things,\nbut real life is a bore.’ But he’ll be married soon for all that; he’s\nbeen making love to me already. Can you spin tops?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, he’s just like a top: he wants to be wound up and set spinning\nand then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip. If I marry him, I’ll\nkeep him spinning all his life. You are not ashamed to be with me?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You are awfully cross, because I don’t talk about holy things. I don’t\nwant to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the\ngreatest sin? You must know all about that.”\n\n“God will censure you.” Alyosha was watching her steadily.\n\n“That’s just what I should like. I would go up and they would censure\nme, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully\nlike to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don’t\nbelieve me?”\n\n“Why? There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set\nfire to something and they do set things on fire, too. It’s a sort of\ndisease.”\n\n“That’s not true, that’s not true; there may be children, but that’s\nnot what I mean.”\n\n“You take evil for good; it’s a passing crisis, it’s the result of your\nillness, perhaps.”\n\n“You do despise me, though! It’s simply that I don’t want to do good, I\nwant to do evil, and it has nothing to do with illness.”\n\n“Why do evil?”",
            "2": "“So that everything might be destroyed. Ah, how nice it would be if\neverything were destroyed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of\ndoing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for\na long while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out. Every\none will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at\nthem all. That would be awfully nice. Why would it be so nice,\nAlyosha?”\n\n“I don’t know. It’s a craving to destroy something good or, as you say,\nto set fire to something. It happens sometimes.”\n\n“I not only say it, I shall do it.”\n\n“I believe you.”\n\n“Ah, how I love you for saying you believe me. And you are not lying\none little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on\npurpose to annoy you?”\n\n“No, I don’t think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to\ndo that in it, too.”\n\n“There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,” she declared, with a\nstrange fire in her eyes.\n\nWhat struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness. There was not\na trace of humor or jesting in her face now, though, in old days, fun\nand gayety never deserted her even at her most “earnest” moments.\n\n“There are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully.\n\n“Yes, yes! You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one\nloves crime, they love it always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, it’s\nas though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied\nabout it ever since. They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly\nthey all love it.”\n\n“And are you still reading nasty books?”\n\n“Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I\nsteal them.”\n\n“Aren’t you ashamed to destroy yourself?”\n\n“I want to destroy myself. There’s a boy here, who lay down between the\nrailway lines when the train was passing. Lucky fellow! Listen, your\nbrother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves\nhis having killed his father.”\n\n“Loves his having killed his father?”\n\n“Yes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it’s so awful, but\nsecretly they simply love it. I for one love it.”\n\n“There is some truth in what you say about every one,” said Alyosha\nsoftly.",
            "3": "“Oh, what ideas you have!” Lise shrieked in delight. “And you a monk,\ntoo! You wouldn’t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling\nlies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of\ndevils. It’s night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there\nare devils all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and\nthey open the doors; there’s a crowd of them behind the doors and they\nwant to come and seize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me.\nBut I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back, though they don’t\ngo away altogether, they stand at the doors and in the corners,\nwaiting. And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud,\nand so I begin, and then they come crowding back to me, delighted, and\nseize me again and I cross myself again and they all draw back. It’s\nawful fun. it takes one’s breath away.”\n\n“I’ve had the same dream, too,” said Alyosha suddenly.\n\n“Really?” cried Lise, surprised. “I say, Alyosha, don’t laugh, that’s\nawfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?”\n\n“It seems they can.”\n\n“Alyosha, I tell you, it’s awfully important,” Lise went on, with\nreally excessive amazement. “It’s not the dream that’s important, but\nyour having the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don’t lie now:\nis it true? You are not laughing?”\n\n“It’s true.”\n\nLise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was\nsilent.\n\n“Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,” she said\nsuddenly, in a supplicating voice.\n\n“I’ll always come to see you, all my life,” answered Alyosha firmly.\n\n“You are the only person I can talk to, you know,” Lise began again. “I\ntalk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to\nyou more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you,\nnot a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha,\nis it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“There’s a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took\na child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and\nthen crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified\nhim, and afterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died\nsoon, within four hours. That was ‘soon’! He said the child moaned,\nkept on moaning and he stood admiring it. That’s nice!”\n\n“Nice?”",
            "4": "“Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him. He would\nhang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple\n_compote_. I am awfully fond of pineapple _compote_. Do you like it?”\n\nAlyosha looked at her in silence. Her pale, sallow face was suddenly\ncontorted, her eyes burned.\n\n“You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. I\nkept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned (a child of four\nyears old understands, you know), and all the while the thought of\npineapple _compote_ haunted me. In the morning I wrote a letter to a\ncertain person, begging him _particularly_ to come and see me. He came\nand I suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple\n_compote_. _All_ about it, _all_, and said that it was nice. He laughed\nand said it really was nice. Then he got up and went away. He was only\nhere five minutes. Did he despise me? Did he despise me? Tell me, tell\nme, Alyosha, did he despise me or not?” She sat up on the couch, with\nflashing eyes.\n\n“Tell me,” Alyosha asked anxiously, “did you send for that person?”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“Did you send him a letter?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Simply to ask about that, about that child?”\n\n“No, not about that at all. But when he came, I asked him about that at\nonce. He answered, laughed, got up and went away.”\n\n“That person behaved honorably,” Alyosha murmured.\n\n“And did he despise me? Did he laugh at me?”\n\n“No, for perhaps he believes in the pineapple _compote_ himself. He is\nvery ill now, too, Lise.”\n\n“Yes, he does believe in it,” said Lise, with flashing eyes.\n\n“He doesn’t despise any one,” Alyosha went on. “Only he does not\nbelieve any one. If he doesn’t believe in people, of course, he does\ndespise them.”\n\n“Then he despises me, me?”\n\n“You, too.”\n\n“Good,” Lise seemed to grind her teeth. “When he went out laughing, I\nfelt that it was nice to be despised. The child with fingers cut off is\nnice, and to be despised is nice....”\n\nAnd she laughed in Alyosha’s face, a feverish malicious laugh.\n\n“Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like—Alyosha, save me!”\nShe suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him and seized him with\nboth hands. “Save me!” she almost groaned. “Is there any one in the\nworld I could tell what I’ve told you? I’ve told you the truth, the\ntruth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe everything! I don’t want\nto live, because I loathe everything! I loathe everything, everything.\nAlyosha, why don’t you love me in the least?” she finished in a frenzy.",
            "5": "“But I do love you!” answered Alyosha warmly.\n\n“And will you weep over me, will you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Not because I won’t be your wife, but simply weep for me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Thank you! It’s only your tears I want. Every one else may punish me\nand trample me under foot, every one, every one, not excepting _any\none_. For I don’t love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the\ncontrary, I hate him! Go, Alyosha; it’s time you went to your brother”;\nshe tore herself away from him suddenly.\n\n“How can I leave you like this?” said Alyosha, almost in alarm.\n\n“Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here’s your hat. Give\nmy love to Mitya, go, go!”\n\nAnd she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He looked at\nher with pained surprise, when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his\nright hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed. He glanced at it\nand instantly read the address, “To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.” He\nlooked quickly at Lise. Her face had become almost menacing.\n\n“Give it to him, you must give it to him!” she ordered him, trembling\nand beside herself. “To‐day, at once, or I’ll poison myself! That’s why\nI sent for you.”\n\nAnd she slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Alyosha put the\nnote in his pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to\nMadame Hohlakov; forgetting her, in fact. As soon as Alyosha had gone,\nLise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack\nand slammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger. Ten\nseconds after, releasing her finger, she walked softly, slowly to her\nchair, sat up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened\nfinger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail. Her lips were\nquivering and she kept whispering rapidly to herself:\n\n“I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!”"

            "0": "It was quite late (days are short in November) when Alyosha rang at the\nprison gate. It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he\nwould be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little\ntown, as everywhere else. At first, of course, on the conclusion of the\npreliminary inquiry, relations and a few other persons could only\nobtain interviews with Mitya by going through certain inevitable\nformalities. But later, though the formalities were not relaxed,\nexceptions were made for some, at least, of Mitya’s visitors. So much\nso, that sometimes the interviews with the prisoner in the room set\naside for the purpose were practically _tête‐à‐tête_.",
            "1": "These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha\nand Rakitin were treated like this. But the captain of the police,\nMihail Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. His\nabuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man’s conscience, and when he\nlearned the whole story, he completely changed his view of her. And\nstrange to say, though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt, yet after\nMitya was once in prison, the old man came to take a more and more\nlenient view of him. “He was a man of good heart, perhaps,” he thought,\n“who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation.” His first horror\nhad been succeeded by pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was very\nfond of him and had known him for a long time. Rakitin, who had of late\ntaken to coming very often to see the prisoner, was one of the most\nintimate acquaintances of the “police captain’s young ladies,” as he\ncalled them, and was always hanging about their house. He gave lessons\nin the house of the prison superintendent, too, who, though scrupulous\nin the performance of his duties, was a kind‐ hearted old man. Alyosha,\nagain, had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the\nsuperintendent, who was fond of talking to him, generally on sacred\nsubjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe of his\nopinion, though he was a great philosopher himself; “self‐ taught,” of\ncourse. But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him. During the\nlast year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and\nconstantly talked over his impressions with his young friend. He used\nto come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours together\nwith him and with the monks. So even if Alyosha were late at the\nprison, he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made\neasy. Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder,\nhad grown used to Alyosha. The sentry, of course, did not trouble him\nso long as the authorities were satisfied.",
            "2": "When Mitya was summoned from his cell, he always went downstairs, to\nthe place set aside for interviews. As Alyosha entered the room he came\nupon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both\ntalking loudly. Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out, while\nRakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha,\nespecially of late. He scarcely spoke to him, and bowed to him stiffly.\nSeeing Alyosha enter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were\nentirely absorbed in buttoning his big, warm, fur‐trimmed overcoat.\nThen he began looking at once for his umbrella.\n\n“I must mind not to forget my belongings,” he muttered, simply to say\nsomething.\n\n“Mind you don’t forget other people’s belongings,” said Mitya, as a\njoke, and laughed at once at his own wit. Rakitin fired up instantly.\n\n“You’d better give that advice to your own family, who’ve always been a\nslave‐driving lot, and not to Rakitin,” he cried, suddenly trembling\nwith anger.\n\n“What’s the matter? I was joking,” cried Mitya. “Damn it all! They are\nall like that,” he turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin’s\nhurriedly retreating figure. “He was sitting here, laughing and\ncheerful, and all at once he boils up like that. He didn’t even nod to\nyou. Have you broken with him completely? Why are you so late? I’ve not\nbeen simply waiting, but thirsting for you the whole morning. But never\nmind. We’ll make up for it now.”\n\n“Why does he come here so often? Surely you are not such great\nfriends?” asked Alyosha. He, too, nodded at the door through which\nRakitin had disappeared.\n\n“Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that. Is it likely—a\npig like that? He considers I am ... a blackguard. They can’t\nunderstand a joke either, that’s the worst of such people. They never\nunderstand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind\nme of prison walls when I was first brought here. But he is a clever\nfellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it’s all over with me now.”\n\nHe sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him.\n\n“Yes, the trial’s to‐morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?” Alyosha\nsaid, with an apprehensive feeling.",
            "3": "“What are you talking about?” said Mitya, looking at him rather\nuncertainly. “Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we’ve been\ntalking of things that don’t matter, about this trial, but I haven’t\nsaid a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to‐morrow;\nbut it wasn’t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me.\nWhy do you look at me so critically?”\n\n“What do you mean, Mitya?”\n\n“Ideas, ideas, that’s all! Ethics! What is ethics?”\n\n“Ethics?” asked Alyosha, wondering.\n\n“Yes; is it a science?”\n\n“Yes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can’t explain to\nyou what sort of science it is.”\n\n“Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He’s not going to be a\nmonk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he’ll go in for criticism of\nan elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own\ncareer, too. Ough! they are first‐rate, these people, at making a\ncareer! Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I\nlove you more than any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who\nwas Karl Bernard?”\n\n“Karl Bernard?” Alyosha was surprised again.\n\n“No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he?\nChemist or what?”\n\n“He must be a savant,” answered Alyosha; “but I confess I can’t tell\nyou much about him, either. I’ve heard of him as a savant, but what\nsort I don’t know.”\n\n“Well, damn him, then! I don’t know either,” swore Mitya. “A scoundrel\nof some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will\nmake his way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he is another Bernard. Ugh,\nthese Bernards! They are all over the place.”\n\n“But what is the matter?” Alyosha asked insistently.",
            "4": "“He wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his\nliterary career. That’s what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants\nto prove some theory. He wants to say ‘he couldn’t help murdering his\nfather, he was corrupted by his environment,’ and so on. He explained\nit all to me. He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he says. But\nthere, damn the fellow, he can put in a tinge if he likes, I don’t\ncare. He can’t bear Ivan, he hates him. He’s not fond of you, either.\nBut I don’t turn him out, for he is a clever fellow. Awfully conceited,\nthough. I said to him just now, ‘The Karamazovs are not blackguards,\nbut philosophers; for all true Russians are philosophers, and though\nyou’ve studied, you are not a philosopher—you are a low fellow.’ He\nlaughed, so maliciously. And I said to him, ‘_De ideabus non est\ndisputandum_.’ Isn’t that rather good? I can set up for being a\nclassic, you see!” Mitya laughed suddenly.\n\n“Why is it all over with you? You said so just now,” Alyosha\ninterposed.\n\n“Why is it all over with me? H’m!... The fact of it is ... if you take\nit as a whole, I am sorry to lose God—that’s why it is.”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘sorry to lose God’?”\n\n“Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head—that is, these nerves are\nthere in the brain ... (damn them!) there are sort of little tails, the\nlittle tails of those nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering ...\nthat is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin\nquivering, those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image\nappears ... it doesn’t appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes\n... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a\nmoment—devil take the moment!—but an image; that is, an object, or an\naction, damn it! That’s why I see and then think, because of those\ntails, not at all because I’ve got a soul, and that I am some sort of\nimage and likeness. All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to\nme yesterday, brother, and it simply bowled me over. It’s magnificent,\nAlyosha, this science! A new man’s arising—that I understand.... And\nyet I am sorry to lose God!”\n\n“Well, that’s a good thing, anyway,” said Alyosha.",
            "5": "“That I am sorry to lose God? It’s chemistry, brother, chemistry!\nThere’s no help for it, your reverence, you must make way for\nchemistry. And Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn’t he dislike Him!\nThat’s the sore point with all of them. But they conceal it. They tell\nlies. They pretend. ‘Will you preach this in your reviews?’ I asked\nhim. ‘Oh, well, if I did it openly, they won’t let it through,’ he\nsaid. He laughed. ‘But what will become of men then?’ I asked him,\n‘without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do\nwhat they like?’ ‘Didn’t you know?’ he said laughing, ‘a clever man can\ndo what he likes,’ he said. ‘A clever man knows his way about, but\nyou’ve put your foot in it, committing a murder, and now you are\nrotting in prison.’ He says that to my face! A regular pig! I used to\nkick such people out, but now I listen to them. He talks a lot of\nsense, too. Writes well. He began reading me an article last week. I\ncopied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.”\n\nMitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read:\n\n“ ‘In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to\nput one’s personality in contradiction to one’s reality.’ Do you\nunderstand that?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” said Alyosha. He looked at Mitya and listened to him\nwith curiosity.\n\n“I don’t understand either. It’s dark and obscure, but intellectual.\n‘Every one writes like that now,’ he says, ‘it’s the effect of their\nenvironment.’ They are afraid of the environment. He writes poetry,\ntoo, the rascal. He’s written in honor of Madame Hohlakov’s foot. Ha ha\nha!”\n\n“I’ve heard about it,” said Alyosha.\n\n“Have you? And have you heard the poem?”\n\n“No.”",
            "6": "“I’ve got it. Here it is. I’ll read it to you. You don’t know—I haven’t\ntold you—there’s quite a story about it. He’s a rascal! Three weeks ago\nhe began to tease me. ‘You’ve got yourself into a mess, like a fool,\nfor the sake of three thousand, but I’m going to collar a hundred and\nfifty thousand. I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in\nPetersburg.’ And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov. She hadn’t\nmuch brains in her youth, and now at forty she has lost what she had.\n‘But she’s awfully sentimental,’ he says; ‘that’s how I shall get hold\nof her. When I marry her, I shall take her to Petersburg and there I\nshall start a newspaper.’ And his mouth was simply watering, the beast,\nnot for the widow, but for the hundred and fifty thousand. And he made\nme believe it. He came to see me every day. ‘She is coming round,’ he\ndeclared. He was beaming with delight. And then, all of a sudden, he\nwas turned out of the house. Perhotin’s carrying everything before him,\nbravo! I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him out of the\nhouse. And he had written this doggerel. ‘It’s the first time I’ve\nsoiled my hands with writing poetry,’ he said. ‘It’s to win her heart,\nso it’s in a good cause. When I get hold of the silly woman’s fortune,\nI can be of great social utility.’ They have this social justification\nfor every nasty thing they do! ‘Anyway it’s better than your Pushkin’s\npoetry,’ he said, ‘for I’ve managed to advocate enlightenment even in\nthat.’ I understand what he means about Pushkin, I quite see that, if\nhe really was a man of talent and only wrote about women’s feet. But\nwasn’t Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel! The vanity of these\nfellows! ‘On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my\naffections’—he thought of that for a title. He’s a waggish fellow.\n\nA captivating little foot,\nThough swollen and red and tender!\nThe doctors come and plasters put,\nBut still they cannot mend her.\n\nYet, ’tis not for her foot I dread—\nA theme for Pushkin’s muse more fit—\nIt’s not her foot, it is her head:\nI tremble for her loss of wit!\n\nFor as her foot swells, strange to say,\nHer intellect is on the wane—\nOh, for some remedy I pray\nThat may restore both foot and brain!\n\n\nHe is a pig, a regular pig, but he’s very arch, the rascal! And he\nreally has put in a progressive idea. And wasn’t he angry when she\nkicked him out! He was gnashing his teeth!”\n\n“He’s taken his revenge already,” said Alyosha. “He’s written a\nparagraph about Madame Hohlakov.”",
            "7": "And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_.\n\n“That’s his doing, that’s his doing!” Mitya assented, frowning. “That’s\nhim! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have\nbeen written about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too....\nH’m!”\n\nHe walked across the room with a harassed air.\n\n“Brother, I cannot stay long,” Alyosha said, after a pause. “To‐morrow\nwill be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be\naccomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I\ndon’t know what ...”\n\n“No, don’t be amazed at me,” Mitya broke in warmly. “Am I to talk of\nthat stinking dog? Of the murderer? We’ve talked enough of him. I don’t\nwant to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will\nkill him, you will see. Hush!”\n\nHe went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed.",
            "8": "“Rakitin wouldn’t understand it,” he began in a sort of exaltation;\n“but you, you’ll understand it all. That’s why I was thirsting for you.\nYou see, there’s so much I’ve been wanting to tell you for ever so\nlong, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven’t said a word about\nwhat matters most; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait\nno longer. I must pour out my heart to you. Brother, these last two\nmonths I’ve found in myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. He\nwas hidden in me, but would never have come to the surface, if it\nhadn’t been for this blow from heaven. I am afraid! And what do I care\nif I spend twenty years in the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? I am\nnot a bit afraid of that—it’s something else I am afraid of now: that\nthat new man may leave me. Even there, in the mines, under‐ground, I\nmay find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side, and\nI may make friends with him, for even there one may live and love and\nsuffer. One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict, one may\nwait upon him for years, and at last bring up from the dark depths a\nlofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one may bring forth an\nangel, create a hero! There are so many of them, hundreds of them, and\nwe are all to blame for them. Why was it I dreamed of that ‘babe’ at\nsuch a moment? ‘Why is the babe so poor?’ That was a sign to me at that\nmoment. It’s for the babe I’m going. Because we are all responsible for\nall. For all the ‘babes,’ for there are big children as well as little\nchildren. All are ‘babes.’ I go for all, because some one must go for\nall. I didn’t kill father, but I’ve got to go. I accept it. It’s all\ncome to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are numbers of\nthem there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their hands.\nOh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but then,\nin our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man\ncannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy: it’s His privilege—a\ngrand one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be\nunderground there without God? Rakitin’s laughing! If they drive God\nfrom the earth, we shall shelter Him underground. One cannot exist in\nprison without God; it’s even more impossible than out of prison. And\nthen we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a\nglorious hymn to God, with Whom is joy. Hail to God and His joy! I love\nHim!”",
            "9": "Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech. He\nturned pale, his lips quivered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n“Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,” he began again.\n“You wouldn’t believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst\nfor existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these\npeeling walls. Rakitin doesn’t understand that; all he cares about is\nbuilding a house and letting flats. But I’ve been longing for you. And\nwhat is suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond\nreckoning. I am not afraid of it now. I was afraid of it before. Do you\nknow, perhaps I won’t answer at the trial at all.... And I seem to have\nsuch strength in me now, that I think I could stand anything, any\nsuffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment,\n‘I exist.’ In thousands of agonies—I exist. I’m tormented on the\nrack—but I exist! Though I sit alone on a pillar—I exist! I see the\nsun, and if I don’t see the sun, I know it’s there. And there’s a whole\nlife in that, in knowing that the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all\nthese philosophies are the death of me. Damn them! Brother Ivan—”\n\n“What of brother Ivan?” interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear.",
            "10": "“You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden\naway in me. It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were\nsurging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage. It was to\nstifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not\nRakitin, there is an idea in him. Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he is\nalways silent. It’s God that’s worrying me. That’s the only thing\nthat’s worrying me. What if He doesn’t exist? What if Rakitin’s\nright—that it’s an idea made up by men? Then if He doesn’t exist, man\nis the chief of the earth, of the universe. Magnificent! Only how is he\ngoing to be good without God? That’s the question. I always come back\nto that. For whom is man going to love then? To whom will he be\nthankful? To whom will he sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says\nthat one can love humanity without God. Well, only a sniveling idiot\ncan maintain that. I can’t understand it. Life’s easy for Rakitin.\n‘You’d better think about the extension of civic rights, or even of\nkeeping down the price of meat. You will show your love for humanity\nmore simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.’ I answered him,\n‘Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of\nmeat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every copeck.’ He lost his\ntemper. But after all, what is goodness? Answer me that, Alexey.\nGoodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it’s a\nrelative thing. Or isn’t it? Is it not relative? A treacherous\nquestion! You won’t laugh if I tell you it’s kept me awake two nights.\nI only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.\nVanity! Ivan has no God. He has an idea. It’s beyond me. But he is\nsilent. I believe he is a free‐mason. I asked him, but he is silent. I\nwanted to drink from the springs of his soul—he was silent. But once he\ndid drop a word.”\n\n“What did he say?” Alyosha took it up quickly.\n\n“I said to him, ‘Then everything is lawful, if it is so?’ He frowned.\n‘Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,’ he said, ‘was a pig, but his ideas were\nright enough.’ That was what he dropped. That was all he said. That was\ngoing one better than Rakitin.”\n\n“Yes,” Alyosha assented bitterly. “When was he with you?”",
            "11": "“Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing\nabout Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last. When my business\nhere is over and the verdict has been given, then I’ll tell you\nsomething. I’ll tell you everything. We’ve something tremendous on\nhand.... And you shall be my judge in it. But don’t begin about that\nnow; be silent. You talk of to‐morrow, of the trial; but, would you\nbelieve it, I know nothing about it.”\n\n“Have you talked to the counsel?”\n\n“What’s the use of the counsel? I told him all about it. He’s a soft,\ncity‐bred rogue—a Bernard! But he doesn’t believe me—not a bit of it.\nOnly imagine, he believes I did it. I see it. ‘In that case,’ I asked\nhim, ‘why have you come to defend me?’ Hang them all! They’ve got a\ndoctor down, too, want to prove I’m mad. I won’t have that! Katerina\nIvanovna wants to do her ‘duty’ to the end, whatever the strain!” Mitya\nsmiled bitterly. “The cat! Hard‐hearted creature! She knows that I said\nof her at Mokroe that she was a woman of ‘great wrath.’ They repeated\nit. Yes, the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the\nsea. Grigory sticks to his point. Grigory’s honest, but a fool. Many\npeople are honest because they are fools: that’s Rakitin’s idea.\nGrigory’s my enemy. And there are some people who are better as foes\nthan friends. I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I am afraid\nshe will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand.\nShe’ll pay it back to the last farthing. I don’t want her sacrifice;\nthey’ll put me to shame at the trial. I wonder how I can stand it. Go\nto her, Alyosha, ask her not to speak of that in the court, can’t you?\nBut damn it all, it doesn’t matter! I shall get through somehow. I\ndon’t pity her. It’s her own doing. She deserves what she gets. I shall\nhave my own story to tell, Alexey.” He smiled bitterly again. “Only ...\nonly Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such suffering to\nbear?” he exclaimed suddenly, with tears. “Grusha’s killing me; the\nthought of her’s killing me, killing me. She was with me just now....”\n\n“She told me she was very much grieved by you to‐day.”\n\n“I know. Confound my temper! It was jealousy. I was sorry, I kissed her\nas she was going. I didn’t ask her forgiveness.”\n\n“Why didn’t you?” exclaimed Alyosha.\n\nSuddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully.",
            "12": "“God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a\nfault from a woman you love. From one you love especially, however\ngreatly you may have been in fault. For a woman—devil only knows what\nto make of a woman! I know something about them, anyway. But try\nacknowledging you are in fault to a woman. Say, ‘I am sorry, forgive\nme,’ and a shower of reproaches will follow! Nothing will make her\nforgive you simply and directly, she’ll humble you to the dust, bring\nforward things that have never happened, recall everything, forget\nnothing, add something of her own, and only then forgive you. And even\nthe best, the best of them do it. She’ll scrape up all the scrapings\nand load them on your head. They are ready to flay you alive, I tell\nyou, every one of them, all these angels without whom we cannot live! I\ntell you plainly and openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be\nunder some woman’s thumb. That’s my conviction—not conviction, but\nfeeling. A man ought to be magnanimous, and it’s no disgrace to a man!\nNo disgrace to a hero, not even a Cæsar! But don’t ever beg her pardon\nall the same for anything. Remember that rule given you by your brother\nMitya, who’s come to ruin through women. No, I’d better make it up to\nGrusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship her, Alexey, worship\nher. Only she doesn’t see it. No, she still thinks I don’t love her\nenough. And she tortures me, tortures me with her love. The past was\nnothing! In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers that\ntortured me, but now I’ve taken all her soul into my soul and through\nher I’ve become a man myself. Will they marry us? If they don’t, I\nshall die of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she\nsay to you about me?”\n\nAlyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya\nlistened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased.\n\n“Then she is not angry at my being jealous?” he exclaimed. “She is a\nregular woman! ‘I’ve a fierce heart myself!’ Ah, I love such fierce\nhearts, though I can’t bear any one’s being jealous of me. I can’t\nendure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her\ninfinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That’s the\nquestion. And without her I can’t exist....”\n\nMitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly\nseemed terribly worried.",
            "13": "“So there’s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against\nher, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka,\nthat’s not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine\nway. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I’ll tell you our secret!”\n\nHe looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing\nbefore him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in\nreality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the\ncorner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.",
            "14": "“I will tell you all our secret,” Mitya whispered hurriedly. “I meant\nto tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You\nare everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are\nmy angel. It’s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it’s you that is\nsuperior and not Ivan. You see, it’s a question of conscience, question\nof the higher conscience—the secret is so important that I can’t settle\nit myself, and I’ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway\nit’s too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon\nas the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don’t decide it now.\nI’ll tell you now. You listen, but don’t decide. Stand and keep quiet.\nI won’t tell you everything. I’ll only tell you the idea, without\ndetails, and you keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree?\nBut, goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I’m afraid your eyes\nwill tell me your decision, even if you don’t speak. Oo! I’m afraid!\nAlyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my _escaping_. I won’t tell you the\ndetails: it’s all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don’t\ndecide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can’t live\nwithout Grusha! What if they won’t let her follow me to Siberia? Do\nthey let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what\nshould I do there underground with a hammer? I should only smash my\nskull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I should\nhave run away from suffering. A sign has come, I reject the sign. I\nhave a way of salvation and I turn my back on it. Ivan says that in\nAmerica, ‘with the good‐will,’ I can be of more use than underground.\nBut what becomes of our hymn from underground? What’s America? America\nis vanity again! And there’s a lot of swindling in America, too, I\nexpect. I should have run away from crucifixion! I tell you, you know,\nAlexey, because you are the only person who can understand this.\nThere’s no one else. It’s folly, madness to others, all I’ve told you\nof the hymn. They’ll say I’m out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of\nmy mind and I am not a fool. Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He\nunderstands, only he doesn’t answer—he doesn’t speak. He doesn’t\nbelieve in the hymn. Don’t speak, don’t speak. I see how you look! You\nhave already decided. Don’t decide, spare me! I can’t live without\nGrusha. Wait till after the trial!”",
            "15": "Mitya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha with both hands on his\nshoulders, and his yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his brother’s.\n\n“They don’t let convicts marry, do they?” he repeated for the third\ntime in a supplicating voice.\n\nAlyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.\n\n“Tell me one thing,” he said. “Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea\nwas it?”\n\n“His, his, and he is very keen on it. He didn’t come to see me at\nfirst, then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight\naway. He is awfully keen on it. He doesn’t ask me, but orders me to\nescape. He doesn’t doubt of my obeying him, though I showed him all my\nheart as I have to you, and told him about the hymn, too. He told me\nhe’d arrange it; he’s found out about everything. But of that later.\nHe’s simply set on it. It’s all a matter of money: he’ll pay ten\nthousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for America. And he\nsays we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand.”\n\n“And he told you on no account to tell me?” Alyosha asked again.\n\n“To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He\nis afraid, no doubt, that you’ll stand before me as my conscience.\nDon’t tell him I told you. Don’t tell him, for anything.”\n\n“You are right,” Alyosha pronounced; “it’s impossible to decide\nanything before the trial is over. After the trial you’ll decide of\nyourself. Then you’ll find that new man in yourself and he will\ndecide.”\n\n“A new man, or a Bernard who’ll decide _à la_ Bernard, for I believe\nI’m a contemptible Bernard myself,” said Mitya, with a bitter grin.\n\n“But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?”\n\nMitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head. “Alyosha,\ndarling, it’s time you were going,” he said, with a sudden haste.\n“There’s the superintendent shouting in the yard. He’ll be here\ndirectly. We are late; it’s irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me!\nSign me with the cross, darling, for the cross I have to bear\nto‐morrow.”\n\nThey embraced and kissed.\n\n“Ivan,” said Mitya suddenly, “suggests my escaping; but, of course, he\nbelieves I did it.”\n\nA mournful smile came on to his lips.\n\n“Have you asked him whether he believes it?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“No, I haven’t. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t the courage. But\nI saw it from his eyes. Well, good‐by!”\n\nOnce more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when\nMitya suddenly called him back.",
            "16": "“Stand facing me! That’s right!” And again he seized Alyosha, putting\nboth hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so\nthat it was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness.\nHis lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha.\n\n“Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you\nbelieve I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole\ntruth, don’t lie!” he cried desperately.\n\nEverything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a\nstab at his heart.\n\n“Hush! What do you mean?” he faltered helplessly.\n\n“The whole truth, the whole, don’t lie!” repeated Mitya.\n\n“I’ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!” broke\nin a shaking voice from Alyosha’s breast, and he raised his right hand\nin the air, as though calling God to witness his words.\n\nMitya’s whole face was lighted up with bliss.\n\n“Thank you!” he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him\nafter fainting. “Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it,\ntill this moment I’ve been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go!\nYou’ve given me strength for to‐morrow. God bless you! Come, go along!\nLove Ivan!” was Mitya’s last word.\n\nAlyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of\nconfidence even to him, to Alyosha—all this suddenly opened before\nAlyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul\nof his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him\ninstantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. “Love Ivan!”—he\nsuddenly recalled Mitya’s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly\nwanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about\nMitya, and more than ever now."

            "0": "On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was\nliving. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and\nresolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a\nweek. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on\nthe eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which\nwas dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and\nas they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming\nfrom Katerina Ivanovna.\n\n“Ah, it’s only you,” said Ivan dryly. “Well, good‐by! You are going to\nher?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I don’t advise you to; she’s upset and you’ll upset her more.”\n\nA door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly:\n\n“No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?”\n\n“Yes, I have been with him.”\n\n“Has he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan\nFyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?”\n\nThere was such a peremptory note in Katya’s voice that Ivan, after a\nmoment’s hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha.\n\n“She was listening,” he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard\nit.\n\n“Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,” said Ivan, going into the drawing‐\nroom. “I won’t sit down. I won’t stay more than a minute.”\n\n“Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” said Katerina Ivanovna, though she\nremained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but\nthere was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered\nafterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that\nmoment.\n\n“What did he ask you to tell me?”\n\n“Only one thing,” said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, “that\nyou would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what” (he was\na little confused) “... passed between you ... at the time of your\nfirst acquaintance ... in that town.”\n\n“Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!” She broke into a\nbitter laugh. “Why, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to\nspare—whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!”\n\nAlyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her.\n\n“Both yourself and him,” he answered softly.\n\n“I am glad to hear it,” she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly\nblushed.\n\n“You don’t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,” she said menacingly. “And\nI don’t know myself yet. Perhaps you’ll want to trample me under foot\nafter my examination to‐morrow.”\n\n“You will give your evidence honorably,” said Alyosha; “that’s all\nthat’s wanted.”",
            "1": "“Women are often dishonorable,” she snarled. “Only an hour ago I was\nthinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a\nreptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it?\nIs he the murderer?” she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning\nquickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that\nquestion before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for\nthe first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by\nquarreling.\n\n“I’ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that\nhe murdered his father. It’s only you I believed!” she continued, still\naddressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started\nat her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.\n\n“Well, that’s enough, anyway,” Ivan cut short the conversation. “I am\ngoing. I’ll come to‐morrow.” And turning at once, he walked out of the\nroom and went straight downstairs.\n\nWith an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both\nhands.\n\n“Follow him! Overtake him! Don’t leave him alone for a minute!” she\nsaid, in a hurried whisper. “He’s mad! Don’t you know that he’s mad? He\nis in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so. Go, run after\nhim....”\n\nAlyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of\nhim.\n\n“What do you want?” He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was\nrunning after him. “She told you to catch me up, because I’m mad. I\nknow it all by heart,” he added irritably.\n\n“She is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,” said\nAlyosha. “I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill,\nIvan.”\n\nIvan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him.\n\n“And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their\nmind?” Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of\nirritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.\n\n“No, I don’t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.”\n\n“And can one observe that one’s going mad oneself?”\n\n“I imagine one can’t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,”\nAlyosha answered with surprise.\n\nIvan paused for half a minute.\n\n“If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,” he said\nsuddenly.\n\n“Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,” said Alyosha\ntimidly, and he took Lise’s note from his pocket and held it out to\nIvan. They were just under a lamp‐post. Ivan recognized the handwriting\nat once.",
            "2": "“Ah, from that little demon!” he laughed maliciously, and, without\nopening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The\nbits were scattered by the wind.\n\n“She’s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,” he\nsaid contemptuously, striding along the street again.\n\n“How do you mean, offering herself?” exclaimed Alyosha.\n\n“As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure.”\n\n“How can you, Ivan, how can you?” Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved\nvoice. “She is a child; you are insulting a child! She is ill; she is\nvery ill, too. She is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had\nhoped to hear something from you ... that would save her.”\n\n“You’ll hear nothing from me. If she is a child I am not her nurse. Be\nquiet, Alexey. Don’t go on about her. I am not even thinking about it.”\n\nThey were silent again for a moment.\n\n“She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how\nto act to‐morrow at the trial,” he said sharply and angrily again.\n\n“You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?”\n\n“Yes. Whether she’s to save Mitya or ruin him. She’ll pray for light\nfrom above. She can’t make up her mind for herself, you see. She has\nnot had time to decide yet. She takes me for her nurse, too. She wants\nme to sing lullabies to her.”\n\n“Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,” said Alyosha sadly.\n\n“Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her.”\n\n“She is suffering. Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give\nher hope?” Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. “I know that you’ve\ngiven her hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,” he added.\n\n“I can’t behave to her as I ought—break off altogether and tell her so\nstraight out,” said Ivan, irritably. “I must wait till sentence is\npassed on the murderer. If I break off with her now, she will avenge\nherself on me by ruining that scoundrel to‐morrow at the trial, for she\nhates him and knows she hates him. It’s all a lie—lie upon lie! As long\nas I don’t break off with her, she goes on hoping, and she won’t ruin\nthat monster, knowing how I want to get him out of trouble. If only\nthat damned verdict would come!”\n\nThe words “murderer” and “monster” echoed painfully in Alyosha’s heart.\n\n“But how can she ruin Mitya?” he asked, pondering on Ivan’s words.\n“What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya?”\n\n“You don’t know that yet. She’s got a document in her hands, in Mitya’s\nown writing, that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor\nPavlovitch.”\n\n“That’s impossible!” cried Alyosha.",
            "3": "“Why is it impossible? I’ve read it myself.”\n\n“There can’t be such a document!” Alyosha repeated warmly. “There can’t\nbe, because he’s not the murderer. It’s not he murdered father, not\nhe!”\n\nIvan suddenly stopped.\n\n“Who is the murderer then, according to you?” he asked, with apparent\ncoldness. There was even a supercilious note in his voice.\n\n“You know who,” Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice.\n\n“Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic,\nSmerdyakov?”\n\nAlyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over.\n\n“You know who,” broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely breathe.\n\n“Who? Who?” Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his restraint suddenly\nvanished.\n\n“I only know one thing,” Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper,\n“_it wasn’t you_ killed father.”\n\n“ ‘Not you’! What do you mean by ‘not you’?” Ivan was thunderstruck.\n\n“It was not you killed father, not you!” Alyosha repeated firmly.\n\nThe silence lasted for half a minute.\n\n“I know I didn’t. Are you raving?” said Ivan, with a pale, distorted\nsmile. His eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under\na lamp‐post.\n\n“No, Ivan. You’ve told yourself several times that you are the\nmurderer.”\n\n“When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so?” Ivan\nfaltered helplessly.\n\n“You’ve said so to yourself many times, when you’ve been alone during\nthese two dreadful months,” Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as\nbefore. Yet he was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his\nown will, but obeying some irresistible command. “You have accused\nyourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and\nno one else. But you didn’t do it: you are mistaken: you are not the\nmurderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.”\n\nThey were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They\nwere both standing still, gazing into each other’s eyes. They were both\npale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha’s\nshoulder.\n\n“You’ve been in my room!” he whispered hoarsely. “You’ve been there at\nnight, when he came.... Confess ... have you seen him, have you seen\nhim?”\n\n“Whom do you mean—Mitya?” Alyosha asked, bewildered.\n\n“Not him, damn the monster!” Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. “Do you know\nthat he visits me? How did you find out? Speak!”\n\n“Who is _he_! I don’t know whom you are talking about,” Alyosha\nfaltered, beginning to be alarmed.\n\n“Yes, you do know ... or how could you—? It’s impossible that you don’t\nknow.”",
            "4": "Suddenly he seemed to check himself. He stood still and seemed to\nreflect. A strange grin contorted his lips.\n\n“Brother,” Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, “I have said this\nto you, because you’ll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once\nand for all, it’s not you. You hear, once for all! God has put it into\nmy heart to say this to you, even though it may make you hate me from\nthis hour.”\n\nBut by now Ivan had apparently regained his self‐control.\n\n“Alexey Fyodorovitch,” he said, with a cold smile, “I can’t endure\nprophets and epileptics—messengers from God especially—and you know\nthat only too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment\nand probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning. It’s the\nway to your lodgings, too. You’d better be particularly careful not to\ncome to me to‐day! Do you hear?”\n\nHe turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back.\n\n“Brother,” Alyosha called after him, “if anything happens to you\nto‐day, turn to me before any one!”\n\nBut Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp‐post at the cross\nroads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness. Then he turned and\nwalked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings;\nneither of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s empty house.\nAlyosha had a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan\nlived some distance from him. He had taken a roomy and fairly\ncomfortable lodge attached to a fine house that belonged to a\nwell‐to‐do lady, the widow of an official. But his only attendant was a\ndeaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six o’clock every\nevening and got up at six in the morning. Ivan had become remarkably\nindifferent to his comforts of late, and very fond of being alone. He\ndid everything for himself in the one room he lived in, and rarely\nentered any of the other rooms in his abode.",
            "5": "He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell, when he\nsuddenly stopped. He felt that he was trembling all over with anger.\nSuddenly he let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked\nwith rapid steps in the opposite direction. He walked a mile and a half\nto a tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya\nKondratyevna, the neighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\nkitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and\nplayed on the guitar, was now lodging. She had sold their little house,\nand was now living here with her mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill—almost\ndying—had been with them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch’s death. It was\nto him Ivan was going now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible\nprompting."

        "title": "VI.\nThe First Interview With Smerdyakov",
        "content": {
            "0": "This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his\nreturn from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him\nwas on the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more,\na fortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so\nthat it was now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely\nheard anything of him.\n\nIvan had only returned five days after his father’s death, so that he\nwas not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came\nback. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow\naddress, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and\nshe, not knowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and\naunt, reckoning on Ivan’s going to see them as soon as he arrived in\nMoscow. But he did not go to them till four days after his arrival.\nWhen he got the telegram, he had, of course, set off post‐haste to our\ntown. The first to meet him was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised\nto find that, in opposition to the general opinion of the town, he\nrefused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya, and spoke openly of\nSmerdyakov as the murderer. Later on, after seeing the police captain\nand the prosecutor, and hearing the details of the charge and the\narrest, he was still more surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his\nopinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with\nMitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very fond.\n\nBy the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan’s feeling to his brother\nDmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a\ncompassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost\nrepugnance. Mitya’s whole personality, even his appearance, was\nextremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina\nIvanovna’s love for his brother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first\nday of his arrival, and that interview, far from shaking Ivan’s belief\nin his guilt, positively strengthened it. He found his brother\nagitated, nervously excited. Mitya had been talkative, but very\nabsent‐minded and incoherent. He used violent language, accused\nSmerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked principally about the\nthree thousand roubles, which he said had been “stolen” from him by his\nfather.\n\n“The money was mine, it was my money,” Mitya kept repeating. “Even if I\nhad stolen it, I should have had the right.”",
            "1": "He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a\nfact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He\nhardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite\nthe contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against\nhim; he was continually firing up and abusing every one. He only\nlaughed contemptuously at Grigory’s evidence about the open door, and\ndeclared that it was “the devil that opened it.” But he could not bring\nforward any coherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in\ninsulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that\nit was not for people who declared that “everything was lawful,” to\nsuspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with\nIvan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya,\nIvan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov.\n\nIn the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of\nSmerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before\nhe went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But\nwhen he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said\nnothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he\nhad seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital.\n\nDoctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital,\nconfidently asserted in reply to Ivan’s persistent questions, that\nSmerdyakov’s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were\nsurprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming\non the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the\nattack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring\nseveral times, so that the patient’s life was positively in danger, and\nit was only now, after they had applied remedies, that they could\nassert with confidence that the patient would survive. “Though it might\nwell be,” added Doctor Herzenstube, “that his reason would be impaired\nfor a considerable period, if not permanently.” On Ivan’s asking\nimpatiently whether that meant that he was now mad, they told him that\nthis was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but that\ncertain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan decided to find out for\nhimself what those abnormalities were.",
            "2": "At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov\nwas lying on a truckle‐bed in a separate ward. There was only one other\nbed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with\ndropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he could be no hindrance to\ntheir conversation. Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and\nfor the first instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But\nthat was only momentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the\ncontrary, by Smerdyakov’s composure. From the first glance Ivan had no\ndoubt that he was very ill. He was very weak; he spoke slowly, seeming\nto move his tongue with difficulty; he was much thinner and sallower.\nThroughout the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he kept\ncomplaining of headache and of pain in all his limbs. His thin\nemasculate face seemed to have become so tiny; his hair was ruffled,\nand his crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft. But in the\nleft eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something,\nSmerdyakov showed himself unchanged. “It’s always worth while speaking\nto a clever man.” Ivan was reminded of that at once. He sat down on the\nstool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his\nposition in bed, but he was not the first to speak. He remained dumb,\nand did not even look much interested.\n\n“Can you talk to me?” asked Ivan. “I won’t tire you much.”\n\n“Certainly I can,” mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. “Has your\nhonor been back long?” he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a\nnervous visitor.\n\n“I only arrived to‐day.... To see the mess you are in here.”\n\nSmerdyakov sighed.\n\n“Why do you sigh? You knew of it all along,” Ivan blurted out.\n\nSmerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while.\n\n“How could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I\ntell it would turn out like that?”\n\n“What would turn out? Don’t prevaricate! You’ve foretold you’d have a\nfit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very\nspot.”\n\n“Have you said so at the examination yet?” Smerdyakov queried with\ncomposure.\n\nIvan felt suddenly angry.\n\n“No, I haven’t yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great\ndeal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play\nwith me!”\n\n“Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in\nGod Almighty?” said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a\nmoment closing his eyes.",
            "3": "“In the first place,” began Ivan, “I know that epileptic fits can’t be\ntold beforehand. I’ve inquired; don’t try and take me in. You can’t\nforetell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the\nhour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you\nwould fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn’t sham a fit on\npurpose?”\n\n“I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,”\nSmerdyakov drawled deliberately. “I fell from the garret just in the\nsame way a year ago. It’s quite true you can’t tell the day and hour of\na fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.”\n\n“But you did foretell the day and the hour!”\n\n“In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the\ndoctors here. You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham;\nit’s no use my saying any more about it.”\n\n“And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?”\n\n“You don’t seem able to get over that cellar! As I was going down to\nthe cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most\nwas losing you and being left without defense in all the world. So I\nwent down into the cellar thinking, ‘Here, it’ll come on directly,\nit’ll strike me down directly, shall I fall?’ And it was through this\nfear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went\nflying. All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate\nthe evening before, when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of\nthe cellar, I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay\nParfenovitch, the investigating lawyer, and it’s all been written down\nin the protocol. And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all\nof them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the\napprehension that I might fall. It was just then that the fit seized\nme. And so they’ve written it down, that it’s just how it must have\nhappened, simply from my fear.”\n\nAs he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.\n\n“Then you have said all that in your evidence?” said Ivan, somewhat\ntaken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating\ntheir conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already\nreported it all himself.\n\n“What have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,”\nSmerdyakov pronounced firmly.\n\n“And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?”\n\n“No, not to say every word.”\n\n“And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?”",
            "4": "“No, I didn’t tell them that either.”\n\n“Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?”\n\n“I was afraid you’d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.”\n\n“You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to\nget out of the way of trouble.”\n\n“That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you,\nforeseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare\nmyself even more. That’s why I told you to get out of harm’s way, that\nyou might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and\nwould remain at home to protect your father.”\n\n“You might have said it more directly, you blockhead!” Ivan suddenly\nfired up.\n\n“How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear\nthat made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well\nhave been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and\ncarry away that money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who\ncould tell that it would end in a murder like this? I thought that he\nwould only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master’s\nmattress in the envelope, and you see, he’s murdered him. How could you\nguess it either, sir?”\n\n“But if you say yourself that it couldn’t be guessed, how could I have\nguessed and stayed at home? You contradict yourself!” said Ivan,\npondering.\n\n“You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to\nMoscow.”\n\n“How could I guess it from that?”\n\nSmerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he was silent for a minute.\n\n“You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to\nMoscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for\nMoscow’s a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not\nfar off, would not be so bold. And if anything had happened, you might\nhave come to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory\nVassilyevitch’s illness, and that I was afraid of having a fit. And\nwhen I explained those knocks to you, by means of which one could go in\nto the deceased, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me,\nI thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do\nsomething, and so wouldn’t go to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.”\n\n“He talks very coherently,” thought Ivan, “though he does mumble;\nwhat’s the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of?”\n\n“You are cunning with me, damn you!” he exclaimed, getting angry.\n\n“But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,” Smerdyakov parried\nwith the simplest air.",
            "5": "“If I’d guessed, I should have stayed,” cried Ivan.\n\n“Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in\nsuch a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save\nyourself in your fright.”\n\n“You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?”\n\n“Forgive me, I thought you were like me.”\n\n“Of course, I ought to have guessed,” Ivan said in agitation; “and I\ndid guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are\nlying, you are lying again,” he cried, suddenly recollecting. “Do you\nremember how you went up to the carriage and said to me, ‘It’s always\nworth while speaking to a clever man’? So you were glad I went away,\nsince you praised me?”\n\nSmerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his face.\n\n“If I was pleased,” he articulated rather breathlessly, “it was simply\nbecause you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya. For it was\nnearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way\nof praise, but of reproach. You didn’t understand it.”\n\n“What reproach?”\n\n“Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and\nwould not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for\nstealing that three thousand.”\n\n“Damn you!” Ivan swore again. “Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and\nthe investigating lawyer about those knocks?”\n\n“I told them everything just as it was.”\n\nIvan wondered inwardly again.\n\n“If I thought of anything then,” he began again, “it was solely of some\nwickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would\nsteal—I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any\nwickedness from you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What\ndid you say that for?”\n\n“It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on\npurpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was\njust foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open‐hearted with\nyou.”\n\n“My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.”\n\n“What else is left for him to do?” said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.\n“And who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory\nVassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never\nmind him! He is trembling to save himself.”\n\nHe slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection,\nadded:",
            "6": "“And look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it\nis the work of my hands—I’ve heard that already. But as to my being\nclever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I\ncould sham one, if I really had had such a design against your father?\nIf I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as\nto give such evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too!\nUpon my word! Is that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has\nnever happened. No one hears this talk of ours now, except Providence\nitself, and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay\nParfenovitch you might defend me completely by doing so, for who would\nbe likely to be such a criminal, if he is so open‐hearted beforehand?\nAny one can see that.”\n\n“Well,” and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by\nSmerdyakov’s last argument. “I don’t suspect you at all, and I think\nit’s absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to\nyou for setting my mind at rest. Now I am going, but I’ll come again.\nMeanwhile, good‐by. Get well. Is there anything you want?”\n\n“I am very thankful for everything. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget\nme, and provides me anything I want, according to her kindness. Good\npeople visit me every day.”\n\n“Good‐by. But I shan’t say anything of your being able to sham a fit,\nand I don’t advise you to, either,” something made Ivan say suddenly.\n\n“I quite understand. And if you don’t speak of that, I shall say\nnothing of that conversation of ours at the gate.”\n\nThen it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he had gone a dozen\nsteps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there was an insulting\nsignificance in Smerdyakov’s last words. He was almost on the point of\nturning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering,\n“Nonsense!” he went out of the hospital.",
            "7": "His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not\nSmerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he might\nhave been expected to feel the opposite. He did not want to analyze the\nreason for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying\ninto his sensations. He felt as though he wanted to make haste to\nforget something. In the following days he became convinced of Mitya’s\nguilt, as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him. There\nwas evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for\ninstance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin,\nthe people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov’s shop, as well as the\nwitnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the\ndetails that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the\nlawyers almost as much as Grigory’s evidence as to the open door.\nGrigory’s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan’s questions, declared that\nSmerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition\nwall. “He was not three paces from our bed,” and that although she was\na sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, “He was\nmoaning the whole time, moaning continually.”\n\nTalking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov\nwas not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a\nsubtle smile.\n\n“Do you know how he spends his time now?” he asked; “learning lists of\nFrench words by heart. He has an exercise‐book under his pillow with\nthe French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he\nhe he!”\n\nIvan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri\nwithout repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha\npersisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that “in all\nprobability” Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha’s opinion\nmeant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another\nthing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to\ntalk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only\nanswered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly.",
            "8": "But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite\napart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself\nhopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This\nis not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan’s, which\nleft its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the\nsubject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I\ncannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina\nIvanovna with Alyosha, as I’ve related already, told him, “I am not\nkeen on her,” it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at\ntimes he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes\nhelped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with\nMitya, she rushed on Ivan’s return to meet him as her one salvation.\nShe was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man\nhad come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she\nknew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so\nsuperior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon\nherself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov\nviolence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her. She\nwas continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having\ndeserted Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger (and they\nwere numerous) she told Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to\nAlyosha “lies upon lies.” There was, of course, much that was false in\nit, and that angered Ivan more than anything.... But of all this later.\n\nHe did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov’s existence, and\nyet, a fortnight after his first visit to him, he began to be haunted\nby the same strange thoughts as before. It’s enough to say that he was\ncontinually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in\nFyodor Pavlovitch’s house he had crept out on to the stairs like a\nthief and listened to hear what his father was doing below? Why had he\nrecalled that afterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he been\nsuddenly so depressed on the journey? Why, as he reached Moscow, had he\nsaid to himself, “I am a scoundrel”? And now he almost fancied that\nthese tormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna,\nso completely did they take possession of him again. It was just after\nfancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at\nonce, and put a question to him:",
            "9": "“Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and\nafterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved ‘the right to\ndesire’?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father’s death\nor not?”\n\n“I did think so,” answered Alyosha, softly.\n\n“It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn’t you fancy\nthen that what I wished was just that ‘one reptile should devour\nanother’; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as\npossible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that\nabout?”\n\nAlyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother’s\nface.\n\n“Speak!” cried Ivan, “I want above everything to know what you thought\nthen. I want the truth, the truth!”\n\nHe drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer\ncame.\n\n“Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,” whispered Alyosha,\nand he did not add one softening phrase.\n\n“Thanks,” snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his\nway. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid\nhim and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that\nAlyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with\nhim, Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again."

        "content": {
            "0": "By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan\nknew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in\ntwo by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her\nmother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he\nlived with them, whether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed\nafterwards that he had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna’s\nbetrothed, and was living there for a time without paying for board or\nlodging. Both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and\nlooked upon him as greatly superior to themselves.\n\nIvan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the\npassage. By Marya Kondratyevna’s directions he went straight to the\nbetter room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled\nstove in the room and it was extremely hot. The walls were gay with\nblue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in the cracks under\nit cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a\ncontinual rustling from them. The furniture was very scanty: two\nbenches against each wall and two chairs by the table. The table of\nplain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it. There was\na pot of geranium on each of the two little windows. In the corner\nthere was a case of ikons. On the table stood a little copper samovar\nwith many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov had\nfinished tea and the samovar was out. He was sitting at the table on a\nbench. He was looking at an exercise‐book and slowly writing with a\npen. There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick, but\nwith a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov’s face that\nhe had completely recovered from his illness. His face was fresher,\nfuller, his hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at\nthe sides. He was sitting in a parti‐colored, wadded dressing‐gown,\nrather dirty and frayed, however. He had spectacles on his nose, which\nIvan had never seen him wearing before. This trifling circumstance\nsuddenly redoubled Ivan’s anger: “A creature like that and wearing\nspectacles!”",
            "1": "Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor\nthrough his spectacles; then he slowly took them off and rose from the\nbench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least\npossible required by common civility. All this struck Ivan instantly;\nhe took it all in and noted it at once—most of all the look in\nSmerdyakov’s eyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty. “What do\nyou want to intrude for?” it seemed to say; “we settled everything\nthen; why have you come again?” Ivan could scarcely control himself.\n\n“It’s hot here,” he said, still standing, and unbuttoned his overcoat.\n\n“Take off your coat,” Smerdyakov conceded.\n\nIvan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He\ntook a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down. Smerdyakov\nmanaged to sit down on his bench before him.\n\n“To begin with, are we alone?” Ivan asked sternly and impulsively. “Can\nthey overhear us in there?”\n\n“No one can hear anything. You’ve seen for yourself: there’s a\npassage.”\n\n“Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving\nthe hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming\nfits, you wouldn’t tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation\nat the gate? What do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by it? Were\nyou threatening me? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you?\nDo you suppose I am afraid of you?”\n\nIvan said this in a perfect fury, giving him to understand with obvious\nintention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to\nshow his cards. Smerdyakov’s eyes gleamed resentfully, his left eye\nwinked, and he at once gave his answer, with his habitual composure and\ndeliberation. “You want to have everything above‐board; very well, you\nshall have it,” he seemed to say.\n\n“This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you,\nknowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him to his\nfate, and that people mightn’t after that conclude any evil about your\nfeelings and perhaps of something else, too—that’s what I promised not\nto tell the authorities.”\n\nThough Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling\nhimself, yet there was something in his voice, determined and emphatic,\nresentful and insolently defiant. He stared impudently at Ivan. A mist\npassed before Ivan’s eyes for the first moment.\n\n“How? What? Are you out of your mind?”\n\n“I’m perfectly in possession of all my faculties.”",
            "2": "“Do you suppose I _knew_ of the murder?” Ivan cried at last, and he\nbrought his fist violently on the table. “What do you mean by\n‘something else, too’? Speak, scoundrel!”\n\nSmerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent\nstare.\n\n“Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that ‘something else, too’?”\n\n“The ‘something else’ I meant was that you probably, too, were very\ndesirous of your parent’s death.”\n\nIvan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder, so\nthat he fell back against the wall. In an instant his face was bathed\nin tears. Saying, “It’s a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,” he dried\nhis eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet\nweeping. A minute passed.\n\n“That’s enough! Leave off,” Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.\n“Don’t put me out of all patience.”\n\nSmerdyakov took the rag from his eyes. Every line of his puckered face\nreflected the insult he had just received.\n\n“So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant\nto kill my father?”\n\n“I didn’t know what thoughts were in your mind then,” said Smerdyakov\nresentfully; “and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on\nthat very point.”\n\n“To sound what, what?”\n\n“Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be\nmurdered or not.”\n\nWhat infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent\ntone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.\n\n“It was you murdered him?” he cried suddenly.\n\nSmerdyakov smiled contemptuously.\n\n“You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn’t I murdered him. And I\nshould have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak\nof it again.”\n\n“But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?”\n\n“As you know already, it was simply from fear. For I was in such a\nposition, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. I resolved to\nsound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother,\nthen the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a\nfly, too.”\n\n“Look here, you didn’t say that a fortnight ago.”\n\n“I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought\nyou’d understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible\nman you wouldn’t care to talk of it openly.”\n\n“What next! Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I\nhave done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?”",
            "3": "“As for the murder, you couldn’t have done that and didn’t want to, but\nas for wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did\nwant.”\n\n“And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted it;\nwhat grounds had I for wanting it?”\n\n“What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?” said Smerdyakov\nsarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. “Why, after your parent’s\ndeath there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and\nvery likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that\nlady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she would have had all his capital made\nover to her directly after the wedding, for she’s plenty of sense, so\nthat your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three\nof you. And were they far from a wedding, either? Not a hair’s‐breadth:\nthat lady had only to lift her little finger and he would have run\nafter her to church, with his tongue out.”\n\nIvan restrained himself with painful effort.\n\n“Very good,” he commented at last. “You see, I haven’t jumped up, I\nhaven’t knocked you down, I haven’t killed you. Speak on. So, according\nto you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him?”\n\n“How could you help reckoning on him? If he killed him, then he would\nlose all the rights of a nobleman, his rank and property, and would go\noff to exile; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and\nyour brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you’d each have not\nforty, but sixty thousand each. There’s not a doubt you did reckon on\nDmitri Fyodorovitch.”\n\n“What I put up with from you! Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on\nany one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I\ndid expect some wickedness from you ... at the time.... I remember my\nimpression!”\n\n“I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on\nme as well,” said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin. “So that it was\njust by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind.\nFor if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as\nsaid to me, ‘You can murder my parent, I won’t hinder you!’ ”\n\n“You scoundrel! So that’s how you understood it!”",
            "4": "“It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! You were meaning to go to\nMoscow and refused all your father’s entreaties to go to\nTchermashnya—and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at\nonce! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya? Since you went to\nTchermashnya with no reason, simply at my word, it shows that you must\nhave expected something from me.”\n\n“No, I swear I didn’t!” shouted Ivan, grinding his teeth.\n\n“You didn’t? Then you ought, as your father’s son, to have had me taken\nto the lock‐up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least,\nto have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a\nbit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my\nfoolish word and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to\nhave stayed to save your parent’s life. How could I help drawing my\nconclusions?”\n\nIvan sat scowling, both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees.\n\n“Yes, I am sorry I didn’t punch you in the face,” he said with a bitter\nsmile. “I couldn’t have taken you to the lock‐up just then. Who would\nhave believed me and what charge could I bring against you? But the\npunch in the face ... oh, I’m sorry I didn’t think of it. Though blows\nare forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.”\n\nSmerdyakov looked at him almost with relish.\n\n“In the ordinary occasions of life,” he said in the same complacent and\nsententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him\nabout religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch’s table, “in the ordinary occasions\nof life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people\nhave given them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still\nfly to blows, not only among us but all over the world, be it even the\nfullest Republic of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and\nthey never will leave off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did\nnot dare.”\n\n“What are you learning French words for?” Ivan nodded towards the\nexercise‐book lying on the table.\n\n“Why shouldn’t I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing\nthat I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of\nEurope?”\n\n“Listen, monster.” Ivan’s eyes flashed and he trembled all over. “I am\nnot afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and\nif I don’t beat you to death, it’s simply because I suspect you of that\ncrime and I’ll drag you to justice. I’ll unmask you.”",
            "5": "“To my thinking, you’d better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me\nof, considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only\nif you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.”\n\n“Do you think I am afraid of you now?”\n\n“If the court doesn’t believe all I’ve said to you just now, the public\nwill, and you will be ashamed.”\n\n“That’s as much as to say, ‘It’s always worth while speaking to a\nsensible man,’ eh?” snarled Ivan.\n\n“You hit the mark, indeed. And you’d better be sensible.”\n\nIvan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and\nwithout replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him,\nwalked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him.\nThere was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations\nfilled his soul. “Shall I go at once and give information against\nSmerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway.\nOn the contrary, he’ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for\nTchermashnya then? What for? What for?” Ivan asked himself. “Yes, of\ncourse, I was expecting something and he is right....” And he\nremembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his\nfather’s house, he had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now\nwith such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been\nstabbed. “Yes, I expected it then, that’s true! I wanted the murder, I\ndid want the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill\nSmerdyakov! If I don’t dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth\nliving!”\n\nIvan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and\nalarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all\nhis conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn’t be\ncalmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the\nroom, speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his\nelbows on the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this\nstrange sentence: “If it’s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who’s the\nmurderer, I share his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I\ndon’t know yet. But if he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of\ncourse, I am the murderer, too.”",
            "6": "When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a\nword, went to her writing‐table, opened a box standing on it, took out\na sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of\nwhich Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a “conclusive proof” that\nDmitri had killed his father. It was the letter written by Mitya to\nKaterina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha\nat the crossroads on the way to the monastery, after the scene at\nKaterina Ivanovna’s, when Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting\nfrom Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka. I don’t know whether he\nsaw her, but in the evening he was at the “Metropolis,” where he got\nthoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document\nof weighty consequences to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected,\nfrantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a\ndrunken man, who, on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat\ntelling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted,\nwhat a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the\nother hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at\ngreat length, with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears\nand blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of\nordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern\nand there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently\nnot space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled\nthe margins but had written the last line right across the rest. The\nletter ran as follows:",
            "7": "FATAL KATYA: To‐morrow I will get the money and repay your three\nthousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my\nlove! Let us make an end! To‐morrow I shall try and get it from every\none, and if I can’t borrow it, I give you my word of honor I shall go\nto my father and break his skull and take the money from under the\npillow, if only Ivan has gone. If I have to go to Siberia for it, I’ll\ngive you back your three thousand. And farewell. I bow down to the\nground before you, for I’ve been a scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No,\nbetter not forgive me, you’ll be happier and so shall I! Better Siberia\nthan your love, for I love another woman and you got to know her too\nwell to‐day, so how can you forgive? I will murder the man who’s robbed\nme! I’ll leave you all and go to the East so as to see no one again.\nNot _her_ either, for you are not my only tormentress; she is too.\nFarewell!\n    P.S.—I write my curse, but I adore you! I hear it in my heart. One\n    string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I\n    shall kill myself, but first of all that cur. I shall tear three\n    thousand from him and fling it to you. Though I’ve been a scoundrel\n    to you, I am not a thief! You can expect three thousand. The cur\n    keeps it under his mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a thief, but\n    I’ll murder my thief. Katya, don’t look disdainful. Dmitri is not a\n    thief! but a murderer! He has murdered his father and ruined\n    himself to hold his ground, rather than endure your pride. And he\n    doesn’t love you.\n    P.P.S.—I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.—Katya, pray to God that\n    some one’ll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in gore,\n    and if no one does—I shall! Kill me!\n\n\nYour slave and enemy,\nD. KARAMAZOV.",
            "8": "\nWhen Ivan read this “document” he was convinced. So then it was his\nbrother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This\nletter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There\ncould be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya’s guilt. The suspicion\nnever occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the\nmurder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did\nnot fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next\nmorning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A\nfew days later he positively wondered how he could have been so\nhorribly distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with\ncontempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry\nabout Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill\nand out of his mind.\n\n“He’ll end in madness,” the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him,\nand Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan\nhimself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor\nwho had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And\njust at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely\nstrained. They were like two enemies in love with one another. Katerina\nIvanovna’s “returns” to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent\nrevulsions of feeling in his favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy.\nStrange to say, until that last scene described above, when Alyosha\ncame from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan had never once, during that\nmonth, heard her express a doubt of Mitya’s guilt, in spite of those\n“returns” that were so hateful to him. It is remarkable, too, that\nwhile he felt that he hated Mitya more and more every day, he realized\nthat it was not on account of Katya’s “returns” that he hated him, but\njust _because he was the murderer of his father_. He was conscious of\nthis and fully recognized it to himself.",
            "9": "Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and\nproposed to him a plan of escape—a plan he had obviously thought over a\nlong time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left\nin his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov’s, that it was to his, Ivan’s,\nadvantage that his brother should be convicted, as that would increase\nhis inheritance and Alyosha’s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He\ndetermined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya’s escape. On\nhis return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he\nsuddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya’s escape, not only\nto heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another\nreason. “Is it because I am as much a murderer at heart?” he asked\nhimself. Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his\nsoul. His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that\nlater....\n\nWhen, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with\nhis hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a\nsudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how\nKaterina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha’s presence:\n“It was you, you, persuaded me of his” (that is, Mitya’s) “guilt!” Ivan\nwas thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to\npersuade her that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had\nsuspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from\nSmerdyakov. It was _she_, she, who had produced that “document” and\nproved his brother’s guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: “I’ve been\nat Smerdyakov’s myself!” When had she been there? Ivan had known\nnothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya’s guilt! And what\ncould Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her? His\nheart burned with violent anger. He could not understand how he could,\nhalf an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried out\nat the moment. He let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov. “I\nshall kill him, perhaps, this time,” he thought on the way."

            "0": "When he was half‐way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing\nearly that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling\nthickly. It did not lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the\nwind, and soon there was a regular snowstorm. There were scarcely any\nlamp‐posts in the part of the town where Smerdyakov lived. Ivan strode\nalone in the darkness, unconscious of the storm, instinctively picking\nout his way. His head ached and there was a painful throbbing in his\ntemples. He felt that his hands were twitching convulsively. Not far\nfrom Marya Kondratyevna’s cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary\ndrunken little peasant. He was wearing a coarse and patched coat, and\nwas walking in zigzags, grumbling and swearing to himself. Then\nsuddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice:\n\n“Ach, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;\nI won’t wait till he comes back.”\n\n\nBut he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing\nagain; then he would begin the same song again. Ivan felt an intense\nhatred for him before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he\nrealized his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him\ndown. At that moment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch\nfell full tilt against Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. The peasant\nwent flying backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground. He\nuttered one plaintive “O—oh!” and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to\nhim. He was lying on his back, without movement or consciousness. “He\nwill be frozen,” thought Ivan, and he went on his way to Smerdyakov’s.\n\nIn the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with a\ncandle in her hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, “It’s not\nthat he’s laid up, but he seems not himself, and he even told us to\ntake the tea away; he wouldn’t have any.”\n\n“Why, does he make a row?” asked Ivan coarsely.\n\n“Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he’s very quiet. Only please don’t\ntalk to him too long,” Marya Kondratyevna begged him. Ivan opened the\ndoor and stepped into the room.",
            "1": "It was over‐heated as before, but there were changes in the room. One\nof the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been\nput a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up,\nwith fairly clean white pillows. Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa,\nwearing the same dressing‐gown. The table had been brought out in front\nof the sofa, so that there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a\nthick book in yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He\nseemed to be sitting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent\ngaze, and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was\na great change in his face; he was much thinner and sallower. His eyes\nwere sunken and there were blue marks under them.\n\n“Why, you really are ill?” Ivan stopped short. “I won’t keep you long,\nI won’t even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?”\n\nHe went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down on\nit.\n\n“Why do you look at me without speaking? I’ve only come with one\nquestion, and I swear I won’t go without an answer. Has the young lady,\nKaterina Ivanovna, been with you?”\n\nSmerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before.\nSuddenly, with a motion of his hand, he turned his face away.\n\n“What’s the matter with you?” cried Ivan.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘nothing’?”\n\n“Yes, she has. It’s no matter to you. Let me alone.”\n\n“No, I won’t let you alone. Tell me, when was she here?”\n\n“Why, I’d quite forgotten about her,” said Smerdyakov, with a scornful\nsmile, and turning his face to Ivan again, he stared at him with a look\nof frenzied hatred, the same look that he had fixed on him at their\nlast interview, a month before.\n\n“You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don’t look like\nyourself,” he said to Ivan.\n\n“Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.”\n\n“But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow. Are you\nso worried?” He smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright.\n\n“Listen; I’ve told you I won’t go away without an answer!” Ivan cried,\nintensely irritated.\n\n“Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?” said Smerdyakov,\nwith a look of suffering.\n\n“Damn it! I’ve nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and I’ll\ngo away.”\n\n“I’ve no answer to give you,” said Smerdyakov, looking down again.\n\n“You may be sure I’ll make you answer!”",
            "2": "“Why are you so uneasy?” Smerdyakov stared at him, not simply with\ncontempt, but almost with repulsion. “Is this because the trial begins\nto‐ morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can’t you believe that at last?\nGo home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don’t be afraid of anything.”\n\n“I don’t understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to‐morrow?”\nIvan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear\ndid in fact pass over his soul. Smerdyakov measured him with his eyes.\n\n“You don’t understand?” he drawled reproachfully. “It’s a strange thing\na sensible man should care to play such a farce!”\n\nIvan looked at him speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious\ntone of this man who had once been his valet, was extraordinary in\nitself. He had not taken such a tone even at their last interview.\n\n“I tell you, you’ve nothing to be afraid of. I won’t say anything about\nyou; there’s no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling!\nWhy are your fingers moving like that? Go home, _you_ did not murder\nhim.”\n\nIvan started. He remembered Alyosha.\n\n“I know it was not I,” he faltered.\n\n“Do you?” Smerdyakov caught him up again.\n\nIvan jumped up and seized him by the shoulder.\n\n“Tell me everything, you viper! Tell me everything!”\n\nSmerdyakov was not in the least scared. He only riveted his eyes on\nIvan with insane hatred.\n\n“Well, it was you who murdered him, if that’s it,” he whispered\nfuriously.\n\nIvan sank back on his chair, as though pondering something. He laughed\nmalignantly.\n\n“You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?”\n\n“You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you\nunderstand it now.”\n\n“All I understand is that you are mad.”\n\n“Aren’t you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what’s the use of\ngoing on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to\nthrow it all on me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real\nmurderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was\nfollowing your words I did it.”\n\n“_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?” Ivan turned cold.\n\nSomething seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over\nwith a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly;\nprobably the genuineness of Ivan’s horror struck him.\n\n“You don’t mean to say you really did not know?” he faltered\nmistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still\ngazed at him, and seemed unable to speak.\n\nAch, Vanka’s gone to Petersburg;\nI won’t wait till he comes back,",
            "3": "\nsuddenly echoed in his head.\n\n“Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting\nbefore me,” he muttered.\n\n“There’s no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he is\nhere, that third, between us.”\n\n“Who is he? Who is here? What third person?” Ivan cried in alarm,\nlooking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner.\n\n“That third is God Himself—Providence. He is the third beside us now.\nOnly don’t look for Him, you won’t find Him.”\n\n“It’s a lie that you killed him!” Ivan cried madly. “You are mad, or\nteasing me again!”\n\nSmerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign of fear. He\ncould still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still fancied that\nIvan knew everything and was trying to “throw it all on him to his\nface.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing\nup his left leg from under the table, he began turning up his trouser\nleg. He was wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he took\noff his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking. Ivan gazed at\nhim, and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror.\n\n“He’s mad!” he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that he\nknocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and\nstraight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirely\nunaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in his stocking, as though\nhe were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and\npull it out. At last he got hold of it and began pulling it out. Ivan\nsaw that it was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers.\nSmerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table.\n\n“Here,” he said quietly.\n\n“What is it?” asked Ivan, trembling.\n\n“Kindly look at it,” Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.\n\nIvan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began\nunfolding it, but suddenly he drew back his fingers, as though from\ncontact with a loathsome reptile.\n\n“Your hands keep twitching,” observed Smerdyakov, and he deliberately\nunfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets of\nhundred‐rouble notes.\n\n“They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not count\nthem. Take them,” Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes.\nIvan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief.\n\n“You frightened me ... with your stocking,” he said, with a strange\ngrin.\n\n“Can you really not have known till now?” Smerdyakov asked once more.",
            "4": "“No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!”\nHe suddenly clutched his head in both hands.\n\n“Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother’s help or without?”\n\n“It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri\nFyodorovitch is quite innocent.”\n\n“All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling?\nI can’t speak properly.”\n\n“You were bold enough then. You said ‘everything was lawful,’ and how\nfrightened you are now,” Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. “Won’t you\nhave some lemonade? I’ll ask for some at once. It’s very refreshing.\nOnly I must hide this first.”\n\nAnd again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get up and\ncall at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring\nit them, but, looking for something to cover up the notes that she\nmight not see them, he first took out his handkerchief, and as it\nturned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had\nnoticed at first lying on the table, and put it over the notes. The\nbook was _The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian_. Ivan read\nit mechanically.\n\n“I won’t have any lemonade,” he said. “Talk of me later. Sit down and\ntell me how you did it. Tell me all about it.”\n\n“You’d better take off your greatcoat, or you’ll be too hot.” Ivan, as\nthough he’d only just thought of it, took off his coat, and, without\ngetting up from his chair, threw it on the bench.\n\n“Speak, please, speak.”\n\nHe seemed calmer. He waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell\nhim _all_ about it.\n\n“How it was done?” sighed Smerdyakov. “It was done in a most natural\nway, following your very words.”\n\n“Of my words later,” Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete\nself‐ possession, firmly uttering his words, and not shouting as\nbefore. “Only tell me in detail how you did it. Everything, as it\nhappened. Don’t forget anything. The details, above everything, the\ndetails, I beg you.”\n\n“You’d gone away, then I fell into the cellar.”\n\n“In a fit or in a sham one?”\n\n“A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. I went quietly down the steps\nto the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a\nscream, and struggled, till they carried me out.”\n\n“Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the\nhospital?”\n\n“No, not at all. Next day, in the morning, before they took me to the\nhospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than I’ve had for\nyears. For two days I was quite unconscious.”\n\n“All right, all right. Go on.”",
            "5": "“They laid me on the bed. I knew I’d be the other side of the\npartition, for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me\nthere, near them. She’s always been very kind to me, from my birth up.\nAt night I moaned, but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to\ncome.”\n\n“Expecting him? To come to you?”\n\n“Not to me. I expected him to come into the house, for I’d no doubt\nthat he’d come that night, for being without me and getting no news,\nhe’d be sure to come and climb over the fence, as he used to, and do\nsomething.”\n\n“And if he hadn’t come?”\n\n“Then nothing would have happened. I should never have brought myself\nto it without him.”\n\n“All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don’t hurry; above\nall, don’t leave anything out!”\n\n“I expected him to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain,\nfor I had prepared him for it ... during the last few days.... He knew\nabout the knocks, that was the chief thing. With his suspiciousness and\nthe fury which had been growing in him all those days, he was bound to\nget into the house by means of those taps. That was inevitable, so I\nwas expecting him.”\n\n“Stay,” Ivan interrupted; “if he had killed him, he would have taken\nthe money and carried it away; you must have considered that. What\nwould you have got by it afterwards? I don’t see.”\n\n“But he would never have found the money. That was only what I told\nhim, that the money was under the mattress. But that wasn’t true. It\nhad been lying in a box. And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor\nPavlovitch, as I was the only person he trusted, to hide the envelope\nwith the notes in the corner behind the ikons, for no one would have\nguessed that place, especially if they came in a hurry. So that’s where\nthe envelope lay, in the corner behind the ikons. It would have been\nabsurd to keep it under the mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked.\nBut all believe it was under the mattress. A stupid thing to believe.\nSo if Dmitri Fyodorovitch had committed the murder, finding nothing, he\nwould either have run away in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always\nhappens with murderers, or he would have been arrested. So I could\nalways have clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money\nnext morning or even that night, and it would have all been put down to\nDmitri Fyodorovitch. I could reckon upon that.”\n\n“But what if he did not kill him, but only knocked him down?”",
            "6": "“If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured to take\nthe money, and nothing would have happened. But I calculated that he\nwould beat him senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and\nthen I’d make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one but Dmitri\nFyodorovitch who had taken the money after beating him.”\n\n“Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed\nhim; you only took the money?”\n\n“No, he didn’t kill him. Well, I might as well have told you now that\nhe was the murderer.... But I don’t want to lie to you now, because ...\nbecause if you really haven’t understood till now, as I see for myself,\nand are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very\nface, you are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the\nmurder and charged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it. And\nso I want to prove to your face this evening that you are the only real\nmurderer in the whole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I\ndid kill him. You are the rightful murderer.”\n\n“Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!” Ivan cried, unable to restrain\nhimself at last, and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself\ntill the end of the conversation. “You still mean that Tchermashnya?\nStay, tell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took\nTchermashnya for consent? How will you explain that now?”\n\n“Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn’t have\nmade an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if I’d been\nsuspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his accomplice; on the\ncontrary, you would have protected me from others.... And when you got\nyour inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all the\nrest of your life. For you’d have received your inheritance through me,\nseeing that if he had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn’t have\nhad a farthing.”\n\n“Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,” snarled\nIvan. “And what if I hadn’t gone away then, but had informed against\nyou?”",
            "7": "“What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to\nTchermashnya? That’s all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you\nwould either have gone away or have stayed. If you had stayed, nothing\nwould have happened. I should have known that you didn’t want it done,\nand should have attempted nothing. As you went away, it meant you\nassured me that you wouldn’t dare to inform against me at the trial,\nand that you’d overlook my having the three thousand. And, indeed, you\ncouldn’t have prosecuted me afterwards, because then I should have told\nit all in the court; that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed\nhim—I shouldn’t have said that—but that you’d put me up to the theft\nand the murder, though I didn’t consent to it. That’s why I needed your\nconsent, so that you couldn’t have cornered me afterwards, for what\nproof could you have had? I could always have cornered you, revealing\nyour eagerness for your father’s death, and I tell you the public would\nhave believed it all, and you would have been ashamed for the rest of\nyour life.”\n\n“Was I then so eager, was I?” Ivan snarled again.\n\n“To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my\ndoing it.” Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He was very weak and\nspoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him on. He\nevidently had some design. Ivan felt that.\n\n“Go on,” he said. “Tell me what happened that night.”",
            "8": "“What more is there to tell! I lay there and I thought I heard the\nmaster shout. And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up\nand came out, and he suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence\nand darkness. I lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldn’t bear\nit. I got up at last, went out. I saw the window open on the left into\nthe garden, and I stepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting\nthere alive, and I heard the master moving about, sighing, so I knew he\nwas alive. ‘Ech!’ I thought. I went to the window and shouted to the\nmaster, ‘It’s I.’ And he shouted to me, ‘He’s been, he’s been; he’s run\naway.’ He meant Dmitri Fyodorovitch had been. ‘He’s killed Grigory!’\n‘Where?’ I whispered. ‘There, in the corner,’ he pointed. He was\nwhispering, too. ‘Wait a bit,’ I said. I went to the corner of the\ngarden to look, and there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by\nthe wall, covered with blood, senseless. So it’s true that Dmitri\nFyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that came into my head, and\nI determined on the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory\nVassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see nothing of it, as he\nlay there senseless. The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake\nup. I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came over\nme, till I could scarcely breathe. I went back to the window to the\nmaster and said, ‘She’s here, she’s come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has\ncome, wants to be let in.’ And he started like a baby. ‘Where is she?’\nhe fairly gasped, but couldn’t believe it. ‘She’s standing there,’ said\nI. ‘Open.’ He looked out of the window at me, half believing and half\ndistrustful, but afraid to open. ‘Why, he is afraid of me now,’ I\nthought. And it was funny. I bethought me to knock on the window‐frame\nthose taps we’d agreed upon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his\npresence, before his eyes. He didn’t seem to believe my word, but as\nsoon as he heard the taps, he ran at once to open the door. He opened\nit. I would have gone in, but he stood in the way to prevent me\npassing. ‘Where is she? Where is she?’ He looked at me, all of a\ntremble. ‘Well,’ thought I, ‘if he’s so frightened of me as all that,\nit’s a bad look out!’ And my legs went weak with fright that he\nwouldn’t let me in or would call out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up,\nor something else might happen. I don’t remember now, but I must have\nstood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, ‘Why, she’s there, there,\nunder the window; how is it you don’t see her?’ I said. ‘Bring her\nthen, bring her.’ ‘She’s afraid,’ said I; ‘she was frightened at the\nnoise, she’s hidden in the bushes; go and call to her yourself from the\nstudy.’ He ran to the window, put the candle in the window.\n‘Grushenka,’ he cried, ‘Grushenka, are you here?’ Though he cried that,\nhe didn’t want to lean out of the window, he didn’t want to move away\nfrom me, for he was panic‐stricken; he was so frightened he didn’t dare\nto turn his back on me. ‘Why, here she is,’ said I. I went up to the\nwindow and leaned right out of it. ‘Here she is; she’s in the bush,\nlaughing at you, don’t you see her?’ He suddenly believed it; he was\nall of a shake—he was awfully crazy about her—and he leaned right out\nof the window. I snatched up that iron paper‐weight from his table; do\nyou remember, weighing about three pounds? I swung it and hit him on\nthe top of the skull with the corner of it. He didn’t even cry out. He\nonly sank down suddenly, and I hit him again and a third time. And the\nthird time I knew I’d broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back,\nface upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on\nme, not a spot. I wiped the paper‐weight, put it back, went up to the\nikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on\nthe floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out into the garden all\nof a tremble, straight to the apple‐tree with a hollow in it—you know\nthat hollow. I’d marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of\npaper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it\ndeep down in the hole. And there it stayed for over a fortnight. I took\nit out later, when I came out of the hospital. I went back to my bed,\nlay down and thought, ‘If Grigory Vassilyevitch has been killed\noutright it may be a bad job for me, but if he is not killed and\nrecovers, it will be first‐rate, for then he’ll bear witness that\nDmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he must have killed him and\ntaken the money.’ Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience,\nso as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last she got up\nand she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not\nthere, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden. And that set\nit all going and set my mind at rest.”",
            "9": "He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without\nstirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story Smerdyakov\nglanced at him from time to time, but for the most part kept his eyes\naverted. When he had finished he was evidently agitated and was\nbreathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his face. But it was\nimpossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling, or what.\n\n“Stay,” cried Ivan, pondering. “What about the door? If he only opened\nthe door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before? For\nGrigory saw it before you went.”\n\nIt was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone,\nnot angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment\nand peeped in at them, he would certainly have concluded that they were\ntalking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.\n\n“As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch’s having seen it open,\nthat’s only his fancy,” said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile. “He is not a\nman, I assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn’t see it, but fancied\nhe had seen it, and there’s no shaking him. It’s just our luck he took\nthat notion into his head, for they can’t fail to convict Dmitri\nFyodorovitch after that.”\n\n“Listen ...” said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making\nan effort to grasp something. “Listen. There are a lot of questions I\nwant to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting\nmixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and\nleave it there on the floor? Why didn’t you simply carry off the\nenvelope?... When you were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as\nthough it were the right thing to do ... but why, I can’t\nunderstand....”",
            "10": "“I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all about it, as\nI did for instance, if he’d seen those notes before, and perhaps had\nput them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up\nand addressed, with his own eyes, if such a man had done the murder,\nwhat should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards, especially\nin such desperate haste, since he’d know for certain the notes must be\nin the envelope? No, if the robber had been some one like me, he’d\nsimply have put the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with\nit as fast as he could. But it’d be quite different with Dmitri\nFyodorovitch. He only knew about the envelope by hearsay; he had never\nseen it, and if he’d found it, for instance, under the mattress, he’d\nhave torn it open as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were in\nit. And he’d have thrown the envelope down, without having time to\nthink that it would be evidence against him. Because he was not an\nhabitual thief and had never directly stolen anything before, for he is\na gentleman born, and if he did bring himself to steal, it would not be\nregular stealing, but simply taking what was his own, for he’d told the\nwhole town he meant to before, and had even bragged aloud before every\none that he’d go and take his property from Fyodor Pavlovitch. I didn’t\nsay that openly to the prosecutor when I was being examined, but quite\nthe contrary, I brought him to it by a hint, as though I didn’t see it\nmyself, and as though he’d thought of it himself and I hadn’t prompted\nhim; so that Mr. Prosecutor’s mouth positively watered at my\nsuggestion.”\n\n“But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?” cried\nIvan, overcome with astonishment. He looked at Smerdyakov again with\nalarm.\n\n“Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry?\nIt was all thought out beforehand.”\n\n“Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!” Ivan cried again. “No,\nyou are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....”\n\nHe got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He was in\nterrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was\nhardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only turned\nround where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of\nmoving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as\nbefore.",
            "11": "“Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don’t you understand\nthat if I haven’t killed you, it’s simply because I am keeping you to\nanswer to‐morrow at the trial. God sees,” Ivan raised his hand,\n“perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for\nmy father’s ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think,\nand perhaps I didn’t urge you on at all. No, no, I didn’t urge you on!\nBut no matter, I will give evidence against myself to‐morrow at the\ntrial. I’m determined to! I shall tell everything, everything. But\nwe’ll make our appearance together. And whatever you may say against me\nat the trial, whatever evidence you give, I’ll face it; I am not afraid\nof you. I’ll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too! You\nmust, you must; we’ll go together. That’s how it shall be!”\n\nIvan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone\nit could be seen that it would be so.\n\n“You are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,”\nSmerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy\nin fact.\n\n“We’ll go together,” Ivan repeated. “And if you won’t go, no matter,\nI’ll go alone.”\n\nSmerdyakov paused as though pondering.\n\n“There’ll be nothing of the sort, and you won’t go,” he concluded at\nlast positively.\n\n“You don’t understand me,” Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.\n\n“You’ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what’s more,\nit will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never\nsaid anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it\nlooks like it, too), or that you’re so sorry for your brother that you\nare sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against\nme, for you’ve always thought no more of me than if I’d been a fly. And\nwho will believe you, and what single proof have you got?”\n\n“Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.”\n\nSmerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.\n\n“Take that money away with you,” Smerdyakov sighed.\n\n“Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you\ncommitted the murder for the sake of it?” Ivan looked at him with great\nsurprise.",
            "12": "“I don’t want it,” Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a\ngesture of refusal. “I did have an idea of beginning a new life with\nthat money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it,\nchiefly because ‘all things are lawful.’ That was quite right what you\ntaught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if there’s no\neverlasting God, there’s no such thing as virtue, and there’s no need\nof it. You were right there. So that’s how I looked at it.”\n\n“Did you come to that of yourself?” asked Ivan, with a wry smile.\n\n“With your guidance.”\n\n“And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back the\nmoney?”\n\n“No, I don’t believe,” whispered Smerdyakov.\n\n“Then why are you giving it back?”\n\n“Leave off ... that’s enough!” Smerdyakov waved his hand again. “You\nused to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so\nupset, too? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself....\nOnly there’ll be nothing of the sort! You won’t go to give evidence,”\nSmerdyakov decided with conviction.\n\n“You’ll see,” said Ivan.\n\n“It isn’t possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I know\nthat. You like to be respected, too, for you’re very proud; you are far\ntoo fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living\nin undisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any one—that’s what\nyou care most about. You won’t want to spoil your life for ever by\ntaking such a disgrace on yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you\nare more like him than any of his children; you’ve the same soul as he\nhad.”\n\n“You are not a fool,” said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to\nhis face. “You are serious now!” he observed, looking suddenly at\nSmerdyakov with a different expression.\n\n“It was your pride made you think I was a fool. Take the money.”\n\nIvan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without\nwrapping them in anything.\n\n“I shall show them at the court to‐morrow,” he said.\n\n“Nobody will believe you, as you’ve plenty of money of your own; you\nmay simply have taken it out of your cash‐box and brought it to the\ncourt.”\n\nIvan rose from his seat.\n\n“I repeat,” he said, “the only reason I haven’t killed you is that I\nneed you for to‐morrow, remember that, don’t forget it!”\n\n“Well, kill me. Kill me now,” Smerdyakov said, all at once looking\nstrangely at Ivan. “You won’t dare do that even!” he added, with a\nbitter smile. “You won’t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so\nbold!”",
            "13": "“Till to‐morrow,” cried Ivan, and moved to go out.\n\n“Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again.”\n\nIvan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at\nthem for ten seconds.\n\n“Well, you can go,” he said, with a wave of his hand. “Ivan\nFyodorovitch!” he called after him again.\n\n“What do you want?” Ivan turned without stopping.\n\n“Good‐by!”\n\n“Till to‐morrow!” Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage.\n\nThe snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly,\nbut suddenly began staggering. “It’s something physical,” he thought\nwith a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was\nconscious of unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering\nthat had so tortured him of late. His determination was taken, “and now\nit will not be changed,” he thought with relief. At that moment he\nstumbled against something and almost fell down. Stopping short, he\nmade out at his feet the peasant he had knocked down, still lying\nsenseless and motionless. The snow had almost covered his face. Ivan\nseized him and lifted him in his arms. Seeing a light in the little\nhouse to the right he went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the\nman to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the\npolice‐station, promising him three roubles. The man got ready and came\nout. I won’t describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his object,\nbringing the peasant to the police‐station and arranging for a doctor\nto see him at once, providing with a liberal hand for the expenses. I\nwill only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan was well\ncontent with it. His mind wandered and worked incessantly.\n\n“If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to‐morrow,” he reflected\nwith satisfaction, “I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after\nthe peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his being\nfrozen. I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,” he thought\nat the same instant, with still greater satisfaction, “although they\nhave decided that I am going out of my mind!”\n\nJust as he reached his own house he stopped short, asking himself\nsuddenly hadn’t he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him\neverything. He decided the question by turning back to the house.\n“Everything together to‐morrow!” he whispered to himself, and, strange\nto say, almost all his gladness and self‐satisfaction passed in one\ninstant.",
            "14": "As he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his\nheart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of something\nagonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and\nhad been there before. He sank wearily on his sofa. The old woman\nbrought him a samovar; he made tea, but did not touch it. He sat on the\nsofa and felt giddy. He felt that he was ill and helpless. He was\nbeginning to drop asleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the\nroom to shake off his drowsiness. At moments he fancied he was\ndelirious, but it was not illness that he thought of most. Sitting down\nagain, he began looking round, as though searching for something. This\nhappened several times. At last his eyes were fastened intently on one\npoint. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush suffused his face. He sat a long\ntime in his place, his head propped on both arms, though he looked\nsideways at the same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite\nwall. There was evidently something, some object, that irritated him\nthere, worried him and tormented him."

            "0": "I am not a doctor, but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must\ninevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan’s\nillness. Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he was at\nthat moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever. Though his\nhealth had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to\nthe fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it. Though I\nknow nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard the suggestion that he\nreally had perhaps, by a terrible effort of will, succeeded in delaying\nthe attack for a time, hoping, of course, to check it completely. He\nknew that he was unwell, but he loathed the thought of being ill at\nthat fatal time, at the approaching crisis in his life, when he needed\nto have all his wits about him, to say what he had to say boldly and\nresolutely and “to justify himself to himself.”\n\nHe had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from\nMoscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna’s to which I have\nreferred already. After listening to him and examining him the doctor\ncame to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some\ndisorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised by an admission\nwhich Ivan had reluctantly made him. “Hallucinations are quite likely\nin your condition,” the doctor opined, “though it would be better to\nverify them ... you must take steps at once, without a moment’s delay,\nor things will go badly with you.” But Ivan did not follow this\njudicious advice and did not take to his bed to be nursed. “I am\nwalking about, so I am strong enough, if I drop, it’ll be different\nthen, any one may nurse me who likes,” he decided, dismissing the\nsubject.",
            "1": "And so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and, as\nI have said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa\nagainst the opposite wall. Some one appeared to be sitting there,\nthough goodness knows how he had come in, for he had not been in the\nroom when Ivan came into it, on his return from Smerdyakov. This was a\nperson or, more accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a\nparticular kind, no longer young, _qui faisait la cinquantaine_, as the\nFrench say, with rather long, still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked\nwith gray and a small pointed beard. He was wearing a brownish reefer\njacket, rather shabby, evidently made by a good tailor though, and of a\nfashion at least three years old, that had been discarded by smart and\nwell‐to‐do people for the last two years. His linen and his long\nscarf‐like neck‐tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at\nbeing stylish, but on closer inspection his linen was not over‐clean\nand his wide scarf was very threadbare. The visitor’s check trousers\nwere of excellent cut, but were too light in color and too tight for\nthe present fashion. His soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with\nthe season.",
            "2": "In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means.\nIt looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle\nlandowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom. He had\nunmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable society, had\nonce had good connections, had possibly preserved them indeed, but,\nafter a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of\nserfdom, he had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best\nclass, wandering from one good old friend to another and received by\nthem for his companionable and accommodating disposition and as being,\nafter all, a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with any one,\nthough, of course, not in a place of honor. Such gentlemen of\naccommodating temper and dependent position, who can tell a story, take\na hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion for any duties that\nmay be forced upon them, are usually solitary creatures, either\nbachelors or widowers. Sometimes they have children, but if so, the\nchildren are always being brought up at a distance, at some aunt’s, to\nwhom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of\nthe relationship. They gradually lose sight of their children\naltogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas\nletter from them and sometimes even answer it.\n\nThe countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good‐natured,\nas accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion\nmight arise. He had no watch, but he had a tortoise‐shell lorgnette on\na black ribbon. On the middle finger of his right hand was a massive\ngold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.\n\nIvan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. The\nvisitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down\nfrom his room to keep his host company at tea, and was discreetly\nsilent, seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied. But he was\nready for any affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it.\nAll at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude.\n\n“I say,” he began to Ivan, “excuse me, I only mention it to remind you.\nYou went to Smerdyakov’s to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you\ncame away without finding out anything about her, you probably forgot—”",
            "3": "“Ah, yes,” broke from Ivan and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness.\n“Yes, I’d forgotten ... but it doesn’t matter now, never mind, till\nto‐morrow,” he muttered to himself, “and you,” he added, addressing his\nvisitor, “I should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that\nwas just what was tormenting me! Why do you interfere, as if I should\nbelieve that you prompted me, and that I didn’t remember it of myself?”\n\n“Don’t believe it then,” said the gentleman, smiling amicably, “what’s\nthe good of believing against your will? Besides, proofs are no help to\nbelieving, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he\nsaw Christ risen, but because he wanted to believe, before he saw. Look\nat the spiritualists, for instance.... I am very fond of them ... only\nfancy, they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion,\nbecause the devils show them their horns from the other world. That,\nthey say, is a material proof, so to speak, of the existence of another\nworld. The other world and material proofs, what next! And if you come\nto that, does proving there’s a devil prove that there’s a God? I want\nto join an idealist society, I’ll lead the opposition in it, I’ll say I\nam a realist, but not a materialist, he he!”\n\n“Listen,” Ivan suddenly got up from the table. “I seem to be\ndelirious.... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I\ndon’t care! You won’t drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I\nfeel somehow ashamed.... I want to walk about the room.... I sometimes\ndon’t see you and don’t even hear your voice as I did last time, but I\nalways guess what you are prating, for it’s I, _I myself speaking, not\nyou_. Only I don’t know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I\nreally saw you. I’ll wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps\nyou’ll vanish into air.”\n\nIvan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he said, and with a\nwet towel on his head began walking up and down the room.\n\n“I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,” the visitor began.\n\n“Fool,” laughed Ivan, “do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with\nyou? I am in good spirits now, though I’ve a pain in my forehead ...\nand in the top of my head ... only please don’t talk philosophy, as you\ndid last time. If you can’t take yourself off, talk of something\namusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk\ngossip. What a nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I’ll get\nthe better of you. I won’t be taken to a mad‐house!”",
            "4": "“_C’est charmant_, poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For\nwhat am I on earth but a poor relation? By the way, I am listening to\nyou and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take\nme for something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in\ndeclaring last time—”\n\n“Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,” Ivan cried with a\nsort of fury. “You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom.\nIt’s only that I don’t know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer\nfor a time. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of\nmyself, but only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but\nonly the nastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you\nmight be of interest to me, if only I had time to waste on you—”\n\n“Excuse me, excuse me, I’ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha\nunder the lamp‐post this evening and shouted to him, ‘You learnt it\nfrom _him_! How do you know that _he_ visits me?’ you were thinking of\nme then. So for one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,”\nthe gentleman laughed blandly.\n\n“Yes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn’t believe in you.\nI don’t know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was\nonly dreaming then and didn’t see you really at all—”\n\n“And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I’ve\ntreated him badly over Father Zossima.”\n\n“Don’t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!” Ivan laughed again.\n\n“You scold me, but you laugh—that’s a good sign. But you are ever so\nmuch more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great\nresolution of yours—”\n\n“Don’t speak of my resolution,” cried Ivan, savagely.\n\n“I understand, I understand, _c’est noble, c’est charmant_, you are\ngoing to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _C’est\nchevaleresque_.”\n\n“Hold your tongue, I’ll kick you!”\n\n“I shan’t be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained. If\nyou kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don’t kick\nghosts. Joking apart, it doesn’t matter to me, scold if you like,\nthough it’s better to be a trifle more polite even to me. ‘Fool,\nflunkey!’ what words!”\n\n“Scolding you, I scold myself,” Ivan laughed again, “you are myself,\nmyself, only with a different face. You just say what I am thinking ...\nand are incapable of saying anything new!”\n\n“If I am like you in my way of thinking, it’s all to my credit,” the\ngentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.",
            "5": "“You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what’s more, the stupid\nones. You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I can’t\nput up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?” Ivan said through\nhis clenched teeth.\n\n“My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and\nto be recognized as such,” the visitor began in an excess of\ndeprecating and simple‐hearted pride, typical of a poor relation. “I am\npoor, but ... I won’t say very honest, but ... it’s an axiom generally\naccepted in society that I am a fallen angel. I certainly can’t\nconceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I ever was, it must have\nbeen so long ago that there’s no harm in forgetting it. Now I only\nprize the reputation of being a gentlemanly person and live as I can,\ntrying to make myself agreeable. I love men genuinely, I’ve been\ngreatly calumniated! Here when I stay with you from time to time, my\nlife gains a kind of reality and that’s what I like most of all. You\nsee, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I love the realism of\nearth. Here, with you, everything is circumscribed, here all is\nformulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but indeterminate\nequations! I wander about here dreaming. I like dreaming. Besides, on\nearth I become superstitious. Please don’t laugh, that’s just what I\nlike, to become superstitious. I adopt all your habits here: I’ve grown\nfond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go and\nsteam myself with merchants and priests. What I dream of is becoming\nincarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant’s\nwife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she believes. My\nideal is to go to church and offer a candle in simple‐hearted faith,\nupon my word it is. Then there would be an end to my sufferings. I like\nbeing doctored too; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and\nI went and was vaccinated in a foundling hospital—if only you knew how\nI enjoyed myself that day. I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the\nSlavs!... But you are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all\nwell this evening? I know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well,\nwhat about your health? What did the doctor say?”\n\n“Fool!” Ivan snapped out.\n\n“But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn’t ask out\nof sympathy. You needn’t answer. Now rheumatism has come in again—”\n\n“Fool!” repeated Ivan.",
            "6": "“You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism\nlast year that I remember it to this day.”\n\n“The devil have rheumatism!”\n\n“Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form and\nI take the consequences. Satan _sum et nihil humanum a me alienum\nputo_.”\n\n“What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... that’s not bad for the\ndevil!”\n\n“I am glad I’ve pleased you at last.”\n\n“But you didn’t get that from me.” Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming\nstruck. “That never entered my head, that’s strange.”\n\n“_C’est du nouveau, n’est‐ce pas?_ This time I’ll act honestly and\nexplain to you. Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from\nindigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions,\nsuch complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world of\nevents, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from the\nmost exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo\nTolstoy has never invented. Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by\nwriters, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists,\npriests.... The subject is a complete enigma. A statesman confessed to\nme, indeed, that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep.\nWell, that’s how it is now, though I am your hallucination, yet just as\nin a nightmare, I say original things which had not entered your head\nbefore. So I don’t repeat your ideas, yet I am only your nightmare,\nnothing more.”\n\n“You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not\nmy nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.”\n\n“My dear fellow, I’ve adopted a special method to‐day, I’ll explain it\nto you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off? Oh, yes! I caught cold\nthen, only not here but yonder.”\n\n“Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long? Can’t you go away?”\nIvan exclaimed almost in despair. He ceased walking to and fro, sat\ndown on the sofa, leaned his elbows on the table again and held his\nhead tight in both hands. He pulled the wet towel off and flung it away\nin vexation. It was evidently of no use.",
            "7": "“Your nerves are out of order,” observed the gentleman, with a\ncarelessly easy, though perfectly polite, air. “You are angry with me\neven for being able to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural\nway. I was hurrying then to a diplomatic _soirée_ at the house of a\nlady of high rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the\nMinistry. Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God\nknows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth.... Of\ncourse, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light from the\nsun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open\nwaistcoat. Spirits don’t freeze, but when one’s in fleshly form, well\n... in brief, I didn’t think, and set off, and you know in those\nethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament, there’s such\na frost ... at least one can’t call it frost, you can fancy, 150\ndegrees below zero! You know the game the village girls play—they\ninvite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees of frost, the tongue\ninstantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off, so it bleeds.\nBut that’s only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagine it would be\nenough to put your finger on the ax and it would be the end of it ...\nif only there could be an ax there.”\n\n“And can there be an ax there?” Ivan interrupted, carelessly and\ndisdainfully. He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in\nthe delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.\n\n“An ax?” the guest interrupted in surprise.\n\n“Yes, what would become of an ax there?” Ivan cried suddenly, with a\nsort of savage and insistent obstinacy.\n\n“What would become of an ax in space? _Quelle idée!_ If it were to fall\nto any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth\nwithout knowing why, like a satellite. The astronomers would calculate\nthe rising and the setting of the ax, _Gatzuk_ would put it in his\ncalendar, that’s all.”\n\n“You are stupid, awfully stupid,” said Ivan peevishly. “Fib more\ncleverly or I won’t listen. You want to get the better of me by\nrealism, to convince me that you exist, but I don’t want to believe you\nexist! I won’t believe it!”\n\n“But I am not fibbing, it’s all the truth; the truth is unhappily\nhardly ever amusing. I see you persist in expecting something big of\nme, and perhaps something fine. That’s a great pity, for I only give\nwhat I can—”\n\n“Don’t talk philosophy, you ass!”",
            "8": "“Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning\nand groaning. I’ve tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnose\nbeautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger‐tips,\nbut they’ve no idea how to cure you. There was an enthusiastic little\nstudent here, ‘You may die,’ said he, ‘but you’ll know perfectly what\ndisease you are dying of!’ And then what a way they have sending people\nto specialists! ‘We only diagnose,’ they say, ‘but go to such‐and‐such\na specialist, he’ll cure you.’ The old doctor who used to cure all\nsorts of disease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there\nare only specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers. If\nanything is wrong with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they\nsay, is a European specialist who cures noses. If you go to Paris,\nhe’ll look at your nose; I can only cure your right nostril, he’ll tell\nyou, for I don’t cure the left nostril, that’s not my speciality, but\ngo to Vienna, there there’s a specialist who will cure your left\nnostril. What are you to do? I fell back on popular remedies, a German\ndoctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the bath‐house.\nSolely to get an extra bath I went, smeared myself all over and it did\nme no good at all. In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan. He sent\nme a book and some drops, bless him, and, only fancy, Hoff’s malt\nextract cured me! I bought it by accident, drank a bottle and a half of\nit, and I was ready to dance, it took it away completely. I made up my\nmind to write to the papers to thank him, I was prompted by a feeling\nof gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a bother: not a\nsingle paper would take my letter. ‘It would be very reactionary,’ they\nsaid, ‘no one will believe it. _Le diable n’existe point._ You’d better\nremain anonymous,’ they advised me. What use is a letter of thanks if\nit’s anonymous? I laughed with the men at the newspaper office; ‘It’s\nreactionary to believe in God in our days,’ I said, ‘but I am the\ndevil, so I may be believed in.’ ‘We quite understand that,’ they said.\n‘Who doesn’t believe in the devil? Yet it won’t do, it might injure our\nreputation. As a joke, if you like.’ But I thought as a joke it\nwouldn’t be very witty. So it wasn’t printed. And do you know, I have\nfelt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, for\ninstance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.”\n\n“Philosophical reflections again?” Ivan snarled malignantly.",
            "9": "“God preserve me from it, but one can’t help complaining sometimes. I\nam a slandered man. You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One\ncan see you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn’t the only\nthing! I have naturally a kind and merry heart. ‘I also write\nvaudevilles of all sorts.’ You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old,\nbut my fate is a far more serious one. Before time was, by some decree\nwhich I could never make out, I was pre‐destined ‘to deny’ and yet I am\ngenuinely good‐hearted and not at all inclined to negation. ‘No, you\nmust go and deny, without denial there’s no criticism and what would a\njournal be without a column of criticism?’ Without criticism it would\nbe nothing but one ‘hosannah.’ But nothing but hosannah is not enough\nfor life, the hosannah must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so\non, in the same style. But I don’t meddle in that, I didn’t create it,\nI am not answerable for it. Well, they’ve chosen their scapegoat,\nthey’ve made me write the column of criticism and so life was made\npossible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask for\nannihilation. No, live, I am told, for there’d be nothing without you.\nIf everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen.\nThere would be no events without you, and there must be events. So\nagainst the grain I serve to produce events and do what’s irrational\nbecause I am commanded to. For all their indisputable intelligence, men\ntake this farce as something serious, and that is their tragedy. They\nsuffer, of course ... but then they live, they live a real life, not a\nfantastic one, for suffering is life. Without suffering what would be\nthe pleasure of it? It would be transformed into an endless church\nservice; it would be holy, but tedious. But what about me? I suffer,\nbut still, I don’t live. I am x in an indeterminate equation. I am a\nsort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning and end, and who has\neven forgotten his own name. You are laughing— no, you are not\nlaughing, you are angry again. You are for ever angry, all you care\nabout is intelligence, but I repeat again that I would give away all\nthis super‐stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply to be\ntransformed into the soul of a merchant’s wife weighing eighteen stone\nand set candles at God’s shrine.”\n\n“Then even you don’t believe in God?” said Ivan, with a smile of\nhatred.\n\n“What can I say?—that is, if you are in earnest—”\n\n“Is there a God or not?” Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.",
            "10": "“Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don’t\nknow. There! I’ve said it now!”\n\n“You don’t know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you\nare myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my\nfancy!”\n\n“Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be\ntrue. _Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest,\nall these worlds, God and even Satan—all that is not proved, to my\nmind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of\nmyself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed for\never: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to\nbeat me directly.”\n\n“You’d better tell me some anecdote!” said Ivan miserably.",
            "11": "“There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not\nan anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you\ndon’t believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We\nare all in a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once\nthere used to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything\nhung together somehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but\nsince we’ve learned that you’ve discovered the chemical molecule and\nprotoplasm and the devil knows what, we had to lower our crest. There’s\na regular muddle, and, above all, superstition, scandal; there’s as\nmuch scandal among us as among you, you know; a little more in fact,\nand spying, indeed, for we have our secret police department where\nprivate information is received. Well, this wild legend belongs to our\nmiddle ages—not yours, but ours—and no one believes it even among us,\nexcept the old ladies of eighteen stone, not your old ladies I mean,\nbut ours. We’ve everything you have, I am revealing one of our secrets\nout of friendship for you; though it’s forbidden. This legend is about\nParadise. There was, they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher.\nHe rejected everything, ‘laws, conscience, faith,’ and, above all, the\nfuture life. He died; he expected to go straight to darkness and death\nand he found a future life before him. He was astounded and indignant.\n‘This is against my principles!’ he said. And he was punished for that\n... that is, you must excuse me, I am just repeating what I heard\nmyself, it’s only a legend ... he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion\nkilometers in the dark (we’ve adopted the metric system, you know) and\nwhen he has finished that quadrillion, the gates of heaven would be\nopened to him and he’ll be forgiven—”\n\n“And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion\nkilometers?” asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.",
            "12": "“What tortures? Ah, don’t ask. In old days we had all sorts, but now\nthey have taken chiefly to moral punishments—‘the stings of conscience’\nand all that nonsense. We got that, too, from you, from the softening\nof your manners. And who’s the better for it? Only those who have got\nno conscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they\nhave none? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor\nsuffer for it. Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them,\nespecially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but\nmischief! The ancient fire was better. Well, this man, who was\ncondemned to the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and\nlay down across the road. ‘I won’t go, I refuse on principle!’ Take the\nsoul of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the\nprophet Jonah, who sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the\nwhale, and you get the character of that thinker who lay across the\nroad.”\n\n“What did he lie on there?”\n\n“Well, I suppose there was something to lie on. You are not laughing?”\n\n“Bravo!” cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he was\nlistening with an unexpected curiosity. “Well, is he lying there now?”\n\n“That’s the point, that he isn’t. He lay there almost a thousand years\nand then he got up and went on.”\n\n“What an ass!” cried Ivan, laughing nervously and still seeming to be\npondering something intently. “Does it make any difference whether he\nlies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take\na billion years to walk it?”\n\n“Much more than that. I haven’t got a pencil and paper or I could work\nit out. But he got there long ago, and that’s where the story begins.”\n\n“What, he got there? But how did he get the billion years to do it?”\n\n“Why, you keep thinking of our present earth! But our present earth may\nhave been repeated a billion times. Why, it’s become extinct, been\nfrozen; cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again\n‘the water above the firmament,’ then again a comet, again a sun, again\nfrom the sun it becomes earth—and the same sequence may have been\nrepeated endlessly and exactly the same to every detail, most unseemly\nand insufferably tedious—”\n\n“Well, well, what happened when he arrived?”",
            "13": "“Why, the moment the gates of Paradise were open and he walked in,\nbefore he had been there two seconds, by his watch (though to my\nthinking his watch must have long dissolved into its elements on the\nway), he cried out that those two seconds were worth walking not a\nquadrillion kilometers but a quadrillion of quadrillions, raised to the\nquadrillionth power! In fact, he sang ‘hosannah’ and overdid it so,\nthat some persons there of lofty ideas wouldn’t shake hands with him at\nfirst—he’d become too rapidly reactionary, they said. The Russian\ntemperament. I repeat, it’s a legend. I give it for what it’s worth. So\nthat’s the sort of ideas we have on such subjects even now.”\n\n“I’ve caught you!” Ivan cried, with an almost childish delight, as\nthough he had succeeded in remembering something at last. “That\nanecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen\nthen, I was at the high school. I made up that anecdote and told it to\na schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so\ncharacteristic that I couldn’t have taken it from anywhere. I thought\nI’d forgotten it ... but I’ve unconsciously recalled it—I recalled it\nmyself—it was not you telling it! Thousands of things are unconsciously\nremembered like that even when people are being taken to execution ...\nit’s come back to me in a dream. You are that dream! You are a dream,\nnot a living creature!”\n\n“From the vehemence with which you deny my existence,” laughed the\ngentleman, “I am convinced that you believe in me.”\n\n“Not in the slightest! I haven’t a hundredth part of a grain of faith\nin you!”\n\n“But you have the thousandth of a grain. Homeopathic doses perhaps are\nthe strongest. Confess that you have faith even to the ten‐thousandth\nof a grain.”\n\n“Not for one minute,” cried Ivan furiously. “But I should like to\nbelieve in you,” he added strangely.\n\n“Aha! There’s an admission! But I am good‐natured. I’ll come to your\nassistance again. Listen, it was I caught you, not you me. I told you\nyour anecdote you’d forgotten, on purpose, so as to destroy your faith\nin me completely.”\n\n“You are lying. The object of your visit is to convince me of your\nexistence!”",
            "14": "“Just so. But hesitation, suspense, conflict between belief and\ndisbelief—is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man, such as you\nare, that it’s better to hang oneself at once. Knowing that you are\ninclined to believe in me, I administered some disbelief by telling you\nthat anecdote. I lead you to belief and disbelief by turns, and I have\nmy motive in it. It’s the new method. As soon as you disbelieve in me\ncompletely, you’ll begin assuring me to my face that I am not a dream\nbut a reality. I know you. Then I shall have attained my object, which\nis an honorable one. I shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and\nit will grow into an oak‐tree—and such an oak‐tree that, sitting on it,\nyou will long to enter the ranks of ‘the hermits in the wilderness and\nthe saintly women,’ for that is what you are secretly longing for.\nYou’ll dine on locusts, you’ll wander into the wilderness to save your\nsoul!”\n\n“Then it’s for the salvation of my soul you are working, is it, you\nscoundrel?”\n\n“One must do a good work sometimes. How ill‐humored you are!”\n\n“Fool! did you ever tempt those holy men who ate locusts and prayed\nseventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss?”\n\n“My dear fellow, I’ve done nothing else. One forgets the whole world\nand all the worlds, and sticks to one such saint, because he is a very\nprecious diamond. One such soul, you know, is sometimes worth a whole\nconstellation. We have our system of reckoning, you know. The conquest\nis priceless! And some of them, on my word, are not inferior to you in\nculture, though you won’t believe it. They can contemplate such depths\nof belief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really\nseems that they are within a hair’s‐breadth of being ‘turned upside\ndown,’ as the actor Gorbunov says.”\n\n“Well, did you get your nose pulled?”[8]",
            "15": "“My dear fellow,” observed the visitor sententiously, “it’s better to\nget off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all. As an\nafflicted marquis observed not long ago (he must have been treated by a\nspecialist) in confession to his spiritual father—a Jesuit. I was\npresent, it was simply charming. ‘Give me back my nose!’ he said, and\nhe beat his breast. ‘My son,’ said the priest evasively, ‘all things\nare accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of\nProvidence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to\nextraordinary, though unapparent, benefits. If stern destiny has\ndeprived you of your nose, it’s to your advantage that no one can ever\npull you by your nose.’ ‘Holy father, that’s no comfort,’ cried the\ndespairing marquis. ‘I’d be delighted to have my nose pulled every day\nof my life, if it were only in its proper place.’ ‘My son,’ sighs the\npriest, ‘you can’t expect every blessing at once. This is murmuring\nagainst Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, for if you\nrepine as you repined just now, declaring you’d be glad to have your\nnose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already been\nfulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by the\nnose.’ ”\n\n“Fool, how stupid!” cried Ivan.",
            "16": "“My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that’s the\ngenuine Jesuit casuistry and I swear that it all happened word for word\nas I’ve told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of\ntrouble. The unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got\nhome. I was by his side till the very last moment. Those Jesuit\nconfessionals are really my most delightful diversion at melancholy\nmoments. Here’s another incident that happened only the other day. A\nlittle blonde Norman girl of twenty—a buxom, unsophisticated beauty\nthat would make your mouth water—comes to an old priest. She bends down\nand whispers her sin into the grating. ‘Why, my daughter, have you\nfallen again already?’ cries the priest. ‘O Sancta Maria, what do I\nhear! Not the same man this time, how long is this going on? Aren’t you\nashamed!’ ‘_Ah, mon père_,’ answers the sinner with tears of penitence,\n‘_ça lui fait tant de plaisir, et à moi si peu de peine!_’ Fancy, such\nan answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature, better than innocence\nitself, if you like. I absolved her sin on the spot and was turning to\ngo, but I was forced to turn back. I heard the priest at the grating\nmaking an appointment with her for the evening—though he was an old man\nhard as flint, he fell in an instant! It was nature, the truth of\nnature asserted its rights! What, you are turning up your nose again?\nAngry again? I don’t know how to please you—”\n\n“Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting\nnightmare,” Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his apparition. “I\nam bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably. I would give anything\nto be able to shake you off!”",
            "17": "“I repeat, moderate your expectations, don’t demand of me ‘everything\ngreat and noble’ and you’ll see how well we shall get on,” said the\ngentleman impressively. “You are really angry with me for not having\nappeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with\nscorched wings, but have shown myself in such a modest form. You are\nwounded, in the first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly,\nin your pride. How could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as\nyou! Yes, there is that romantic strain in you, that was so derided by\nByelinsky. I can’t help it, young man, as I got ready to come to you I\ndid think as a joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who\nhad served in the Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my\ncoat. But I was positively afraid of doing it, for you’d have thrashed\nme for daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at\nleast, the Polar Star or the Sirius. And you keep on saying I am\nstupid, but, mercy on us! I make no claim to be equal to you in\nintelligence. Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil,\nbut did only good. Well, he can say what he likes, it’s quite the\nopposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves\nthe truth and genuinely desires good. I was there when the Word, Who\ndied on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul of\nthe penitent thief. I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing\nand shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which\nshook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that’s sacred,\nI longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all. The word\nhad almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you know how\nsusceptible and esthetically impressionable I am. But common sense—oh,\na most unhappy trait in my character—kept me in due bounds and I let\nthe moment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would\nhave happened after my hosannah? Everything on earth would have been\nextinguished at once and no events could have occurred. And so, solely\nfrom a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress\nthe good moment and to stick to my nasty task. Somebody takes all the\ncredit of what’s good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left\nfor me. But I don’t envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am\nnot ambitious. Why am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be\ncursed by all decent people and even to be kicked, for if I put on\nmortal form I am bound to take such consequences sometimes? I know, of\ncourse, there’s a secret in it, but they won’t tell me the secret for\nanything, for then perhaps, seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl\nhosannah, and the indispensable minus would disappear at once, and good\nsense would reign supreme throughout the whole world. And that, of\ncourse, would mean the end of everything, even of magazines and\nnewspapers, for who would take them in? I know that at the end of all\nthings I shall be reconciled. I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and\nlearn the secret. But till that happens I am sulking and fulfill my\ndestiny though it’s against the grain—that is, to ruin thousands for\nthe sake of saving one. How many souls have had to be ruined and how\nmany honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous\nman, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days! Yes, till\nthe secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me—one, their\ntruth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other my own.\nAnd there’s no knowing which will turn out the better.... Are you\nasleep?”",
            "18": "“I might well be,” Ivan groaned angrily. “All my stupid ideas—outgrown,\nthrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass—you present\nto me as something new!”\n\n“There’s no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by my\nliterary style. That hosannah in the skies really wasn’t bad, was it?\nAnd then that ironical tone _à la_ Heine, eh?”\n\n“No, I was never such a flunkey! How then could my soul beget a flunkey\nlike you?”\n\n“My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russian\ngentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, the\nauthor of a promising poem entitled _The Grand Inquisitor_. I was only\nthinking of him!”\n\n“I forbid you to speak of _The Grand Inquisitor_,” cried Ivan, crimson\nwith shame.\n\n“And the _Geological Cataclysm_. Do you remember? That was a poem,\nnow!”\n\n“Hold your tongue, or I’ll kill you!”",
            "19": "“You’ll kill me? No, excuse me, I will speak. I came to treat myself to\nthat pleasure. Oh, I love the dreams of my ardent young friends,\nquivering with eagerness for life! ‘There are new men,’ you decided\nlast spring, when you were meaning to come here, ‘they propose to\ndestroy everything and begin with cannibalism. Stupid fellows! they\ndidn’t ask my advice! I maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that\nwe only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that’s how we have to\nset to work. It’s that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind race of men\nwho have no understanding! As soon as men have all of them denied\nGod—and I believe that period, analogous with geological periods, will\ncome to pass—the old conception of the universe will fall of itself\nwithout cannibalism, and, what’s more, the old morality, and everything\nwill begin anew. Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but\nonly for joy and happiness in the present world. Man will be lifted up\nwith a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man‐ god will appear.\nFrom hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his\nwill and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in\ndoing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of\nheaven. Every one will know that he is mortal and will accept death\nproudly and serenely like a god. His pride will teach him that it’s\nuseless for him to repine at life’s being a moment, and he will love\nhis brother without need of reward. Love will be sufficient only for a\nmoment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will\nintensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love\nbeyond the grave’... and so on and so on in the same style. Charming!”\n\nIvan sat with his eyes on the floor, and his hands pressed to his ears,\nbut he began trembling all over. The voice continued.",
            "20": "“The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that\nsuch a period will ever come? If it does, everything is determined and\nhumanity is settled for ever. But as, owing to man’s inveterate\nstupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years, every\none who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately order his life\nas he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, ‘all things are\nlawful’ for him. What’s more, even if this period never comes to pass,\nsince there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well\nbecome the man‐god, even if he is the only one in the whole world, and\npromoted to his new position, he may lightheartedly overstep all the\nbarriers of the old morality of the old slave‐man, if necessary. There\nis no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where I stand\nwill be at once the foremost place ... ‘all things are lawful’ and\nthat’s the end of it! That’s all very charming; but if you want to\nswindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it? But that’s our\nmodern Russian all over. He can’t bring himself to swindle without a\nmoral sanction. He is so in love with truth—”\n\nThe visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence,\nspeaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he\ndid not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the\ntable and flung it at the orator.\n\n“_Ah, mais c’est bête enfin_,” cried the latter, jumping up from the\nsofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. “He remembers Luther’s\ninkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It’s\nlike a woman! I suspected you were only pretending to stop up your\nears.”\n\nA loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan\njumped up from the sofa.\n\n“Do you hear? You’d better open,” cried the visitor; “it’s your brother\nAlyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I’ll be bound!”\n\n“Be silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and\nof course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings ‘news,’ ”\nIvan exclaimed frantically.\n\n“Open, open to him. There’s a snowstorm and he is your brother.\n_Monsieur sait‐il le temps qu’il fait? C’est à ne pas mettre un chien\ndehors_.”",
            "21": "The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but\nsomething seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort\nto break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew\nlouder and louder. At last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up\nfrom the sofa. He looked round him wildly. Both candles had almost\nburnt out, the glass he had just thrown at his visitor stood before him\non the table, and there was no one on the sofa opposite. The knocking\non the window frame went on persistently, but it was by no means so\nloud as it had seemed in his dream; on the contrary, it was quite\nsubdued.\n\n“It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened\njust now!” cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable\npane.\n\n“Alyosha, I told you not to come,” he cried fiercely to his brother.\n“In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?”\n\n“An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,” Alyosha answered from the\nyard.\n\n“Come round to the steps, I’ll open at once,” said Ivan, going to open\nthe door to Alyosha."

            "0": "Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya\nKondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken\nhis own life. “I went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging\non a nail in the wall.” On Alyosha’s inquiring whether she had informed\nthe police, she answered that she had told no one, “but I flew straight\nto you, I’ve run all the way.” She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha\nreported, and was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the\ncottage, he found Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: “I\ndestroy my life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on\nany one.” Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the\npolice captain and told him all about it. “And from him I’ve come\nstraight to you,” said Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into\nIvan’s face. He had not taken his eyes off him while he told his story,\nas though struck by something in his expression.\n\n“Brother,” he cried suddenly, “you must be terribly ill. You look and\ndon’t seem to understand what I tell you.”\n\n“It’s a good thing you came,” said Ivan, as though brooding, and not\nhearing Alyosha’s exclamation. “I knew he had hanged himself.”\n\n“From whom?”\n\n“I don’t know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he told me. He told me so\njust now.”\n\nIvan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same\nbrooding tone, looking at the ground.\n\n“Who is _he_?” asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round.\n\n“He’s slipped away.”\n\nIvan raised his head and smiled softly.\n\n“He was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a ‘pure cherub.’\nDmitri calls you a cherub. Cherub!... the thunderous rapture of the\nseraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps\nthat constellation is only a chemical molecule. There’s a constellation\nof the Lion and the Sun. Don’t you know it?”\n\n“Brother, sit down,” said Alyosha in alarm. “For goodness’ sake, sit\ndown on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow,\nthat’s right. Would you like a wet towel on your head? Perhaps it will\ndo you good.”\n\n“Give me the towel: it’s here on the chair. I just threw it down\nthere.”\n\n“It’s not here. Don’t worry yourself. I know where it is—here,” said\nAlyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivan’s\ndressing‐ table in the other corner of the room. Ivan looked strangely\nat the towel: recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant.",
            "1": "“Stay”—he got up from the sofa—“an hour ago I took that new towel from\nthere and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here\n... How is it it’s dry? There was no other.”\n\n“You put that towel on your head?” asked Alyosha.\n\n“Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the\ncandles burnt down so? What’s the time?”\n\n“Nearly twelve.”\n\n“No, no, no!” Ivan cried suddenly. “It was not a dream. He was here; he\nwas sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw\na glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but\nthis dream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now,\nAlyosha ... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk\nand see ... though I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa\nthere.... He is frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.” Ivan\nlaughed suddenly and began pacing about the room.\n\n“Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?” Alyosha asked\nanxiously again.\n\n“The devil! He’s taken to visiting me. He’s been here twice, almost\nthree times. He taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil\nand not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning. But he is\nnot Satan: that’s a lie. He is an impostor. He is simply a devil—a\npaltry, trivial devil. He goes to the baths. If you undressed him,\nyou’d be sure to find he had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish\ndog’s, a yard long, dun color.... Alyosha, you are cold. You’ve been in\nthe snow. Would you like some tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her\nto bring some? _C’est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors._...”\n\nAlyosha ran to the washing‐stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to\nsit down again, and put the wet towel round his head. He sat down\nbeside him.\n\n“What were you telling me just now about Lise?” Ivan began again. (He\nwas becoming very talkative.) “I like Lise. I said something nasty\nabout her. It was a lie. I like her ... I am afraid for Katya\nto‐morrow. I am more afraid of her than of anything. On account of the\nfuture. She will cast me off to‐morrow and trample me under foot. She\nthinks that I am ruining Mitya from jealousy on her account! Yes, she\nthinks that! But it’s not so. To‐morrow the cross, but not the gallows.\nNo, I shan’t hang myself. Do you know, I can never commit suicide,\nAlyosha. Is it because I am base? I am not a coward. Is it from love of\nlife? How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself? Yes, it was\n_he_ told me so.”",
            "2": "“And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?” asked\nAlyosha.\n\n“Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him away. You\ndid drive him away: he disappeared when you arrived. I love your face,\nAlyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ is myself,\nAlyosha. All that’s base in me, all that’s mean and contemptible. Yes,\nI am a romantic. He guessed it ... though it’s a libel. He is\nfrightfully stupid; but it’s to his advantage. He has cunning, animal\ncunning—he knew how to infuriate me. He kept taunting me with believing\nin him, and that was how he made me listen to him. He fooled me like a\nboy. He told me a great deal that was true about myself, though. I\nshould never have owned it to myself. Do you know, Alyosha,” Ivan added\nin an intensely earnest and confidential tone, “I should be awfully\nglad to think that it was _he_ and not I.”\n\n“He has worn you out,” said Alyosha, looking compassionately at his\nbrother.\n\n“He’s been teasing me. And you know he does it so cleverly, so\ncleverly. ‘Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why\nam I tormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind\nfor the seven thousand years. So let us give it up, and we shall be\ngods.’ It was he said that, it was he said that!”\n\n“And not you, not you?” Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly\nat his brother. “Never mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget\nhim. And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come\nback!”\n\n“Yes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,”\nIvan said, with a shudder of offense. “But he was unfair to me, unfair\nto me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. ‘Oh, you\nare going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered\nyour father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.’ ”\n\n“Brother,” Alyosha interposed, “restrain yourself. It was not you\nmurdered him. It’s not true!”\n\n“That’s what he says, he, and he knows it. ‘You are going to perform an\nact of heroic virtue, and you don’t believe in virtue; that’s what\ntortures you and makes you angry, that’s why you are so vindictive.’ He\nsaid that to me about me and he knows what he says.”\n\n“It’s you say that, not he,” exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, “and you say\nit because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.”",
            "3": "“No, he knows what he says. ‘You are going from pride,’ he says.\n‘You’ll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe\nwith horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your\nhorror!’ He said that about me. ‘And do you know you are longing for\ntheir praise—“he is a criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul;\nhe wanted to save his brother and he confessed.” ’ That’s a lie,\nAlyosha!” Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes. “I don’t want the\nlow rabble to praise me, I swear I don’t! That’s a lie! That’s why I\nthrew the glass at him and it broke against his ugly face.”\n\n“Brother, calm yourself, stop!” Alyosha entreated him.\n\n“Yes, he knows how to torment one. He’s cruel,” Ivan went on,\nunheeding. “I had an inkling from the first what he came for. ‘Granting\nthat you go through pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might\nbe convicted and sent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while\nyou would only be punished with moral condemnation’ (‘Do you hear?’ he\nlaughed then)—‘and some people will praise you. But now Smerdyakov’s\ndead, he has hanged himself, and who’ll believe you alone? But yet you\nare going, you are going, you’ll go all the same, you’ve decided to go.\nWhat are you going for now?’ That’s awful, Alyosha. I can’t endure such\nquestions. Who dare ask me such questions?”\n\n“Brother,” interposed Alyosha—his heart sank with terror, but he still\nseemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason—“how could he have told you of\nSmerdyakov’s death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was\nno time for any one to know of it?”",
            "4": "“He told me,” said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. “It was all\nhe did talk about, if you come to that. ‘And it would be all right if\nyou believed in virtue,’ he said. ‘No matter if they disbelieve you,\nyou are going for the sake of principle. But you are a little pig like\nFyodor Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to\ngo meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you\ndon’t know yourself why you go! Oh, you’d give a great deal to know\nyourself why you go! And can you have made up your mind? You’ve not\nmade up your mind. You’ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or\nnot. But you will go; you know you’ll go. You know that whichever way\nyou decide, the decision does not depend on you. You’ll go because you\nwon’t dare not to go. Why won’t you dare? You must guess that for\nyourself. That’s a riddle for you!’ He got up and went away. You came\nand he went. He called me a coward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l’énigme_ is\nthat I am a coward. ‘It is not for such eagles to soar above the\nearth.’ It was he added that—he! And Smerdyakov said the same. He must\nbe killed! Katya despises me. I’ve seen that for a month past. Even\nLise will begin to despise me! ‘You are going in order to be praised.’\nThat’s a brutal lie! And you despise me too, Alyosha. Now I am going to\nhate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I hate the monster! I\ndon’t want to save the monster. Let him rot in Siberia! He’s begun\nsinging a hymn! Oh, to‐morrow I’ll go, stand before them, and spit in\ntheir faces!”\n\nHe jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up\nand down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. “I\nseem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.”\nIt seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The\nthought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid\nto leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave\nhim. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still\nwent on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even\narticulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently;\nbut Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his\nbed. Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching\nover him for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without\nstirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay\ndown on the sofa, without undressing.",
            "5": "As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand\nIvan’s illness. “The anguish of a proud determination. An earnest\nconscience!” God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining\nmastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. “Yes,” the\nthought floated through Alyosha’s head as it lay on the pillow, “yes,\nif Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan’s evidence; but he will\ngo and give it.” Alyosha smiled softly. “God will conquer!” he thought.\n“He will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he’ll perish in\nhate, revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause\nhe does not believe in,” Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed\nfor Ivan.\n\n\n\n\nBook XII.

            "0": "At ten o’clock in the morning of the day following the events I have\ndescribed, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.\n\nI hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself\ncapable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail,\nor even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention\neverything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large\none. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to\nwhat struck me. I may have selected as of most interest what was of\nsecondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and\nessential details. But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will\ndo my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I\ncan.\n\nAnd, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what\nsurprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one\nwas surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great\ninterest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to\nbegin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and\nsurmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too,\nthat the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not\nimagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in\nevery one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became\nevident at the trial this day.",
            "1": "Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, but\nfrom several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and\nPetersburg. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several\ndistinguished personages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched\nup. A special place behind the table at which the three judges sat was\nset apart for the most distinguished and important of the men visitors;\na row of arm‐chairs had been placed there—something exceptional, which\nhad never been allowed before. A large proportion—not less than half of\nthe public—were ladies. There was such a large number of lawyers from\nall parts that they did not know where to seat them, for every ticket\nhad long since been eagerly sought for and distributed. I saw at the\nend of the room, behind the platform, a special partition hurriedly put\nup, behind which all these lawyers were admitted, and they thought\nthemselves lucky to have standing room there, for all chairs had been\nremoved for the sake of space, and the crowd behind the partition stood\nthroughout the case closely packed, shoulder to shoulder.",
            "2": "Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made\ntheir appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority\nof the ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces betrayed\nhysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar\nfact—established afterwards by many observations—was that almost all\nthe ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were on Mitya’s\nside and in favor of his being acquitted. This was perhaps chiefly\nowing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts. It was known\nthat two women rivals were to appear in the case. One of them—Katerina\nIvanovna—was an object of general interest. All sorts of extraordinary\ntales were told about her, amazing anecdotes of her passion for Mitya,\nin spite of his crime. Her pride and “aristocratic connections” were\nparticularly insisted upon (she had called upon scarcely any one in the\ntown). People said she intended to petition the Government for leave to\naccompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him somewhere in\nthe mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no\nless impatience. The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity\nto the meeting of the two rivals—the proud aristocratic girl and “the\nhetaira.” But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of the\ndistrict than Katerina Ivanovna. They had already seen “the woman who\nhad ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,” and all, almost\nwithout exception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with\n“such a very common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.”",
            "3": "In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that there\nwere several serious family quarrels on Mitya’s account in our town.\nMany ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of\nopinion about the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the\nhusbands of these ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the\nprisoner, should enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him. In\nfact, one may say pretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished\nfrom the feminine, part of the audience were biased against the\nprisoner. There were numbers of severe, frowning, even vindictive\nfaces. Mitya, indeed, had managed to offend many people during his stay\nin the town. Some of the visitors were, of course, in excellent spirits\nand quite unconcerned as to the fate of Mitya personally. But all were\ninterested in the trial, and the majority of the men were certainly\nhoping for the conviction of the criminal, except perhaps the lawyers,\nwho were more interested in the legal than in the moral aspect of the\ncase.",
            "4": "Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer,\nFetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was not the first\ntime he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces. And if\nhe defended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all\nover Russia. There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about\nthe President of the Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was\nin a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies\nfrom the beginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our\nsensitive prosecutor, who always considered that he had been aggrieved\nby some one in Petersburg because his talents had not been properly\nappreciated, was keenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even\ndreaming of rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it,\nFetyukovitch, they said, was his one anxiety. But these rumors were not\nquite just. Our prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in\nface of danger. On the contrary, his self‐confidence increased with the\nincrease of danger. It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general\ntoo hasty and morbidly impressionable. He would put his whole soul into\nsome case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole fortune\ndepended on its result. This was the subject of some ridicule in the\nlegal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had gained\na wider notoriety than could have been expected from his modest\nposition. People laughed particularly at his passion for psychology. In\nmy opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor was, I believe, a\ncharacter of greater depth than was generally supposed. But with his\ndelicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset of his\ncareer and had never made up for it later.",
            "5": "As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a humane\nand cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his work and\nprogressive views. He was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself\ngreatly about his future career. The great aim of his life was to be a\nman of advanced ideas. He was, too, a man of connections and property.\nHe felt, as we learnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov\ncase, but from a social, not from a personal standpoint. He was\ninterested in it as a social phenomenon, in its classification and its\ncharacter as a product of our social conditions, as typical of the\nnational character, and so on, and so on. His attitude to the personal\naspect of the case, to its tragic significance and the persons involved\nin it, including the prisoner, was rather indifferent and abstract, as\nwas perhaps fitting, indeed.\n\nThe court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their\nappearance. Our court is the best hall in the town—spacious, lofty, and\ngood for sound. On the right of the judges, who were on a raised\nplatform, a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the\njury. On the left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for\nthe defense. In the middle of the court, near the judges, was a table\nwith the “material proofs.” On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch’s white silk\ndressing‐gown, stained with blood; the fatal brass pestle with which\nthe supposed murder had been committed; Mitya’s shirt, with a\nblood‐stained sleeve; his coat, stained with blood in patches over the\npocket in which he had put his handkerchief; the handkerchief itself,\nstiff with blood and by now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at\nPerhotin’s with a view to suicide, and taken from him on the sly at\nMokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand\nroubles had been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with\nwhich it had been tied, and many other articles I don’t remember. In\nthe body of the hall, at some distance, came the seats for the public.\nBut in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for\nwitnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence.",
            "6": "At ten o’clock the three judges arrived—the President, one honorary\njustice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, entered\nimmediately after. The President was a short, stout, thick‐set man of\nfifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut\nshort, and a red ribbon, of what Order I don’t remember. The prosecutor\nstruck me and the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost\ngreen. His face seemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a\nsingle night, for I had seen him looking as usual only two days before.\nThe President began with asking the court whether all the jury were\npresent.",
            "7": "But I see I can’t go on like this, partly because some things I did not\nhear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most of\nall because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space\nto mention everything that was said and done. I only know that neither\nside objected to very many of the jurymen. I remember the twelve\njurymen—four were petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and\nsix peasants and artisans of the town. I remember, long before the\ntrial, questions were continually asked with some surprise, especially\nby ladies: “Can such a delicate, complex and psychological case be\nsubmitted for decision to petty officials and even peasants?” and “What\ncan an official, still more a peasant, understand in such an affair?”\nAll the four officials in the jury were, in fact, men of no consequence\nand of low rank. Except one who was rather younger, they were\ngray‐headed men, little known in society, who had vegetated on a\npitiful salary, and who probably had elderly, unpresentable wives and\ncrowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and stockings. At most,\nthey spent their leisure over cards and, of course, had never read a\nsingle book. The two merchants looked respectable, but were strangely\nsilent and stolid. One of them was close‐shaven, and was dressed in\nEuropean style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a red\nribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need\nto speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans of\nSkotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of\nthem also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were\ndirtier and more uninviting‐looking than the others. So that one might\nwell wonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, “what men like\nthat could possibly make of such a case?” Yet their faces made a\nstrangely imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and\nfrowning.",
            "8": "At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor\nPavlovitch Karamazov. I don’t quite remember how he described him. The\ncourt usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his\nappearance. There was a hush through the court. One could have heard a\nfly. I don’t know how it was with others, but Mitya made a most\nunfavorable impression on me. He looked an awful dandy in a brand‐new\nfrock‐coat. I heard afterwards that he had ordered it in Moscow\nexpressly for the occasion from his own tailor, who had his measure. He\nwore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen. He walked in with\nhis yard‐long strides, looking stiffly straight in front of him, and\nsat down in his place with a most unperturbed air.\n\nAt the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated\nFetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the\ncourt. He was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely\nlong, thin, pale fingers, clean‐shaven face, demurely brushed, rather\nshort hair, and thin lips that were at times curved into something\nbetween a sneer and a smile. He looked about forty. His face would have\nbeen pleasant, if it had not been for his eyes, which, in themselves\nsmall and inexpressive, were set remarkably close together, with only\nthe thin, long nose as a dividing line between them. In fact, there was\nsomething strikingly birdlike about his face. He was in evening dress\nand white tie.\n\nI remember the President’s first questions to Mitya, about his name,\nhis calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was so\nunexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the\nprisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to\ntake part in the proceedings—that is, of the witnesses and experts. It\nwas a long list. Four of the witnesses were not present—Miüsov, who had\ngiven evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame\nHohlakov and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov,\nthrough his sudden death, of which an official statement from the\npolice was presented. The news of Smerdyakov’s death produced a sudden\nstir and whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not\nheard of the sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya’s sudden\noutburst. As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov’s death was made, he\ncried out aloud from his place:\n\n“He was a dog and died like a dog!”",
            "9": "I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President\naddressed him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an\nirregularity were repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice\nrepeated several times abruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret:\n\n“I won’t again, I won’t. It escaped me. I won’t do it again.”\n\nAnd, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the\npublic. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was\nunder the influence of this incident that the opening statement was\nread. It was rather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief\nreasons why he had been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet\nit made a great impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and\ndistinctly. The whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us,\nconcentrated, in bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless light. I remember\nhow, immediately after it had been read, the President asked Mitya in a\nloud impressive voice:\n\n“Prisoner, do you plead guilty?”\n\nMitya suddenly rose from his seat.\n\n“I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,” he exclaimed, again in\na startling, almost frenzied, voice, “to idleness and debauchery. I\nmeant to become an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was\nstruck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man,\nmy enemy and my father. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could\nnot be. Dmitri Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.”\n\nHe sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President again\nbriefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was\nasked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered\nthe case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath.\nThen I saw them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were,\nhowever, allowed to give evidence without taking the oath. After an\nexhortation from the priest and the President, the witnesses were led\naway and were made to sit as far as possible apart from one another.\nThen they began calling them up one by one."

            "0": "I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the\nprosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it\nwas arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. I\nonly know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first. I\nrepeat I don’t intend to describe all the questions step by step.\nBesides, my account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the\nspeeches for the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of\nthe evidence was brought together and set in a strong and significant\nlight, and I took down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full,\nand will quote them in due course, together with one extraordinary and\nquite unexpected episode, which occurred before the final speeches, and\nundoubtedly influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.",
            "1": "I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one\npeculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by\nall, that is, the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared\nwith the arguments the defense had to rely upon. Every one realized it\nfrom the first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a\nsingle point, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually\nrevealed. Every one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was\nbeyond dispute, that there was no doubt about it, that there could be\nreally no discussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form,\nand that the prisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I\nimagine that even the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the\nacquittal of the interesting prisoner, were at the same time, without\nexception, convinced of his guilt. What’s more, I believe they would\nhave been mortified if his guilt had not been so firmly established, as\nthat would have lessened the effect of the closing scene of the\ncriminal’s acquittal. That he would be acquitted, all the ladies,\nstrange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the very last moment. “He\nis guilty, but he will be acquitted, from motives of humanity, in\naccordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had come into\nfashion,” and so on, and so on. And that was why they had crowded into\nthe court so impatiently. The men were more interested in the contest\nbetween the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch. All were wondering\nand asking themselves what could even a talent like Fetyukovitch’s make\nof such a desperate case; and so they followed his achievements, step\nby step, with concentrated attention.",
            "2": "But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to\nhis speech. Persons of experience suspected that he had some design,\nthat he was working towards some object, but it was almost impossible\nto guess what it was. His confidence and self‐reliance were\nunmistakable, however. Every one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that\nhe, after so short a stay, not more than three days, perhaps, among us,\nhad so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the case and “had studied it\nto a nicety.” People described with relish, afterwards, how cleverly he\nhad “taken down” all the witnesses for the prosecution, and as far as\npossible perplexed them and, what’s more, had aspersed their reputation\nand so depreciated the value of their evidence. But it was supposed\nthat he did this rather by way of sport, so to speak, for professional\nglory, to show nothing had been omitted of the accepted methods, for\nall were convinced that he could do no real good by such disparagement\nof the witnesses, and probably was more aware of this than any one,\nhaving some idea of his own in the background, some concealed weapon of\ndefense, which he would suddenly reveal when the time came. But\nmeanwhile, conscious of his strength, he seemed to be diverting\nhimself.\n\nSo, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch’s old servant, who\nhad given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, was\nexamined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him when\nhis turn came to question him. It must be noted that Grigory entered\nthe hall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least\ndisconcerted by the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening\nto him. He gave evidence with as much confidence as though he had been\ntalking with his Marfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was\nimpossible to make him contradict himself. The prosecutor questioned\nhim first in detail about the family life of the Karamazovs. The family\npicture stood out in lurid colors. It was plain to ear and eye that the\nwitness was guileless and impartial. In spite of his profound reverence\nfor the memory of his deceased master, he yet bore witness that he had\nbeen unjust to Mitya and “hadn’t brought up his children as he should.\nHe’d have been devoured by lice when he was little, if it hadn’t been\nfor me,” he added, describing Mitya’s early childhood. “It wasn’t fair\neither of the father to wrong his son over his mother’s property, which\nwas by right his.”",
            "3": "In reply to the prosecutor’s question what grounds he had for asserting\nthat Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his son in their money relations,\nGrigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bring\nforward, but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son was\n“unfair,” and that he ought “to have paid him several thousand roubles\nmore.” I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this question\nwhether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mitya’s\ninheritance with marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be\nasked it, not excepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he obtained no exact\ninformation from any one; all alleged that it was so, but were unable\nto bring forward any distinct proof. Grigory’s description of the scene\nat the dinner‐table, when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father,\nthreatening to come back to kill him, made a sinister impression on the\ncourt, especially as the old servant’s composure in telling it, his\nparsimony of words and peculiar phraseology, were as effective as\neloquence. He observed that he was not angry with Mitya for having\nknocked him down and struck him on the face; he had forgiven him long\nago, he said. Of the deceased Smerdyakov he observed, crossing himself,\nthat he was a lad of ability, but stupid and afflicted, and, worse\nstill, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch and his elder son\nwho had taught him to be so. But he defended Smerdyakov’s honesty\nalmost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had once found the\nmaster’s money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it, had taken it\nto his master, who had rewarded him with a “gold piece” for it, and\ntrusted him implicitly from that time forward. He maintained\nobstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he was\nasked so many questions that I can’t recall them all.",
            "4": "At last the counsel for the defense began to cross‐examine him, and the\nfirst question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor\nPavlovitch was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for “a\ncertain person.” “Have you ever seen it, you, who were for so many\nyears in close attendance on your master?” Grigory answered that he had\nnot seen it and had never heard of the money from any one “till\neverybody was talking about it.” This question about the envelope\nFetyukovitch put to every one who could conceivably have known of it,\nas persistently as the prosecutor asked his question about Dmitri’s\ninheritance, and got the same answer from all, that no one had seen the\nenvelope, though many had heard of it. From the beginning every one\nnoticed Fetyukovitch’s persistence on this subject.\n\n“Now, with your permission I’ll ask you a question,” Fetyukovitch said,\nsuddenly and unexpectedly. “Of what was that balsam, or, rather,\ndecoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you\nused on that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?”\n\nGrigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence\nmuttered, “There was saffron in it.”\n\n“Nothing but saffron? Don’t you remember any other ingredient?”\n\n“There was milfoil in it, too.”\n\n“And pepper perhaps?” Fetyukovitch queried.\n\n“Yes, there was pepper, too.”\n\n“Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka?”\n\n“In spirit.”\n\nThere was a faint sound of laughter in the court.\n\n“You see, in spirit. After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank what\nwas left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to your\nwife?”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine‐glass or two?”\n\n“It might have been a tumbler‐full.”\n\n“A tumbler‐full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?”\n\nGrigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant.\n\n“A glass and a half of neat spirit—is not at all bad, don’t you think?\nYou might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the\ngarden?”\n\nGrigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The\nPresident made a movement.\n\n“Do you know for a fact,” Fetyukovitch persisted, “whether you were\nawake or not when you saw the open door?”\n\n“I was on my legs.”\n\n“That’s not a proof that you were awake.” (There was again laughter in\nthe court.) “Could you have answered at that moment, if any one had\nasked you a question—for instance, what year it is?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?”",
            "5": "Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor.\nStrange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was.\n\n“But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?”\n\n“I am a servant,” Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice.\n“If my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer\nit.”\n\nFetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened,\nreminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch\nbowed with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the\nwitness. The public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of\ndoubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while\nundergoing a certain cure, have seen “the gates of heaven,” and who did\nnot even know what year he was living in. But before Grigory left the\nbox another episode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner,\nasked him whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the\nlast witness.\n\n“Except about the door, all he has said is true,” cried Mitya, in a\nloud voice. “For combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my\nblows, I thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as\nfaithful to my father as seven hundred poodles.”\n\n“Prisoner, be careful in your language,” the President admonished him.\n\n“I am not a poodle,” Grigory muttered.\n\n“All right, it’s I am a poodle myself,” cried Mitya. “If it’s an\ninsult, I take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and\ncruel to him. I was cruel to Æsop too.”\n\n“What Æsop?” the President asked sternly again.\n\n“Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.”\n\nThe President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very\nsternly to be more careful in his language.\n\n“You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.”",
            "6": "The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the\nevidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading\nwitnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance.\nIt appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had\nbeen everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every\ndetail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of\nthe envelope, it is true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he\ndescribed minutely Mitya’s exploits in the “Metropolis,” all his\ncompromising doings and sayings, and told the story of Captain\nSnegiryov’s “wisp of tow.” But even Rakitin could say nothing positive\nabout Mitya’s inheritance, and confined himself to contemptuous\ngeneralities.\n\n“Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to\nthe other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no\none could make head or tail of it?” He attributed the tragic crime to\nthe habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the\ndistressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate\ninstitutions. He was, in fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This\nwas the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he could do, and\nattracted notice. The prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a\nmagazine article on the case, and afterwards in his speech, as we shall\nsee later, quoted some ideas from the article, showing that he had seen\nit already. The picture drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister\none, and greatly strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether,\nRakitin’s discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the\nextraordinary nobility of its ideas. There were even two or three\noutbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed\ncondition of Russia.\n\nBut Rakitin, in his youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which the\ncounsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage. Answering\ncertain questions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of\nhis own sentiments and his success, of which he was, of course,\nconscious, he went so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of\nAgrafena Alexandrovna as “the kept mistress of Samsonov.” He would have\ngiven a good deal to take back his words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch\ncaught him out over it at once. And it was all because Rakitin had not\nreckoned on the lawyer having been able to become so intimately\nacquainted with every detail in so short a time.",
            "7": "“Allow me to ask,” began the counsel for the defense, with the most\naffable and even respectful smile, “you are, of course, the same Mr.\nRakitin whose pamphlet, _The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father\nZossima_, published by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and\nreligious reflections and preceded by an excellent and devout\ndedication to the bishop, I have just read with such pleasure?”\n\n“I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,”\nmuttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost\nashamed.\n\n“Oh, that’s excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to,\ntake the widest view of every social question. Your most instructive\npamphlet has been widely circulated through the patronage of the\nbishop, and has been of appreciable service.... But this is the chief\nthing I should like to learn from you. You stated just now that you\nwere very intimately acquainted with Madame Svyetlov.” (It must be\nnoted that Grushenka’s surname was Svyetlov. I heard it for the first\ntime that day, during the case.)\n\n“I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and\nwho can be responsible for every one he meets?” cried Rakitin, flushing\nall over.\n\n“I understand, I quite understand,” cried Fetyukovitch, as though he,\ntoo, were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself. “You, like any\nother, might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and\nbeautiful woman who would readily entertain the _élite_ of the youth of\nthe neighborhood, but ... I only wanted to know ... It has come to my\nknowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of\nmonths ago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey\nFyodorovitch, and promised you twenty‐five roubles, if you would bring\nhim to her in his monastic dress. And that actually took place on the\nevening of the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of\nthe present investigation, was committed. You brought Alexey Karamazov\nto Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty‐five roubles from\nMadame Svyetlov as a reward, that’s what I wanted to hear from you?”\n\n“It was a joke.... I don’t see of what interest that can be to you....\nI took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later....”\n\n“Then you did take— But you have not given it back yet ... or have\nyou?”\n\n“That’s of no consequence,” muttered Rakitin, “I refuse to answer such\nquestions.... Of course I shall give it back.”",
            "8": "The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he had no more\nquestions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness‐box not\nabsolutely without a stain upon his character. The effect left by the\nlofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitch’s\nexpression, as he watched him walk away, seemed to suggest to the\npublic “this is a specimen of the lofty‐minded persons who accuse him.”\nI remember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an\noutbreak from Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred\nto Grushenka, he suddenly shouted “Bernard!” When, after Rakitin’s\ncross‐ examination, the President asked the prisoner if he had anything\nto say, Mitya cried loudly:\n\n“Since I’ve been arrested, he has borrowed money from me! He is a\ncontemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he doesn’t believe in God; he\ntook the bishop in!”\n\nMitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his\nlanguage, but Rakitin was done for. Captain Snegiryov’s evidence was a\nfailure, too, but from quite a different reason. He appeared in ragged\nand dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and\nexpert observation of the police officers, he turned out to be\nhopelessly drunk. On being asked about Mitya’s attack upon him, he\nrefused to answer.\n\n“God bless him. Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me\nyonder.”\n\n“Who told you not to tell? Of whom are you talking?”\n\n“Ilusha, my little son. ‘Father, father, how he insulted you!’ He said\nthat at the stone. Now he is dying....”\n\nThe captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his knees\nbefore the President. He was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of\nthe public. The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at\nall.",
            "9": "Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazed\npeople more and more by his minute knowledge of the case. Thus, for\nexample, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, very\nprejudicial to Mitya. He calculated almost on his fingers that on his\nfirst visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles,\n“or very little less. Just think what he squandered on those gypsy\ngirls alone! And as for our lousy peasants, it wasn’t a case of\nflinging half a rouble in the street, he made them presents of\ntwenty‐five roubles each, at least, he didn’t give them less. And what\na lot of money was simply stolen from him! And if any one did steal, he\ndid not leave a receipt. How could one catch the thief when he was\nflinging his money away all the time? Our peasants are robbers, you\nknow; they have no care for their souls. And the way he went on with\nthe girls, our village girls! They’re completely set up since then, I\ntell you, they used to be poor.” He recalled, in fact, every item of\nexpense and added it all up. So the theory that only fifteen hundred\nhad been spent and the rest had been put aside in a little bag seemed\ninconceivable.\n\n“I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands, I saw it with\nmy own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,” cried\nTrifon Borissovitch, doing his best to satisfy “his betters.”",
            "10": "When Fetyukovitch had to cross‐examine him, he scarcely tried to refute\nhis evidence, but began asking him about an incident at the first\ncarousal at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another\npeasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred\nroubles dropped by Mitya when he was drunk, and had given them to\nTrifon Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so.\n“Well,” asked the lawyer, “did you give that hundred roubles back to\nMr. Karamazov?” Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain.... He was\nobliged, after the peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of\nthe hundred roubles, only adding that he had religiously returned it\nall to Dmitri Fyodorovitch “in perfect honesty, and it’s only because\nhis honor was in liquor at the time, he wouldn’t remember it.” But, as\nhe had denied the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had\nbeen called to prove it, his evidence as to returning the money to\nMitya was naturally regarded with great suspicion. So one of the most\ndangerous witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again\ndiscredited.\n\nThe same thing happened with the Poles. They took up an attitude of\npride and independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been\nin the service of the Crown, and that “Pan Mitya” had offered them\nthree thousand “to buy their honor,” and that they had seen a large sum\nof money in his hands. Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number\nof Polish words into his sentences, and seeing that this only increased\nhis consequence in the eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew\nmore and more pompous, and ended by talking in Polish altogether. But\nFetyukovitch caught them, too, in his snares. Trifon Borissovitch,\nrecalled, was forced, in spite of his evasions, to admit that Pan\nVrublevsky had substituted another pack of cards for the one he had\nprovided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game.\nKalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left the witness‐box with\ndamaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.",
            "11": "Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous\nwitnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, and\ndismissing them with a certain derision. The lawyers and experts were\nlost in admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good\npurpose could be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case\nfor the prosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more\ntragically overwhelming. But from the confidence of the “great\nmagician” they saw that he was serene, and they waited, feeling that\n“such a man” had not come from Petersburg for nothing, and that he was\nnot a man to return unsuccessful."

        "content": {
            "0": "The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the\nprisoner. And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much\nupon it. The medical line of defense had only been taken up through the\ninsistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor\nfrom Moscow on purpose. The case for the defense could, of course, lose\nnothing by it and might, with luck, gain something from it. There was,\nhowever, an element of comedy about it, through the difference of\nopinion of the doctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from\nMoscow, our doctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky. The\ntwo latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nThe first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor\nHerzenstube. He was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle\nheight and sturdy build. He was much esteemed and respected by every\none in the town. He was a conscientious doctor and an excellent and\npious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not quite sure which.\nHe had been living amongst us for many years and behaved with wonderful\ndignity. He was a kind‐hearted and humane man. He treated the sick poor\nand peasants for nothing, visited them in their slums and huts, and\nleft money for medicine, but he was as obstinate as a mule. If once he\nhad taken an idea into his head, there was no shaking it. Almost every\none in the town was aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had,\nwithin the first two or three days of his presence among us, uttered\nsome extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube’s\nqualifications. Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty‐five roubles for\na visit, several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his\narrival, and rushed to consult him regardless of expense. All these\nhad, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and the\ncelebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme harshness.\nFinally, he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them, “Well, who\nhas been cramming you with nostrums? Herzenstube? He, he!” Doctor\nHerzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three doctors\nmade their appearance, one after another, to be examined.",
            "1": "Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the\nprisoner’s mental faculties was self‐evident. Then giving his grounds\nfor this opinion, which I omit here, he added that the abnormality was\nnot only evident in many of the prisoner’s actions in the past, but was\napparent even now at this very moment. When he was asked to explain how\nit was apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple‐hearted\ndirectness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had “an\nextraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances”; that he had\n“marched in like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it\nwould have been more natural for him to look to the left where, among\nthe public, the ladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer\nof the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying\nof him now,” the old man concluded in his peculiar language.\n\nI must add that he spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed\nin German style, which did not, however, trouble him, for it had always\nbeen a weakness of his to believe that he spoke Russian perfectly,\nbetter indeed than Russians. And he was very fond of using Russian\nproverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and\nmost expressive sayings in the whole world. I may remark, too, that in\nconversation, through absent‐mindedness he often forgot the most\nordinary words, which sometimes went out of his head, though he knew\nthem perfectly. The same thing happened, though, when he spoke German,\nand at such times he always waved his hand before his face as though\ntrying to catch the lost word, and no one could induce him to go on\nspeaking till he had found the missing word. His remark that the\nprisoner ought to have looked at the ladies on entering roused a\nwhisper of amusement in the audience. All our ladies were very fond of\nour old doctor; they knew, too, that having been all his life a\nbachelor and a religious man of exemplary conduct, he looked upon women\nas lofty creatures. And so his unexpected observation struck every one\nas very queer.",
            "2": "The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his turn, definitely and\nemphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner’s mental\ncondition abnormal in the highest degree. He talked at length and with\nerudition of “aberration” and “mania,” and argued that, from all the\nfacts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of\naberration for several days before his arrest, and, if the crime had\nbeen committed by him, it must, even if he were conscious of it, have\nbeen almost involuntary, as he had not the power to control the morbid\nimpulse that possessed him.\n\nBut apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which\npremised, in his words, to lead to complete insanity in the future. (It\nmust be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use\nof very learned and professional language.) “All his actions are in\ncontravention of common sense and logic,” he continued. “Not to refer\nto what I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole\ncatastrophe, the day before yesterday, while he was talking to me, he\nhad an unaccountably fixed look in his eye. He laughed unexpectedly\nwhen there was nothing to laugh at. He showed continual and\ninexplicable irritability, using strange words, ‘Bernard!’ ‘Ethics!’\nand others equally inappropriate.” But the doctor detected mania, above\nall, in the fact that the prisoner could not even speak of the three\nthousand roubles, of which he considered himself to have been cheated,\nwithout extraordinary irritation, though he could speak comparatively\nlightly of other misfortunes and grievances. According to all accounts,\nhe had even in the past, whenever the subject of the three thousand\nroubles was touched on, flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he was\nreported to be a disinterested and not grasping man.",
            "3": "“As to the opinion of my learned colleague,” the Moscow doctor added\nironically in conclusion, “that the prisoner would, on entering the\ncourt, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him,\nI will only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is\nradically unsound. For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on\nentering the court where his fate will be decided, would not naturally\nlook straight before him in that fixed way, and that that may really be\na sign of his abnormal mental condition, at the same time I maintain\nthat he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies, but, on the\ncontrary, to the right to find his legal adviser, on whose help all his\nhopes rest and on whose defense all his future depends.” The doctor\nexpressed his opinion positively and emphatically.\n\nBut the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last\ntouch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts. In\nhis opinion the prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a\nperfectly normal condition, and, although he certainly must have been\nin a nervous and exceedingly excited state before his arrest, this\nmight have been due to several perfectly obvious causes, jealousy,\nanger, continual drunkenness, and so on. But this nervous condition\nwould not involve the mental aberration of which mention had just been\nmade. As to the question whether the prisoner should have looked to the\nleft or to the right on entering the court, “in his modest opinion,”\nthe prisoner would naturally look straight before him on entering the\ncourt, as he had in fact done, as that was where the judges, on whom\nhis fate depended, were sitting. So that it was just by looking\nstraight before him that he showed his perfectly normal state of mind\nat the present. The young doctor concluded his “modest” testimony with\nsome heat.\n\n“Bravo, doctor!” cried Mitya, from his seat, “just so!”\n\nMitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor’s opinion had a\ndecisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appeared\nafterwards, every one agreed with him. But Doctor Herzenstube, when\ncalled as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya. As an old\nresident in the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he\nfurnished some facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly,\nas though recalling something, he added:",
            "4": "“But the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he\nhad a good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know.\nBut the Russian proverb says, ‘If a man has one head, it’s good, but if\nanother clever man comes to visit him, it would be better still, for\nthen there will be two heads and not only one.’ ”\n\n“One head is good, but two are better,” the prosecutor put in\nimpatiently. He knew the old man’s habit of talking slowly and\ndeliberately, regardless of the impression he was making and of the\ndelay he was causing, and highly prizing his flat, dull and always\ngleefully complacent German wit. The old man was fond of making jokes.\n\n“Oh, yes, that’s what I say,” he went on stubbornly. “One head is good,\nbut two are much better, but he did not meet another head with wits,\nand his wits went. Where did they go? I’ve forgotten the word.” He went\non, passing his hand before his eyes, “Oh, yes, _spazieren_.”\n\n“Wandering?”\n\n“Oh, yes, wandering, that’s what I say. Well, his wits went wandering\nand fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself. And yet he was a\ngrateful and sensitive boy. Oh, I remember him very well, a little chap\nso high, left neglected by his father in the back yard, when he ran\nabout without boots on his feet, and his little breeches hanging by one\nbutton.”\n\nA note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old\nman’s voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting\nsomething, and caught at it instantly.\n\n“Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty‐five\nthen, and had only just come here. And I was so sorry for the boy then;\nI asked myself why shouldn’t I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what?\nI’ve forgotten what it’s called. A pound of what children are very fond\nof, what is it, what is it?” The doctor began waving his hands again.\n“It grows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one....”\n\n“Apples?”\n\n“Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are\na lot of them, and all little. You put them in the mouth and crack.”\n\n“Nuts?”",
            "5": "“Quite so, nuts, I say so.” The doctor repeated in the calmest way as\nthough he had been at no loss for a word. “And I bought him a pound of\nnuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before. And I\nlifted my finger and said to him, ‘Boy, _Gott der Vater_.’ He laughed\nand said, ‘_Gott der Vater_.’... ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ He laughed again\nand lisped, ‘_Gott der Sohn_.’ ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ Then he\nlaughed and said as best he could, ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ I went\naway, and two days after I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me\nof himself, ‘Uncle, _Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_,’ and he had only\nforgotten ‘_Gott der heilige Geist_.’ But I reminded him of it and I\nfelt very sorry for him again. But he was taken away, and I did not see\nhim again. Twenty‐ three years passed. I am sitting one morning in my\nstudy, a white‐haired old man, when there walks into the room a\nblooming young man, whom I should never have recognized, but he held up\nhis finger and said, laughing, ‘_Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn_, and\n_Gott der heilige Geist_. I have just arrived and have come to thank\nyou for that pound of nuts, for no one else ever bought me a pound of\nnuts; you are the only one that ever did.’ And then I remembered my\nhappy youth and the poor child in the yard, without boots on his feet,\nand my heart was touched and I said, ‘You are a grateful young man, for\nyou have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you in\nyour childhood.’ And I embraced him and blessed him. And I shed tears.\nHe laughed, but he shed tears, too ... for the Russian often laughs\nwhen he ought to be weeping. But he did weep; I saw it. And now,\nalas!...”\n\n“And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,”\nMitya cried suddenly.\n\nIn any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the\npublic. But the chief sensation in Mitya’s favor was created by the\nevidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,\nwhen the witnesses _à décharge_, that is, called by the defense, began\ngiving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to\nMitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to\nthe counsel for the defense. But before Katerina Ivanovna was called,\nAlyosha was examined, and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish\npositive evidence against one important point made by the prosecution."

            "0": "It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He was not\nrequired to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him\nvery gently and sympathetically. It was evident that his reputation for\ngoodness had preceded him. Alyosha gave his evidence modestly and with\nrestraint, but his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was\nunmistakable. In answer to one question, he sketched his brother’s\ncharacter as that of a man, violent‐tempered perhaps and carried away\nby his passions, but at the same time honorable, proud and generous,\ncapable of self‐sacrifice, if necessary. He admitted, however, that,\nthrough his passion for Grushenka and his rivalry with his father, his\nbrother had been of late in an intolerable position. But he repelled\nwith indignation the suggestion that his brother might have committed a\nmurder for the sake of gain, though he recognized that the three\nthousand roubles had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that he\nlooked upon them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by\nhis father, and that, indifferent as he was to money as a rule, he\ncould not even speak of that three thousand without fury. As for the\nrivalry of the two “ladies,” as the prosecutor expressed it—that is, of\nGrushenka and Katya—he answered evasively and was even unwilling to\nanswer one or two questions altogether.\n\n“Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he intended to kill your\nfather?” asked the prosecutor. “You can refuse to answer if you think\nnecessary,” he added.\n\n“He did not tell me so directly,” answered Alyosha.\n\n“How so? Did he indirectly?”\n\n“He spoke to me once of his hatred for our father and his fear that at\nan extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might perhaps murder\nhim.”\n\n“And you believed him?”\n\n“I am afraid to say that I did. But I never doubted that some higher\nfeeling would always save him at the fatal moment, as it has indeed\nsaved him, for it was not he killed my father,” Alyosha said firmly, in\na loud voice that was heard throughout the court.\n\nThe prosecutor started like a war‐horse at the sound of a trumpet.",
            "1": "“Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of\nyour conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your\naffection for your unhappy brother. Your peculiar view of the whole\ntragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary\ninvestigation. I won’t attempt to conceal from you that it is highly\nindividual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the\nprosecution. And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what\nfacts have led you to this conviction of your brother’s innocence and\nof the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the\npreliminary inquiry?”\n\n“I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,”\nreplied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. “I made no accusation against\nSmerdyakov of myself.”\n\n“Yet you gave evidence against him?”\n\n“I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri’s words. I was told what took\nplace at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was\nexamined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he\ndidn’t commit the murder, then—”\n\n“Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely\npersuaded of your brother’s innocence?”\n\n“I cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn’t lie to me. I\nsaw from his face he wasn’t lying.”\n\n“Only from his face? Is that all the proof you have?”\n\n“I have no other proof.”\n\n“And of Smerdyakov’s guilt you have no proof whatever but your\nbrother’s word and the expression of his face?”\n\n“No, I have no other proof.”\n\nThe prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression\nleft by Alyosha’s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There\nhad been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard\nsomething, some one had pointed out something else, it was said that\nAlyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his\nbrother’s innocence and Smerdyakov’s guilt, and after all there was\nnothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a\nbrother.\n\nBut Fetyukovitch began his cross‐examination. On his asking Alyosha\nwhen it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father\nand that he might kill him, and whether he had heard it, for instance,\nat their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he\nanswered, as though only just recollecting and understanding something.\n\n“I remember one circumstance now which I’d quite forgotten myself. It\nwasn’t clear to me at the time, but now—”",
            "2": "And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he\nrecounted eagerly how, at his last interview with Mitya that evening\nunder the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself\non the breast, “the upper part of the breast,” and had repeated several\ntimes that he had a means of regaining his honor, that that means was\nhere, here on his breast. “I thought, when he struck himself on the\nbreast, he meant that it was in his heart,” Alyosha continued, “that he\nmight find in his heart strength to save himself from some awful\ndisgrace which was awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even\nto me. I must confess I did think at the time that he was speaking of\nour father, and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought\nof going to our father and doing some violence to him. Yet it was just\nthen that he pointed to something on his breast, so that I remember the\nidea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the\nbreast, but below, and that he struck himself much too high, just below\nthe neck, and kept pointing to that place. My idea seemed silly to me\nat the time, but he was perhaps pointing then to that little bag in\nwhich he had fifteen hundred roubles!”\n\n“Just so,” Mitya cried from his place. “That’s right, Alyosha, it was\nthe little bag I struck with my fist.”\n\nFetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet, and\nat the same instant pounced on Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself\nby his recollection, warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was\nprobably just that fifteen hundred roubles on him, which he might have\nreturned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he owed her, but which he\nhad yet determined not to repay her and to use for another\npurpose—namely, to enable him to elope with Grushenka, if she\nconsented.\n\n“It is so, it must be so,” exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. “My\nbrother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it (he\nsaid _half_ several times) he could free himself from at once, but that\nhe was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldn’t do it ...\nthat he knew beforehand he was incapable of doing it!”\n\n“And you clearly, confidently remember that he struck himself just on\nthis part of the breast?” Fetyukovitch asked eagerly.",
            "3": "“Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, ‘Why does he\nstrike himself up there when the heart is lower down?’ and the thought\nseemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ...\nit flashed through my mind. That’s what brought it back to me just now.\nHow could I have forgotten it till now? It was that little bag he meant\nwhen he said he had the means but wouldn’t give back that fifteen\nhundred. And when he was arrested at Mokroe he cried out—I know, I was\ntold it—that he considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that\nwhen he had the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!)\nwhat he owed her, he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and\npreferred to remain a thief in her eyes rather than part with it. And\nwhat torture, what torture that debt has been to him!” Alyosha\nexclaimed in conclusion.\n\nThe prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to describe\nonce more how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the\nquestion, “Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything? Perhaps he had\nsimply struck himself with his fist on the breast?”\n\n“But it was not with his fist,” cried Alyosha; “he pointed with his\nfingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have so\ncompletely forgotten it till this moment?”\n\nThe President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last witness’s\nevidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been pointing to the\nfifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast, just below the neck,\nand that that was, of course, the disgrace, “A disgrace I cannot deny,\nthe most shameful act of my whole life,” cried Mitya. “I might have\nrepaid it and didn’t repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her\neyes rather than give it back. And the most shameful part of it was\nthat I knew beforehand I shouldn’t give it back! You are right,\nAlyosha! Thanks, Alyosha!”",
            "4": "So Alyosha’s cross‐examination ended. What was important and striking\nabout it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though\nthis were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it\ndid go some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had\ncontained fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been\nlying at the preliminary inquiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those\nfifteen hundred roubles were “his own.” Alyosha was glad. With a\nflushed face he moved away to the seat assigned to him. He kept\nrepeating to himself: “How was it I forgot? How could I have forgotten\nit? And what made it come back to me now?”\n\nKaterina Ivanovna was called to the witness‐box. As she entered\nsomething extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched\ntheir lorgnettes and opera‐glasses. There was a stir among the men:\nsome stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards that\nMitya had turned “white as a sheet” on her entrance. All in black, she\nadvanced modestly, almost timidly. It was impossible to tell from her\nface that she was agitated; but there was a resolute gleam in her dark\nand gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people mentioned that she\nlooked particularly handsome at that moment. She spoke softly but\nclearly, so that she was heard all over the court. She expressed\nherself with composure, or at least tried to appear composed. The\nPresident began his examination discreetly and very respectfully, as\nthough afraid to touch on “certain chords,” and showing consideration\nfor her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first questions\nKaterina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly betrothed\nto the prisoner, “until he left me of his own accord...” she added\nquietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted\nto Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, “I didn’t give him\nthe money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in\ngreat need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the\nunderstanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to.\nThere was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.”\n\nI will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in\ndetail. I will only give the substance of her evidence.",
            "5": "“I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he\ngot money from his father,” she went on. “I have never doubted his\ndisinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in\nmoney matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money\nfrom his father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had\na feud with his father and have always believed that he had been\nunfairly treated by his father. I don’t remember any threat uttered by\nhim against his father. He certainly never uttered any such threat\nbefore me. If he had come to me at that time, I should have at once\nrelieved his anxiety about that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he\nhad given up coming to see me ... and I myself was put in such a\nposition ... that I could not invite him.... And I had no right,\nindeed, to be exacting as to that money,” she added suddenly, and there\nwas a ring of resolution in her voice. “I was once indebted to him for\nassistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it,\nalthough I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a\nposition to repay my debt.”\n\nThere was a note of defiance in her voice. It was then Fetyukovitch\nbegan his cross‐examination.\n\n“Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your\nacquaintance?” Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his way,\ninstantly scenting something favorable. I must mention in parenthesis\nthat, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at\nthe instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he knew nothing about the\nepisode of the four thousand roubles given her by Mitya, and of her\n“bowing to the ground to him.” She concealed this from him and said\nnothing about it, and that was strange. It may be pretty certainly\nassumed that she herself did not know till the very last minute whether\nshe would speak of that episode in the court, and waited for the\ninspiration of the moment.",
            "6": "No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her story. She\ntold everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her\nbowing to the ground, and her reason. She told about her father and her\ngoing to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that\nMitya had himself, through her sister, proposed they should “send him\nKaterina Ivanovna” to fetch the money. She generously concealed that\nand was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own\nimpulse run to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him\nfor the money. It was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled\nas I listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch each word. It was\nsomething unexampled. Even from such a self‐willed and contemptuously\nproud girl as she was, such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice,\nsuch self‐immolation, seemed incredible. And for what, for whom? To\nsave the man who had deceived and insulted her and to help, in however\nsmall a degree, in saving him, by creating a strong impression in his\nfavor. And, indeed, the figure of the young officer who, with a\nrespectful bow to the innocent girl, handed her his last four thousand\nroubles—all he had in the world—was thrown into a very sympathetic and\nattractive light, but ... I had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt\nthat calumny might come of it later (and it did, in fact, it did). It\nwas repeated all over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that\nthe story was perhaps not quite complete—that is, in the statement that\nthe officer had let the young lady depart “with nothing but a\nrespectful bow.” It was hinted that something was here omitted.\n\n“And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,”\nthe most highly respected of our ladies maintained, “even then it’s\nvery doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in\nthat way, even for the sake of saving her father.”",
            "7": "And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her intelligence, her morbid\nsensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like\nthat? She must have understood it, yet she made up her mind to tell\neverything. Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the\ntruth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all\nwere deeply impressed by it. As for the judges and the lawyers, they\nlistened in reverent, almost shame‐faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna.\nThe prosecutor did not venture upon even one question on the subject.\nFetyukovitch made a low bow to her. Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much\nground had been gained. For a man to give his last four thousand on a\ngenerous impulse and then for the same man to murder his father for the\nsake of robbing him of three thousand—the idea seemed too incongruous.\nFetyukovitch felt that now the charge of theft, at least, was as good\nas disproved. “The case” was thrown into quite a different light. There\nwas a wave of sympathy for Mitya. As for him.... I was told that once\nor twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her evidence, he jumped up\nfrom his seat, sank back again, and hid his face in his hands. But when\nshe had finished, he suddenly cried in a sobbing voice:\n\n“Katya, why have you ruined me?” and his sobs were audible all over the\ncourt. But he instantly restrained himself, and cried again:\n\n“Now I am condemned!”\n\nThen he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms\nacross his chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down\nin her place. She was pale and sat with her eyes cast down. Those who\nwere sitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all\nover as though in a fever. Grushenka was called.\n\nI am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final\ncause of Mitya’s ruin. For I am convinced, so is every one—all the\nlawyers said the same afterwards—that if the episode had not occurred,\nthe prisoner would at least have been recommended to mercy. But of that\nlater. A few words first about Grushenka.",
            "8": "She, too, was dressed entirely in black, with her magnificent black\nshawl on her shoulders. She walked to the witness‐box with her smooth,\nnoiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full\nfigure. She looked steadily at the President, turning her eyes neither\nto the right nor to the left. To my thinking she looked very handsome\nat that moment, and not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards.\nThey declared, too, that she had a concentrated and spiteful\nexpression. I believe that she was simply irritated and painfully\nconscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive eyes of our\nscandal‐loving public. She was proud and could not stand contempt. She\nwas one of those people who flare up, angry and eager to retaliate, at\nthe mere suggestion of contempt. There was an element of timidity, too,\nof course, and inward shame at her own timidity, so it was not strange\nthat her tone kept changing. At one moment it was angry, contemptuous\nand rough, and at another there was a sincere note of self‐\ncondemnation. Sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a desperate\nplunge; as though she felt, “I don’t care what happens, I’ll say\nit....” Apropos of her acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she\nremarked curtly, “That’s all nonsense, and was it my fault that he\nwould pester me?” But a minute later she added, “It was all my fault. I\nwas laughing at them both—at the old man and at him, too—and I brought\nboth of them to this. It was all on account of me it happened.”\n\nSamsonov’s name came up somehow. “That’s nobody’s business,” she\nsnapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance. “He was my\nbenefactor; he took me when I hadn’t a shoe to my foot, when my family\nhad turned me out.” The President reminded her, though very politely,\nthat she must answer the questions directly, without going off into\nirrelevant details. Grushenka crimsoned and her eyes flashed.\n\nThe envelope with the notes in it she had not seen, but had only heard\nfrom “that wicked wretch” that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with\nnotes for three thousand in it. “But that was all foolishness. I was\nonly laughing. I wouldn’t have gone to him for anything.”\n\n“To whom are you referring as ‘that wicked wretch’?” inquired the\nprosecutor.\n\n“The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his master and hanged himself\nlast night.”\n\nShe was, of course, at once asked what ground she had for such a\ndefinite accusation; but it appeared that she, too, had no grounds for\nit.",
            "9": "“Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him. The woman\nwho came between us has ruined him; she is the cause of it all, let me\ntell you,” Grushenka added. She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and\nthere was a vindictive note in her voice.\n\nShe was again asked to whom she was referring.\n\n“The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She sent for me, offered me\nchocolate, tried to fascinate me. There’s not much true shame about\nher, I can tell you that....”\n\nAt this point the President checked her sternly, begging her to\nmoderate her language. But the jealous woman’s heart was burning, and\nshe did not care what she did.\n\n“When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,” the prosecutor asked,\n“every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out:\n‘It’s all my fault. We’ll go to Siberia together!’ So you already\nbelieved him to have murdered his father?”\n\n“I don’t remember what I felt at the time,” answered Grushenka. “Every\none was crying out that he had killed his father, and I felt that it\nwas my fault, that it was on my account he had murdered him. But when\nhe said he wasn’t guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now\nand always shall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.”\n\nFetyukovitch began his cross‐examination. I remember that among other\nthings he asked about Rakitin and the twenty‐five roubles “you paid him\nfor bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.”\n\n“There was nothing strange about his taking the money,” sneered\nGrushenka, with angry contempt. “He was always coming to me for money:\nhe used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for\nluxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.”\n\n“What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?” Fetyukovitch asked, in\nspite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.\n\n“Why, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother’s sister. But he’s\nalways besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully\nashamed of me.”",
            "10": "This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor\nin the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin\nturned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard\nbefore she came into the court that he had given evidence against\nMitya, and so she was angry. The whole effect on the public, of\nRakitin’s speech, of his noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom\nand the political disorder of Russia, was this time finally ruined.\nFetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend. Grushenka’s\ncross‐examination did not last long and, of course, there could be\nnothing particularly new in her evidence. She left a very disagreeable\nimpression on the public; hundreds of contemptuous eyes were fixed upon\nher, as she finished giving her evidence and sat down again in the\ncourt, at a good distance from Katerina Ivanovna. Mitya was silent\nthroughout her evidence. He sat as though turned to stone, with his\neyes fixed on the ground.\n\nIvan was called to give evidence."

            "0": "I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But the usher of the\ncourt announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or\nsome sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was\nready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered. But no one seemed\nto have heard it and it only came out later.\n\nHis entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal\nwitnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been\nquestioned. Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was\nfeeling almost fatigued. Several more witnesses were still to be heard,\nwho probably had little information to give after all that had been\ngiven. Time was passing. Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness,\nlooking at no one, and with his head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy\nthought. He was irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful\nimpression, on me at least: there was an earthy look in it, a look like\na dying man’s. His eyes were lusterless; he raised them and looked\nslowly round the court. Alyosha jumped up from his seat and moaned\n“Ah!” I remember that, but it was hardly noticed.\n\nThe President began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath,\nthat he might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he must\nbear witness according to his conscience, and so on, and so on. Ivan\nlistened and looked at him blankly, but his face gradually relaxed into\na smile, and as soon as the President, looking at him in astonishment,\nfinished, he laughed outright.\n\n“Well, and what else?” he asked in a loud voice.\n\nThere was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something\nstrange. The President showed signs of uneasiness.\n\n“You ... are perhaps still unwell?” he began, looking everywhere for\nthe usher.\n\n“Don’t trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell\nyou something interesting,” Ivan answered with sudden calmness and\nrespectfulness.\n\n“You have some special communication to make?” the President went on,\nstill mistrustfully.\n\nIvan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his head, answered,\nalmost stammering:\n\n“No ... I haven’t. I have nothing particular.”",
            "1": "They began asking him questions. He answered, as it were, reluctantly,\nwith extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more\nmarked, though he answered rationally. To many questions he answered\nthat he did not know. He knew nothing of his father’s money relations\nwith Dmitri. “I wasn’t interested in the subject,” he added. Threats to\nmurder his father he had heard from the prisoner. Of the money in the\nenvelope he had heard from Smerdyakov.\n\n“The same thing over and over again,” he interrupted suddenly, with a\nlook of weariness. “I have nothing particular to tell the court.”\n\n“I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,” the President\nbegan.\n\nHe turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite\nthem to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in\nan exhausted voice:\n\n“Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill.”\n\nAnd with these words, without waiting for permission, he turned to walk\nout of the court. But after taking four steps he stood still, as though\nhe had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back.\n\n“I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it\ngo? ‘I’ll stand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’ They were trying\nto put on her sarafan to take her to church to be married, and she\nsaid, ‘I’ll stand up if I like, and I won’t if I don’t.’... It’s in\nsome book about the peasantry.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” the President asked severely.\n\n“Why, this,” Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. “Here’s the\nmoney ... the notes that lay in that envelope” (he nodded towards the\ntable on which lay the material evidence), “for the sake of which our\nfather was murdered. Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take\nthem.”\n\nThe usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the\nPresident.\n\n“How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same\nmoney?” the President asked wonderingly.\n\n“I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was\nwith him just before he hanged himself. It was he, not my brother,\nkilled our father. He murdered him and I incited him to do it ... Who\ndoesn’t desire his father’s death?”\n\n“Are you in your right mind?” broke involuntarily from the President.",
            "2": "“I should think I am in my right mind ... in the same nasty mind as all\nof you ... as all these ... ugly faces.” He turned suddenly to the\naudience. “My father has been murdered and they pretend they are\nhorrified,” he snarled, with furious contempt. “They keep up the sham\nwith one another. Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers.\nOne reptile devours another.... If there hadn’t been a murder, they’d\nhave been angry and gone home ill‐humored. It’s a spectacle they want!\n_Panem et circenses_. Though I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give\nme a drink for Christ’s sake!” He suddenly clutched his head.\n\nThe usher at once approached him. Alyosha jumped up and cried, “He is\nill. Don’t believe him: he has brain fever.” Katerina Ivanovna rose\nimpulsively from her seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya\nstood up and greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a\nwild, strange smile.\n\n“Don’t disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,” Ivan\nbegan again. “You can’t expect eloquence from a murderer,” he added\nsuddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh.\n\nThe prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two\nother judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up\nhis ears as he listened: the hall was hushed in expectation. The\nPresident seemed suddenly to recollect himself.\n\n“Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm\nyourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have\nsomething to tell. How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you\nare not delirious?”\n\n“That’s just it. I have no proof. That cur Smerdyakov won’t send you\nproofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing\nbut envelopes—one is enough. I’ve no witnesses ... except one,\nperhaps,” he smiled thoughtfully.\n\n“Who is your witness?”",
            "3": "“He has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular! _Le\ndiable n’existe point!_ Don’t pay attention: he is a paltry, pitiful\ndevil,” he added suddenly. He ceased laughing and spoke as it were,\nconfidentially. “He is here somewhere, no doubt—under that table with\nthe material evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he sit if not there?\nYou see, listen to me. I told him I don’t want to keep quiet, and he\ntalked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy! Come, release the\nmonster ... he’s been singing a hymn. That’s because his heart is\nlight! It’s like a drunken man in the street bawling how ‘Vanka went to\nPetersburg,’ and I would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two\nseconds of joy. You don’t know me! Oh, how stupid all this business is!\nCome, take me instead of him! I didn’t come for nothing.... Why, why is\neverything so stupid?...”\n\nAnd he began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him\nagain. But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards\nhim, but the court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.\n\n“What are you about?” he cried, staring into the man’s face, and\nsuddenly seizing him by the shoulders, he flung him violently to the\nfloor. But the police were on the spot and he was seized. He screamed\nfuriously. And all the time he was being removed, he yelled and\nscreamed something incoherent.\n\nThe whole court was thrown into confusion. I don’t remember everything\nas it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow. I only know\nthat afterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one\nunderstood what had happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand,\nthough he very reasonably explained that the witness had been quite\nwell, that the doctor had seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight\nattack of giddiness, but that, until he had come into the court, he had\ntalked quite consecutively, so that nothing could have been\nforeseen—that he had, in fact, insisted on giving evidence. But before\nevery one had completely regained their composure and recovered from\nthis scene, it was followed by another. Katerina Ivanovna had an attack\nof hysterics. She sobbed, shrieking loudly, but refused to leave the\ncourt, struggled, and besought them not to remove her. Suddenly she\ncried to the President:",
            "4": "“There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a\ndocument, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly! It’s a letter\nfrom that monster ... that man there, there!” she pointed to Mitya. “It\nwas he killed his father, you will see that directly. He wrote to me\nhow he would kill his father! But the other one is ill, he is ill, he\nis delirious!” she kept crying out, beside herself.\n\nThe court usher took the document she held out to the President, and\nshe, dropping into her chair, hiding her face in her hands, began\nconvulsively and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling\nevery sound for fear she should be ejected from the court. The document\nshe had handed up was that letter Mitya had written at the “Metropolis”\ntavern, which Ivan had spoken of as a “mathematical proof.” Alas! its\nmathematical conclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for\nthat letter, Mitya might have escaped his doom or, at least, that doom\nwould have been less terrible. It was, I repeat, difficult to notice\nevery detail. What followed is still confused to my mind. The President\nmust, I suppose, have at once passed on the document to the judges, the\njury, and the lawyers on both sides. I only remember how they began\nexamining the witness. On being gently asked by the President whether\nshe had recovered sufficiently, Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed\nimpetuously:\n\n“I am ready, I am ready! I am quite equal to answering you,” she added,\nevidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving\nevidence. She was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and\nunder what circumstances she received it.",
            "5": "“I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he wrote it\nthe day before that, at the tavern—that is, two days before he\ncommitted the crime. Look, it is written on some sort of bill!” she\ncried breathlessly. “He hated me at that time, because he had behaved\ncontemptibly and was running after that creature ... and because he\nowed me that three thousand.... Oh! he was humiliated by that three\nthousand on account of his own meanness! This is how it happened about\nthat three thousand. I beg you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks\nbefore he murdered his father, he came to me one morning. I knew he was\nin want of money, and what he wanted it for. Yes, yes—to win that\ncreature and carry her off. I knew then that he had been false to me\nand meant to abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him that money, who\noffered it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my sister in\nMoscow. And as I gave it him, I looked him in the face and said that he\ncould send it when he liked, ‘in a month’s time would do.’ How, how\ncould he have failed to understand that I was practically telling him\nto his face, ‘You want money to be false to me with your creature, so\nhere’s the money for you. I give it to you myself. Take it, if you have\nso little honor as to take it!’ I wanted to prove what he was, and what\nhappened? He took it, he took it, and squandered it with that creature\nin one night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all about it. I\nassure you he understood, too, that I gave him that money to test him,\nto see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take it from\nme. I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine, and he understood\nit all and he took it—he carried off my money!”\n\n“That’s true, Katya,” Mitya roared suddenly, “I looked into your eyes\nand I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money.\nDespise me as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I’ve deserved it!”\n\n“Prisoner,” cried the President, “another word and I will order you to\nbe removed.”",
            "6": "“That money was a torment to him,” Katya went on with impulsive haste.\n“He wanted to repay it me. He wanted to, that’s true; but he needed\nmoney for that creature, too. So he murdered his father, but he didn’t\nrepay me, and went off with her to that village where he was arrested.\nThere, again, he squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of\nhis father. And a day before the murder he wrote me this letter. He was\ndrunk when he wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time. He wrote it from\nspite, and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never\nshow it to any one, even if he did kill him, or else he wouldn’t have\nwritten it. For he knew I shouldn’t want to revenge myself and ruin\nhim! But read it, read it attentively—more attentively, please—and you\nwill see that he had described it all in his letter, all beforehand,\nhow he would kill his father and where his money was kept. Look,\nplease, don’t overlook that, there’s one phrase there, ‘I shall kill\nhim as soon as Ivan has gone away.’ So he thought it all out beforehand\nhow he would kill him,” Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with\nvenomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every\nline of that letter and detected every meaning underlining it. “If he\nhadn’t been drunk, he wouldn’t have written to me; but, look,\neverything is written there beforehand, just as he committed the murder\nafter. A complete program of it!” she exclaimed frantically.\n\nShe was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt,\nshe had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking\nwith anger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not.\nNow she had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read\naloud by the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an\noverwhelming impression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having\nwritten the letter.\n\n“It’s mine, mine!” cried Mitya. “I shouldn’t have written it, if I\nhadn’t been drunk!... We’ve hated each other for many things, Katya,\nbut I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn’t\nlove me!”\n\nHe sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair. The prosecutor\nand counsel for the defense began cross‐examining her, chiefly to\nascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give\nher evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.",
            "7": "“Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. I was lying against my honor\nand my conscience, but I wanted to save him, for he has hated and\ndespised me so!” Katya cried madly. “Oh, he has despised me horribly,\nhe has always despised me, and do you know, he has despised me from the\nvery moment that I bowed down to him for that money. I saw that.... I\nfelt it at once at the time, but for a long time I wouldn’t believe it.\nHow often I have read it in his eyes, ‘You came of yourself, though.’\nOh, he didn’t understand, he had no idea why I ran to him, he can\nsuspect nothing but baseness, he judged me by himself, he thought every\none was like himself!” Katya hissed furiously, in a perfect frenzy.\n“And he only wanted to marry me, because I’d inherited a fortune,\nbecause of that, because of that! I always suspected it was because of\nthat! Oh, he is a brute! He was always convinced that I should be\ntrembling with shame all my life before him, because I went to him\nthen, and that he had a right to despise me for ever for it, and so to\nbe superior to me—that’s why he wanted to marry me! That’s so, that’s\nall so! I tried to conquer him by my love—a love that knew no bounds. I\neven tried to forgive his faithlessness; but he understood nothing,\nnothing! How could he understand indeed? He is a monster! I only\nreceived that letter the next evening: it was brought me from the\ntavern—and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to forgive him\neverything, everything—even his treachery!”\n\nThe President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her. I can’t\nhelp thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her\nhysteria and of listening to such avowals. I remember hearing them say\nto her, “We understand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to\nfeel for you,” and so on, and so on. And yet they dragged the evidence\nout of the raving, hysterical woman. She described at last with\nextraordinary clearness, which is so often seen, though only for a\nmoment, in such over‐wrought states, how Ivan had been nearly driven\nout of his mind during the last two months trying to save “the monster\nand murderer,” his brother.",
            "8": "“He tortured himself,” she exclaimed, “he was always trying to minimize\nhis brother’s guilt and confessing to me that he, too, had never loved\nhis father, and perhaps desired his death himself. Oh, he has a tender,\nover‐ tender conscience! He tormented himself with his conscience! He\ntold me everything, everything! He came every day and talked to me as\nhis only friend. I have the honor to be his only friend!” she cried\nsuddenly with a sort of defiance, and her eyes flashed. “He had been\ntwice to see Smerdyakov. One day he came to me and said, ‘If it was not\nmy brother, but Smerdyakov committed the murder’ (for the legend was\ncirculating everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it), ‘perhaps I too am\nguilty, for Smerdyakov knew I didn’t like my father and perhaps\nbelieved that I desired my father’s death.’ Then I brought out that\nletter and showed it him. He was entirely convinced that his brother\nhad done it, and he was overwhelmed by it. He couldn’t endure the\nthought that his own brother was a parricide! Only a week ago I saw\nthat it was making him ill. During the last few days he has talked\nincoherently in my presence. I saw his mind was giving way. He walked\nabout, raving; he was seen muttering in the streets. The doctor from\nMoscow, at my request, examined him the day before yesterday and told\nme that he was on the eve of brain fever—and all on his account, on\naccount of this monster! And last night he learnt that Smerdyakov was\ndead! It was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind ... and all\nthrough this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!”",
            "9": "Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once\nin a lifetime—at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the\nscaffold! But it was in Katya’s character, and it was such a moment in\nher life. It was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the\nmercy of a young profligate to save her father; the same Katya who had\njust before, in her pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her\nmaidenly modesty before all these people, telling of Mitya’s generous\nconduct, in the hope of softening his fate a little. And now, again,\nshe sacrificed herself; but this time it was for another, and perhaps\nonly now—perhaps only at this moment—she felt and knew how dear that\nother was to her! She had sacrificed herself in terror for him,\nconceiving all of a sudden that he had ruined himself by his confession\nthat it was he who had committed the murder, not his brother, she had\nsacrificed herself to save him, to save his good name, his reputation!\n\nAnd yet one terrible doubt occurred to one—was she lying in her\ndescription of her former relations with Mitya?—that was the question.\nNo, she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that Mitya\ndespised her for her bowing down to him! She believed it herself. She\nhad been firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the\nsimple‐hearted Mitya, who even then adored her, was laughing at her and\ndespising her. She had loved him with an hysterical, “lacerated” love\nonly from pride, from wounded pride, and that love was not like love,\nbut more like revenge. Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown\ninto real love, perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but\nMitya’s faithlessness had wounded her to the bottom of her heart, and\nher heart could not forgive him. The moment of revenge had come upon\nher suddenly, and all that had been accumulating so long and so\npainfully in the offended woman’s breast burst out all at once and\nunexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed herself, too. And no\nsooner had she given full expression to her feelings than the tension\nof course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame. Hysterics began\nagain: she fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming. She was carried\nout. At that moment Grushenka, with a wail, rushed towards Mitya before\nthey had time to prevent her.",
            "10": "“Mitya,” she wailed, “your serpent has destroyed you! There, she has\nshown you what she is!” she shouted to the judges, shaking with anger.\nAt a signal from the President they seized her and tried to remove her\nfrom the court. She wouldn’t allow it. She fought and struggled to get\nback to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her. He was\noverpowered.\n\nYes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been\nsatisfied—the show had been a varied one. Then I remember the Moscow\ndoctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously\nsent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan. The doctor\nannounced to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous\nattack of brain fever, and that he must be at once removed. In answer\nto questions from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he\nsaid that the patient had come to him of his own accord the day before\nyesterday and that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming\non, but he had not consented to be looked after. “He was certainly not\nin a normal state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when\nhe was awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead,\nand that Satan visited him every evening,” said the doctor, in\nconclusion. Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew.\nThe letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material\nproofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to proceed with the\ntrial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence (given by\nIvan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol.\n\nBut I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only\nrepeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their\ncharacteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the\nprosecutor’s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was\nexcited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all\nwere awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with\nintense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina\nIvanovna’s evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the\nevidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I\nbelieve it was just eight o’clock when the President returned to his\nseat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech."

            "0": "Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with\ncold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns. He\ndescribed this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his\n_chef‐d’œuvre_, the _chef‐d’œuvre_ of his whole life, as his swan‐song.\nHe died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he\nhad the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing\nhis last song. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into\nthat speech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that\nat least some feeling for the public welfare and “the eternal question”\nlay concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its\nsincerity. He genuinely believed in the prisoner’s guilt; he was\naccusing him not as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance\nhe quivered with a genuine passion “for the security of society.” Even\nthe ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit\nKirillovitch, admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on\nthem. He began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and\nfilled the court to the end of his speech. But as soon as he had\nfinished, he almost fainted.",
            "1": "“Gentlemen of the jury,” began the prosecutor, “this case has made a\nstir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there\nso peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such\ncrimes! That’s what’s so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to\nhorrify us. What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to\nit, and not this or that isolated crime. What are the causes of our\nindifference, our lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the\ntimes, ominous of an unenviable future? Is it our cynicism, is it the\npremature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is\nsinking into decay, in spite of its youth? Is it that our moral\nprinciples are shattered to their foundations, or is it, perhaps, a\ncomplete lack of such principles among us? I cannot answer such\nquestions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and every citizen not only\nmust, but ought to be harassed by them. Our newborn and still timid\npress has done good service to the public already, for without it we\nshould never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral\ndegradation which are continually made known by the press, not merely\nto those who attend the new jury courts established in the present\nreign, but to every one. And what do we read almost daily? Of things\nbeside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace.\nBut what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes\nof violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us\nthat it is difficult to contend against it.",
            "2": "“One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very\noutset of his career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of\nconscience, murdering an official who had once been his benefactor, and\nthe servant girl, to steal his own I.O.U. and what ready money he could\nfind on him; ‘it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable\nworld and for my career in the future.’ After murdering them, he puts\npillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a\nyoung hero ‘decorated for bravery’ kills the mother of his chief and\nbenefactor, like a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him\nhe asserts that ‘she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his\ndirections and take no precautions.’ Granted that he is a monster, yet\nI dare not say in these days that he is unique. Another man will not\ncommit the murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as\ndishonorable in soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he asks\nhimself perhaps, ‘What is honor, and isn’t the condemnation of\nbloodshed a prejudice?’\n\n“Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical,\nthat it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say\nso—and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh,\ndon’t believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only\na tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true—even so it’s\nawful! Look how our young people commit suicide, without asking\nthemselves Hamlet’s question what there is beyond, without a sign of\nsuch a question, as though all that relates to the soul and to what\nawaits us beyond the grave had long been erased in their minds and\nburied under the sands. Look at our vice, at our profligates. Fyodor\nPavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present case, was almost an\ninnocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we all knew him, ‘he\nlived among us!’...",
            "3": "“Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe\nwill study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth\nit. But this study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic\ntopsy‐turvydom of to‐day is farther behind us, so that it’s possible to\nexamine it with more insight and more impartiality than I can do. Now\nwe are either horrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really\ngloat over the spectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations\nwhich tickle our cynical, pampered idleness. Or, like little children,\nwe brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so\nas to return to our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished.\nBut we must one day begin life in sober earnest, we must look at\nourselves as a society; it’s time we tried to grasp something of our\nsocial position, or at least to make a beginning in that direction.\n\n“A great writer[9] of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift\ntroika galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, ‘Oh, troika, birdlike\ntroika, who invented thee!’ and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the\npeoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the\nrecklessly galloping troika to pass. That may be, they may stand aside,\nrespectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his\nbook in this way either in an access of childish and naïve optimism, or\nsimply in fear of the censorship of the day. For if the troika were\ndrawn by his heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach\nno rational goal, whoever might be driving it. And those were the\nheroes of an older generation, ours are worse specimens still....”\n\nAt this point Ippolit Kirillovitch’s speech was interrupted by\napplause. The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. The\napplause was, it’s true, of brief duration, so that the President did\nnot think it necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely\nin the direction of the offenders. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was\nencouraged; he had never been applauded before! He had been all his\nlife unable to get a hearing, and now he suddenly had an opportunity of\nsecuring the ear of all Russia.",
            "4": "“What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an\nunenviable notoriety throughout Russia?” he continued. “Perhaps I am\nexaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of\nthe educated class of to‐day are reflected in this family picture—only,\nof course, in miniature, ‘like the sun in a drop of water.’ Think of\nthat unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a\nmelancholy end, the head of a family! Beginning life of noble birth,\nbut in a poor dependent position, through an unexpected marriage he\ncame into a small fortune. A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of\nfairly good, though undeveloped, intelligence, he was, above all, a\nmoneylender, who grew bolder with growing prosperity. His abject and\nservile characteristics disappeared, his malicious and sarcastic\ncynicism was all that remained. On the spiritual side he was\nundeveloped, while his vitality was excessive. He saw nothing in life\nbut sensual pleasure, and he brought his children up to be the same. He\nhad no feelings for his duties as a father. He ridiculed those duties.\nHe left his little children to the servants, and was glad to be rid of\nthem, forgot about them completely. The old man’s maxim was _Après moi\nle déluge_. He was an example of everything that is opposed to civic\nduty, of the most complete and malignant individualism. ‘The world may\nburn for aught I care, so long as I am all right,’ and he was all\nright; he was content, he was eager to go on living in the same way for\nanother twenty or thirty years. He swindled his own son and spent his\nmoney, his maternal inheritance, on trying to get his mistress from\nhim. No, I don’t intend to leave the prisoner’s defense altogether to\nmy talented colleague from Petersburg. I will speak the truth myself, I\ncan well understand what resentment he had heaped up in his son’s heart\nagainst him.\n\n“But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he has paid the penalty.\nLet us remember, however, that he was a father, and one of the typical\nfathers of to‐day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he is typical of\nmany modern fathers? Alas! many of them only differ in not openly\nprofessing such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured,\nbut their philosophy is essentially the same as his. Perhaps I am a\npessimist, but you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand,\nyou need not believe me, but let me speak. Let me say what I have to\nsay, and remember something of my words.",
            "5": "“Now for the children of this father, this head of a family. One of\nthem is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal\nwith him. Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.\n\n“The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and\nvigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything. He has denied\nand rejected much already, like his father. We have all heard him, he\nwas a welcome guest in local society. He never concealed his opinions,\nquite the contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather\nopenly of him now, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of\nthe Karamazov family. Another personage closely connected with the case\ndied here by his own hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot,\nformerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor\nPavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the preliminary inquiry, he told me with\nhysterical tears how the young Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his\nspiritual audacity. ‘Everything in the world is lawful according to\nhim, and nothing must be forbidden in the future—that is what he always\ntaught me.’ I believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this\ntheory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks from which he\nsuffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his\nfaculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation, which would\nhave done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed,\nwhy I’ve mentioned it: ‘If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor\nPavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.’\n\n“With that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it\nindelicate to continue further. Oh, I don’t want to draw any further\nconclusions and croak like a raven over the young man’s future. We’ve\nseen to‐day in this court that there are still good impulses in his\nyoung heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack\nof faith and cynicism, which have come to him rather by inheritance\nthan by the exercise of independent thought.",
            "6": "“Then the third son. Oh, he is a devout and modest youth, who does not\nshare his elder brother’s gloomy and destructive theory of life. He has\nsought to cling to the ‘ideas of the people,’ or to what goes by that\nname in some circles of our intellectual classes. He clung to the\nmonastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to\nhave betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which\nleads so many in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its\ncorrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to\nEuropean enlightenment, to return to their ‘native soil,’ as they say,\nto the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened\nchildren, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their\ndecrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the\nhorrors that terrify them.\n\n“For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I\ntrust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the\npeople may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into\ngloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism—two\nelements which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature\ndecay, due to misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European\nideas, from which his elder brother is suffering.”\n\nTwo or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism\nand mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by\nhis own eloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to\nsay nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and\nconsumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in\nhis life. People said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy\nmotives in his criticism of Ivan, because the latter had on one or two\noccasions got the better of him in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch,\nremembering it, tried now to take his revenge. But I don’t know whether\nit was true. All this was only introductory, however, and the speech\npassed to more direct consideration of the case.",
            "7": "“But to return to the eldest son,” Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. “He is\nthe prisoner before us. We have his life and his actions, too, before\nus; the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface.\nWhile his brothers seem to stand for ‘Europeanism’ and ‘the principles\nof the people,’ he seems to represent Russia as she is. Oh, not all\nRussia, not all! God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her,\nour mother Russia, the very scent and sound of her. Oh, he is\nspontaneous, he is a marvelous mingling of good and evil, he is a lover\nof culture and Schiller, yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the\nbeards of his boon companions. Oh, he, too, can be good and noble, but\nonly when all goes well with him. What is more, he can be carried off\nhis feet, positively carried off his feet by noble ideals, but only if\nthey come of themselves, if they fall from heaven for him, if they need\nnot be paid for. He dislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of\nreceiving, and that’s so with him in everything. Oh, give him every\npossible good in life (he couldn’t be content with less), and put no\nobstacle in his way, and he will show that he, too, can be noble. He is\nnot greedy, no, but he must have money, a great deal of money, and you\nwill see how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling\nit all away in the reckless dissipation of one night. But if he has not\nmoney, he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in\ngreat need of it. But all this later, let us take events in their\nchronological order.\n\n“First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the\nback‐ yard ‘without boots on his feet,’ as our worthy and esteemed\nfellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I\nrepeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am\nhere to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I,\ntoo, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character.\nBut the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and other\nreckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of\nRussia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of course, he\nneeded money, money before all things, and so after prolonged disputes\nhe came to a settlement with his father, and the last six thousand was\nsent him. A letter is in existence in which he practically gives up his\nclaim to the rest and settles his conflict with his father over the\ninheritance on the payment of this six thousand.",
            "8": "“Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and\nbrilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you\nhave only just heard them. Honor, self‐sacrifice were shown there, and\nI will be silent. The figure of the young officer, frivolous and\nprofligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown\nin a very sympathetic light before us. But the other side of the medal\nwas unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very court.\nAgain I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so, but there\nwere causes. The same lady, bathed in tears of long‐concealed\nindignation, alleged that he, he of all men, had despised her for her\naction, which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still dictated\nby lofty and generous motives. He, he, the girl’s betrothed, looked at\nher with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable from him\nthan from any one. And knowing that he had already deceived her (he had\ndeceived her, believing that she was bound to endure everything from\nhim, even treachery), she intentionally offered him three thousand\nroubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him understand that she was\noffering him money to deceive her. ‘Well, will you take it or not, are\nyou so lost to shame?’ was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes.\nHe looked at her, saw clearly what was in her mind (he’s admitted here\nbefore you that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand\nunconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of\nhis affections.",
            "9": "“What are we to believe then? The first legend of the young officer\nsacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and\ndoing reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture? As a rule,\nbetween two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case\nthis is not true. The probability is that in the first case he was\ngenuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base. And why? Because\nhe was of the broad Karamazov character—that’s just what I am leading\nup to—capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions, and\ncapable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths. Remember\nthe brilliant remark made by a young observer who has seen the\nKaramazov family at close quarters—Mr. Rakitin: ‘The sense of their own\ndegradation is as essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the\nsense of their lofty generosity.’ And that’s true, they need\ncontinually this unnatural mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or\nthey are miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete.\nThey are wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and put\nup with everything.\n\n“By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we’ve just touched upon that three\nthousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little. Can\nyou conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a\nway, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation,\ncould have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum,\nthat very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the\nfirmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month\nafterwards, in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it!\nNeither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he was flying into\nthe country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential\nto him to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his\nfather, did he bring himself to touch that little bag! Why, if only to\navoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous,\nhe would have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed\nat home to keep watch over her, and to await the moment when she would\nsay to him at last ‘I am yours,’ and to fly with her far from their\nfatal surroundings.",
            "10": "“But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason he gives\nfor it? The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she would\nsay, ‘I am yours, take me where you will,’ he might have the\nwherewithal to take her. But that first reason, in the prisoner’s own\nwords, was of little weight beside the second. While I have that money\non me, he said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to\nmy insulted betrothed, and, laying down half the sum I have\nfraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her, ‘You see, I’ve\nsquandered half your money, and shown I am a weak and immoral man, and,\nif you like, a scoundrel’ (I use the prisoner’s own expressions), ‘but\nthough I am a scoundrel, I am not a thief, for if I had been a thief, I\nshouldn’t have brought you back this half of the money, but should have\ntaken it as I did the other half!’ A marvelous explanation! This\nfrantic, but weak man, who could not resist the temptation of accepting\nthe three thousand roubles at the price of such disgrace, this very man\nsuddenly develops the most stoical firmness, and carries about a\nthousand roubles without daring to touch it. Does that fit in at all\nwith the character we have analyzed? No, and I venture to tell you how\nthe real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances, if\nhe really had brought himself to put away the money.\n\n“At the first temptation—for instance, to entertain the woman with whom\nhe had already squandered half the money—he would have unpicked his\nlittle bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he\nhave taken back precisely half the money, that is, fifteen hundred\nroubles? why not fourteen hundred? He could just as well have said then\nthat he was not a thief, because he brought back fourteen hundred\nroubles. Then another time he would have unpicked it again and taken\nout another hundred, and then a third, and then a fourth, and before\nthe end of the month he would have taken the last note but one, feeling\nthat if he took back only a hundred it would answer the purpose, for a\nthief would have stolen it all. And then he would have looked at this\nlast note, and have said to himself, ‘It’s really not worth while to\ngive back one hundred; let’s spend that, too!’ That’s how the real\nDmitri Karamazov, as we know him, would have behaved. One cannot\nimagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend\nof the little bag. Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we shall\nreturn to that later.”",
            "11": "After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the\nfinancial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that\nit was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was\nin the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the\nmedical experts in reference to Mitya’s fixed idea about the three\nthousand owing him."

As for his being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only\nin one point, that is, his fixed idea about the three thousand. Yet I\nthink one might find a much simpler cause than his tendency to\ninsanity. For my part I agree thoroughly with the young doctor who\nmaintained that the prisoner’s mental faculties have always been\nnormal, and that he has only been irritable and exasperated. The object\nof the prisoner’s continual and violent anger was not the sum itself;\nthere was a special motive at the bottom of it. That motive is\njealousy!”\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner’s fatal\npassion for Grushenka. He began from the moment when the prisoner went\nto the “young person’s” lodgings “to beat her”—“I use his own\nexpression,” the prosecutor explained—“but instead of beating her, he\nremained there, at her feet. That was the beginning of the passion. At\nthe same time the prisoner’s father was captivated by the same young\nperson—a strange and fatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts\nto her simultaneously, though both had known her before. And she\ninspired in both of them the most violent, characteristically Karamazov\npassion. We have her own confession: ‘I was laughing at both of them.’\nYes, the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her, and she\nconquered both of them at once. The old man, who worshiped money, at\nonce set aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from\nher, but soon after that, he would have been happy to lay his property\nand his name at her feet, if only she would become his lawful wife. We\nhave good evidence of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of his\nfate is evident; it is before us. But such was the young person’s\n‘game.’ The enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope until the\nlast moment, when he knelt before her, stretching out hands that were\nalready stained with the blood of his father and rival. It was in that\nposition that he was arrested. ‘Send me to Siberia with him, I have\nbrought him to this, I am most to blame,’ the woman herself cried, in\ngenuine remorse at the moment of his arrest.",
            "1": "“The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin,\ncharacterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: ‘She was\ndisillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who\nseduced and abandoned her. She was left in poverty, cursed by her\nrespectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old\nman, whom she still, however, considers as her benefactor. There was\nperhaps much that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered\ntoo early. She became prudent and saved money. She grew sarcastic and\nresentful against society.’ After this sketch of her character it may\nwell be understood that she might laugh at both of them simply from\nmischief, from malice.\n\n“After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he\nbetrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor,\nthe prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by\ncontinual jealousy—and of whom? His father! And the worst of it was\nthat the crazy old man was alluring and enticing the object of his\naffection by means of that very three thousand roubles, which the son\nlooked upon as his own property, part of his inheritance from his\nmother, of which his father was cheating him. Yes, I admit it was hard\nto bear! It might well drive a man to madness. It was not the money,\nbut the fact that this money was used with such revolting cynicism to\nruin his happiness!”\n\nThen the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his\nfather had entered the prisoner’s head, and illustrated his theory with\nfacts.\n\n“At first he only talked about it in taverns—he was talking about it\nall that month. Ah, he likes being always surrounded with company, and\nhe likes to tell his companions everything, even his most diabolical\nand dangerous ideas; he likes to share every thought with others, and\nexpects, for some reason, that those he confides in will meet him with\nperfect sympathy, enter into all his troubles and anxieties, take his\npart and not oppose him in anything. If not, he flies into a rage and\nsmashes up everything in the tavern. [Then followed the anecdote about\nCaptain Snegiryov.] Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last\nthat he might mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn\nthreats into actions.”",
            "2": "Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the\nmonastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of\nviolence when the prisoner had rushed into his father’s house just\nafter dinner.\n\n“I cannot positively assert,” the prosecutor continued, “that the\nprisoner fully intended to murder his father before that incident. Yet\nthe idea had several times presented itself to him, and he had\ndeliberated on it—for that we have facts, witnesses, and his own words.\nI confess, gentlemen of the jury,” he added, “that till to‐day I have\nbeen uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious\npremeditation. I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the fatal\nmoment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating it as a\npossibility. He had not definitely considered when and how he might\ncommit the crime.\n\n“But I was only uncertain till to‐day, till that fatal document was\npresented to the court just now. You yourselves heard that young lady’s\nexclamation, ‘It is the plan, the program of the murder!’ That is how\nshe defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner.\nAnd, in fact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder\nwas premeditated. It was written two days before, and so we know now\nfor a fact that, forty‐eight hours before the perpetration of his\nterrible design, the prisoner swore that, if he could not get money\nnext day, he would murder his father in order to take the envelope with\nthe notes from under his pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. ‘As soon as\nIvan had gone away’—you hear that; so he had thought everything out,\nweighing every circumstance, and he carried it all out just as he had\nwritten it. The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must\nhave been committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly,\nthat is written and signed. The prisoner does not deny his signature.",
            "3": "“I shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it. But that does not\ndiminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he wrote when\ndrunk what he had planned when sober. Had he not planned it when sober,\nhe would not have written it when drunk. I shall be asked: Then why did\nhe talk about it in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is\nsilent and keeps it to himself. Yes, but he talked about it before he\nhad formed a plan, when he had only the desire, only the impulse to it.\nAfterwards he talked less about it. On the evening he wrote that letter\nat the ‘Metropolis’ tavern, contrary to his custom he was silent,\nthough he had been drinking. He did not play billiards, he sat in a\ncorner, talked to no one. He did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat,\nbut that was done almost unconsciously, because he could never enter a\ntavern without making a disturbance. It is true that after he had taken\nthe final decision, he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked\ntoo much about his design beforehand, and that this might lead to his\narrest and prosecution afterwards. But there was nothing for it; he\ncould not take his words back, but his luck had served him before, it\nwould serve him again. He believed in his star, you know! I must\nconfess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe.\n‘To‐morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,’ as he\nwrites in his peculiar language, ‘and if they won’t give it to me,\nthere will be bloodshed.’ ”",
            "4": "Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all\nMitya’s efforts to borrow the money. He described his visit to\nSamsonov, his journey to Lyagavy. “Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after\nselling his watch to pay for the journey (though he tells us he had\nfifteen hundred roubles on him—a likely story), tortured by jealousy at\nhaving left the object of his affections in the town, suspecting that\nshe would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his absence, he returned at last\nto the town, to find, to his joy, that she had not been near his\nfather. He accompanied her himself to her protector. (Strange to say,\nhe doesn’t seem to have been jealous of Samsonov, which is\npsychologically interesting.) Then he hastens back to his ambush in the\nback gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a fit, that the\nother servant is ill—the coast is clear and he knows the ‘signals’—what\na temptation! Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady who has for\nsome time been residing in the town, and who is highly esteemed among\nus, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his career with\ncompassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his\ndissipated life, his unseemly love‐affair, the waste of his youth and\nvigor in pot‐house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the gold‐\nmines: ‘that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your\nromantic character, your thirst for adventure.’ ”\n\nAfter describing the result of this conversation and the moment when\nthe prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov’s, the\nsudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous\nexhaustion, at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with\nhis father, Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal\ninfluence of chance. “Had the maid told him that her mistress was at\nMokroe with her former lover, nothing would have happened. But she lost\nher head, she could only swear and protest her ignorance, and if the\nprisoner did not kill her on the spot, it was only because he flew in\npursuit of his false mistress.",
            "5": "“But note, frantic as he was, he took with him a brass pestle. Why\nthat? Why not some other weapon? But since he had been contemplating\nhis plan and preparing himself for it for a whole month, he would\nsnatch up anything like a weapon that caught his eye. He had realized\nfor a month past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon,\nso he instantly, without hesitation, recognized that it would serve his\npurpose. So it was by no means unconsciously, by no means\ninvoluntarily, that he snatched up that fatal pestle. And then we find\nhim in his father’s garden—the coast is clear, there are no witnesses,\ndarkness and jealousy. The suspicion that she was there, with him, with\nhis rival, in his arms, and perhaps laughing at him at that moment—took\nhis breath away. And it was not mere suspicion, the deception was open,\nobvious. She must be there, in that lighted room, she must be behind\nthe screen; and the unhappy man would have us believe that he stole up\nto the window, peeped respectfully in, and discreetly withdrew, for\nfear something terrible and immoral should happen. And he tries to\npersuade us of that, us, who understand his character, who know his\nstate of mind at the moment, and that he knew the signals by which he\ncould at once enter the house.” At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch\nbroke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of\nSmerdyakov with the murder. He did this very circumstantially, and\nevery one realized that, although he professed to despise that\nsuspicion, he thought the subject of great importance."

        "content": {
            "0": "“To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?” (Ippolit\nKirillovitch began.) “The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov\nhad committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his\narrest, yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single\nfact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The\ncharge is confirmed by three persons only—the two brothers of the\nprisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his\nsuspicions only to‐day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain\nfever. But we know that for the last two months he has completely\nshared our conviction of his brother’s guilt and did not attempt to\ncombat that idea. But of that later. The younger brother has admitted\nthat he has not the slightest fact to support his notion of\nSmerdyakov’s guilt, and has only been led to that conclusion from the\nprisoner’s own words and the expression of his face. Yes, that\nastounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to‐ day by\nhim. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. ‘What the prisoner tells\nyou, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.’ That is all the\nevidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are\nall deeply concerned in the prisoner’s fate. And yet the theory of\nSmerdyakov’s guilt has been noised about, has been and is still\nmaintained. Is it credible? Is it conceivable?”\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the\npersonality of Smerdyakov, “who had cut short his life in a fit of\ninsanity.” He depicted him as a man of weak intellect, with a\nsmattering of education, who had been thrown off his balance by\nphilosophical ideas above his level and certain modern theories of\nduty, which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his master,\nwho was also perhaps his father—Fyodor Pavlovitch; and, theoretically,\nfrom various strange philosophical conversations with his master’s\nelder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily indulged in this diversion,\nprobably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet’s\nexpense. “He spoke to me himself of his spiritual condition during the\nlast few days at his father’s house,” Ippolit Kirillovitch explained;\n“but others too have borne witness to it—the prisoner himself, his\nbrother, and the servant Grigory—that is, all who knew him well.",
            "1": "“Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his attacks of\nepilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. ‘He fell at my feet and\nkissed them,’ the prisoner himself has told us, before he realized how\ndamaging such a statement was to himself. ‘He is an epileptic chicken,’\nhe declared about him in his characteristic language. And the prisoner\nchose him for his confidant (we have his own word for it) and he\nfrightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy for him. In that\ncapacity he deceived his master, revealing to the prisoner the\nexistence of the envelope with the notes in it and the signals by means\nof which he could get into the house. How could he help telling him,\nindeed? ‘He would have killed me, I could see that he would have killed\nme,’ he said at the inquiry, trembling and shaking even before us,\nthough his tormentor was by that time arrested and could do him no\nharm. ‘He suspected me at every instant. In fear and trembling I\nhastened to tell him every secret to pacify him, that he might see that\nI had not deceived him and let me off alive.’ Those are his own words.\nI wrote them down and I remember them. ‘When he began shouting at me, I\nwould fall on my knees.’\n\n“He was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of\nhis master, ever since he had restored him some money he had lost. So\nit may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at\nhaving deceived his master, whom he loved as his benefactor. Persons\nseverely afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell\nus, always prone to continual and morbid self‐reproach. They worry over\ntheir ‘wickedness,’ they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often\nentirely without cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of\nfaults and crimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really\nbeen driven to wrong‐doing by terror and intimidation.\n\n“He had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would\nbe the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eyes.\nWhen Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the\ncatastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid\nto tell him plainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but\nhis hints were not understood.",
            "2": "“It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a\nprotector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm\nwould come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov’s drunken\nletter, ‘I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.’ So Ivan\nFyodorovitch’s presence seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and\norder in the house.\n\n“But he went away, and within an hour of his young master’s departure\nSmerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit. But that’s perfectly\nintelligible. Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror\nand despair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of\nthe fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain, might\nbe coming upon him again. The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of\ncourse, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is\nlikely to have one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan\nFyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his\nlonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar. He went down the\nstairs wondering if he would have a fit or not, and what if it were to\ncome upon him at once. And that very apprehension, that very wonder,\nbrought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks,\nand he fell unconscious into the cellar. And in this perfectly natural\noccurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he was\nshamming an attack _on purpose_. But, if it were on purpose, the\nquestion arises at once, what was his motive? What was he reckoning on?\nWhat was he aiming at? I say nothing about medicine: science, I am\ntold, may go astray: the doctors were not able to discriminate between\nthe counterfeit and the real. That may be so, but answer me one\nquestion: what motive had he for such a counterfeit? Could he, had he\nbeen plotting the murder, have desired to attract the attention of the\nhousehold by having a fit just before?",
            "3": "“You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were\nfive persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s—Fyodor Pavlovitch himself (but he\ndid not kill himself, that’s evident); then his servant, Grigory, but\nhe was almost killed himself; the third person was Grigory’s wife,\nMarfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her\nmurdering her master. Two persons are left—the prisoner and Smerdyakov.\nBut, if we are to believe the prisoner’s statement that he is not the\nmurderer, then Smerdyakov must have been, for there is no other\nalternative, no one else can be found. That is what accounts for the\nartful, astounding accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed\nsuicide yesterday. Had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else,\nhad there been any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner\nwould have been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have accused\nthat sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is\nperfectly absurd.\n\n“Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let\nus even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the\nfacts tell us. If Smerdyakov killed him, how did he do it? Alone or\nwith the assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first\nalternative—that he did it alone. If he had killed him it must have\nbeen with some object, for some advantage to himself. But not having a\nshadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder—hatred,\njealousy, and so on—Smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the\nsake of gain, in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had\nseen his master put in the envelope. And yet he tells another\nperson—and a person most closely interested, that is, the\nprisoner—everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope\nlay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all,\ntold him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do\nthis simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one\nwho would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? ‘Yes,’ I shall\nbe told, ‘but he betrayed it from fear.’ But how do you explain this? A\nman who could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out,\ntells facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if\nhe held his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!",
            "4": "“No, however cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime,\nnothing would have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and\nthe signals, for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand. He\nwould have invented something, he would have told some lie if he had\nbeen forced to give information, but he would have been silent about\nthat. For, on the other hand, if he had said nothing about the money,\nbut had committed the murder and stolen the money, no one in the world\ncould have charged him with murder for the sake of robbery, since no\none but he had seen the money, no one but he knew of its existence in\nthe house. Even if he had been accused of the murder, it could only\nhave been thought that he had committed it from some other motive. But\nsince no one had observed any such motive in him beforehand, and every\none saw, on the contrary, that his master was fond of him and honored\nhim with his confidence, he would, of course, have been the last to be\nsuspected. People would have suspected first the man who had a motive,\na man who had himself declared he had such motives, who had made no\nsecret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the son of the\nmurdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Had Smerdyakov killed and robbed\nhim, and the son been accused of it, that would, of course, have suited\nSmerdyakov. Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the murder, he\ntold that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the signals?\nIs that logical? Is that clear?",
            "5": "“When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him\nfalling downstairs in a _feigned_ fit—with what object? In the first\nplace that Grigory, who had been intending to take his medicine, might\nput it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after\nthe house, and, in the second place, I suppose, that his master seeing\nthat there was no one to guard him, and in terror of a visit from his\nson, might redouble his vigilance and precaution. And, most of all, I\nsuppose that he, Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from\nthe kitchen, where he always slept, apart from all the rest, and where\nhe could go in and out as he liked, to Grigory’s room at the other end\nof the lodge, where he was always put, shut off by a screen three paces\nfrom their own bed. This was the immemorial custom established by his\nmaster and the kind‐hearted Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he had a fit.\nThere, lying behind the screen, he would most likely, to keep up the\nsham, have begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night (as\nGrigory and his wife testified). And all this, we are to believe, that\nhe might more conveniently get up and murder his master!\n\n“But I shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might\nnot be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the\nsignals to tempt him to commit the murder, and when he had murdered him\nand had gone away with the money, making a noise, most likely, and\nwaking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in—what\nfor? To murder his master a second time and carry off the money that\nhad already been stolen? Gentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to\nput forward such suggestions, but, incredible as it seems, that’s just\nwhat the prisoner alleges. When he had left the house, had knocked\nGrigory down and raised an alarm, he tells us Smerdyakov got up, went\nin and murdered his master and stole the money! I won’t press the point\nthat Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have\nforeseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep\nin respectfully, though he knew the signals, and beat a retreat,\nleaving Smerdyakov his booty. Gentlemen of the jury, I put this\nquestion to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could\nhave committed his crime? Name that moment, or you can’t accuse him.",
            "6": "“But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered,\nheard a shout, and went out. Well—what then? He looked about him and\nsaid, ‘Why not go and kill the master?’ And how did he know what had\nhappened, since he had been lying unconscious till that moment? But\nthere’s a limit to these flights of fancy.\n\n“ ‘Quite so,’ some astute people will tell me, ‘but what if they were\nin agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the\nmoney—what then?’ A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm\nit are astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble\nwhile his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to\narouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his master and alarm in\nGrigory. It would be interesting to know what motives could have\ninduced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan.\n\n“But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov’s\npart, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was\nintimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that\nhe would be blamed for letting his master be murdered, without\nscreaming for help or resisting, he may have obtained permission from\nDmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit—‘you may\nmurder him as you like; it’s nothing to me.’ But as this attack of\nSmerdyakov’s was bound to throw the household into confusion, Dmitri\nKaramazov could never have agreed to such a plan. I will waive that\npoint however. Supposing that he did agree, it would still follow that\nDmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is\nonly a passive accomplice, and not even an accomplice, but merely\nacquiesced against his will through terror.",
            "7": "“But what do we see? As soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly\nthrows all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him of being his\naccomplice, but of being himself the murderer. ‘He did it alone,’ he\nsays. ‘He murdered and robbed him. It was the work of his hands.’\nStrange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once!\nAnd think of the risk for Karamazov. After committing the murder while\nhis accomplice lay in bed, he throws the blame on the invalid, who\nmight well have resented it and in self‐preservation might well have\nconfessed the truth. For he might well have seen that the court would\nat once judge how far he was responsible, and so he might well have\nreckoned that if he were punished, it would be far less severely than\nthe real murderer. But in that case he would have been certain to make\na confession, yet he has not done so. Smerdyakov never hinted at their\ncomplicity, though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and\ndeclaring that he had committed the crime alone.\n\n“What’s more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that\nit was _he_ who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of\nthe signals, and that, but for him, he would have known nothing about\nthem. If he had really been a guilty accomplice, would he so readily\nhave made this statement at the inquiry? On the contrary, he would have\ntried to conceal it, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he was\nfar from distorting or minimizing them. No one but an innocent man, who\nhad no fear of being charged with complicity, could have acted as he\ndid. And in a fit of melancholy arising from his disease and this\ncatastrophe he hanged himself yesterday. He left a note written in his\npeculiar language, ‘I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so\nas to throw no blame on any one.’ What would it have cost him to add:\n‘I am the murderer, not Karamazov’? But that he did not add. Did his\nconscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt?",
            "8": "“And what followed? Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into\nthe court just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay\nin the envelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had\nreceived them from Smerdyakov the day before. But I need not recall the\npainful scene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such\ntrivial ones as might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and\nso may be overlooked. In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given\nback the money and hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only\nyesterday he confessed his guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter\ninforms us. If it were not so, indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch\nhave kept silence till now? And so, if he has confessed, then why, I\nask again, did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left\nbehind, knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible\nordeal the next day?\n\n“The money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact\ncame to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court\nthat Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five\nthousand each—that is, ten thousand in all—to the chief town of the\nprovince to be changed. I only mention this to point out that any one\nmay have money, and that it can’t be proved that these notes are the\nsame as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch’s envelope.",
            "9": "“Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such\nimportance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn’t he report\nit at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a\nright to conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week\npast: he had admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that\nhe was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead:\nhe was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been\nstricken down to‐day. In this condition he suddenly heard of\nSmerdyakov’s death, and at once reflected, ‘The man is dead, I can\nthrow the blame on him and save my brother. I have money. I will take a\nroll of notes and say that Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.’\nYou will say that was dishonorable: it’s dishonorable to slander even\nthe dead, and even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered\nhim unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the\nvalet’s death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent scene:\nyou have seen the witness’s condition. He was standing up and was\nspeaking, but where was his mind?\n\n“Then followed the document, the prisoner’s letter written two days\nbefore the crime, and containing a complete program of the murder. Why,\nthen, are we looking for any other program? The crime was committed\nprecisely according to this program, and by no other than the writer of\nit. Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! He did not\nrun respectfully and timidly away from his father’s window, though he\nwas firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him.\nNo, that is absurd and unlikely! He went in and murdered him. Most\nlikely he killed him in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he\nlooked on his hated rival. But having killed him, probably with one\nblow of the brass pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful\nsearch, that she was not there, he did not, however, forget to put his\nhand under the pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of\nwhich lies now on the table before us.",
            "10": "“I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very\ncharacteristic circumstance. Had he been an experienced murderer and\nhad he committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he have\nleft the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse?\nHad it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his master to rob him,\nhe would have simply carried away the envelope with him, without\ntroubling himself to open it over his victim’s corpse, for he would\nhave known for certain that the notes were in the envelope—they had\nbeen put in and sealed up in his presence—and had he taken the envelope\nwith him, no one would ever have known of the robbery. I ask you,\ngentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved in that way? Would he have\nleft the envelope on the floor?\n\n“No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not\na thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes\nfrom under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though\nseizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it. For that was\nthe idea which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri\nKaramazov in regard to that money. And pouncing upon the envelope,\nwhich he had never seen before, he tore it open to make sure whether\nthe money was in it, and ran away with the money in his pocket, even\nforgetting to consider that he had left an astounding piece of evidence\nagainst himself in that torn envelope on the floor. All because it was\nKaramazov, not Smerdyakov, he didn’t think, he didn’t reflect, and how\nshould he? He ran away; he heard behind him the servant cry out; the\nold man caught him, stopped him and was felled to the ground by the\nbrass pestle.",
            "11": "“The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him. Would you\nbelieve it, he tells us that he leapt down out of pity, out of\ncompassion, to see whether he could do anything for him. Was that a\nmoment to show compassion? No; he jumped down simply to make certain\nwhether the only witness of his crime were dead or alive. Any other\nfeeling, any other motive would be unnatural. Note that he took trouble\nover Grigory, wiped his head with his handkerchief and, convincing\nhimself he was dead, he ran to the house of his mistress, dazed and\ncovered with blood. How was it he never thought that he was covered\nwith blood and would be at once detected? But the prisoner himself\nassures us that he did not even notice that he was covered with blood.\nThat may be believed, that is very possible, that always happens at\nsuch moments with criminals. On one point they will show diabolical\ncunning, while another will escape them altogether. But he was thinking\nat that moment of one thing only—where was _she_? He wanted to find out\nat once where she was, so he ran to her lodging and learnt an\nunexpected and astounding piece of news—she had gone off to Mokroe to\nmeet her first lover.”"

            "0": "Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition,\nbeloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on\ntheir own eager rhetoric. At this moment in his speech he went off into\na dissertation on Grushenka’s “first lover,” and brought forward\nseveral interesting thoughts on this theme.\n\n“Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed,\nso to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover. What\nmakes it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought\nof this formidable rival. But he had looked upon him as a remote\ndanger, and Karamazov always lives in the present. Possibly he regarded\nhim as a fiction. But his wounded heart grasped instantly that the\nwoman had been concealing this new rival and deceiving him, because he\nwas anything but a fiction to her, because he was the one hope of her\nlife. Grasping this instantly, he resigned himself.\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait\nin the prisoner’s character. He suddenly evinces an irresistible desire\nfor justice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to\nlove. And all this at the very moment when he had stained his hands\nwith his father’s blood for her sake! It is true that the blood he had\nshed was already crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his\nsoul and his life in this world, he was forced to ask himself at that\nsame instant what he was and what he could be now to her, to that\nbeing, dearer to him than his own soul, in comparison with that former\nlover who had returned penitent, with new love, to the woman he had\nonce betrayed, with honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed\nand happy life. And he, luckless man, what could he give her now, what\ncould he offer her?",
            "1": "“Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him by his\ncrime and that he was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with\nlife before him! This thought crushed him. And so he instantly flew to\none frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov’s character, must have\nappeared the one inevitable way out of his terrible position. That way\nout was suicide. He ran for the pistols he had left in pledge with his\nfriend Perhotin and on the way, as he ran, he pulled out of his pocket\nthe money, for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his\nfather’s gore. Oh, now he needed money more than ever. Karamazov would\ndie, Karamazov would shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be\nsure, he was a poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life.\n‘To her, to her! and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole\nworld, such as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of\nlong after! In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy\nsongs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I adore\nand her new‐found happiness! And then, on the spot, at her feet, I\nshall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She will\nremember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya loved her,\nshe will feel for Mitya!’\n\n“Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and\nsentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but\nthere is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries\nout in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart\nunto death—that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its\njudgment, its terrible torments! The pistol will settle everything, the\npistol is the only way out! But _beyond_—I don’t know whether Karamazov\nwondered at that moment ‘What lies beyond,’ and whether Karamazov\ncould, like Hamlet, wonder ‘What lies beyond.’ No, gentlemen of the\njury, they have their Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!”\n\nHere Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya’s\npreparations, the scene at Perhotin’s, at the shop, with the drivers.\nHe quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the\npicture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt of this\nharassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing, when the\nfacts were brought together.",
            "2": "“What need had he of precaution? Two or three times he almost\nconfessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.” (Then followed the\nevidence given by witnesses.) “He even cried out to the peasant who\ndrove him, ‘Do you know, you are driving a murderer!’ But it was\nimpossible for him to speak out, he had to get to Mokroe and there to\nfinish his romance. But what was awaiting the luckless man? Almost from\nthe first minute at Mokroe he saw that his invincible rival was perhaps\nby no means so invincible, that the toast to their new‐found happiness\nwas not desired and would not be acceptable. But you know the facts,\ngentlemen of the jury, from the preliminary inquiry. Karamazov’s\ntriumph over his rival was complete and his soul passed into quite a\nnew phase, perhaps the most terrible phase through which his soul has\npassed or will pass.\n\n“One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,” the prosecutor\ncontinued, “that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own\nvengeance more completely than any earthly justice. What’s more,\njustice and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of\nnature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such\nmoments, as its salvation from despair. For I cannot imagine the horror\nand moral suffering of Karamazov when he learnt that she loved him,\nthat for his sake she had rejected her first lover, that she was\nsummoning him, Mitya, to a new life, that she was promising him\nhappiness—and when? When everything was over for him and nothing was\npossible!\n\n“By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the\nlight it throws on the prisoner’s position at the moment. This woman,\nthis love of his, had been till the last moment, till the very instant\nof his arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him but\nunattainable. Yet why did he not shoot himself then, why did he\nrelinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was? It was just\nthat passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that\nrestrained him. Throughout their revels he kept close to his adored\nmistress, who was at the banquet with him and was more charming and\nfascinating to him than ever—he did not leave her side, abasing himself\nin his homage before her.",
            "3": "“His passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of\narrest, but even the torments of conscience. For a moment, oh, only for\na moment! I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly\nenslaved by these influences—first, the influence of drink, of noise\nand excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song,\nand of her, flushed with wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him!\nSecondly, the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be\nfar off, that not till next morning, at least, they would come and take\nhim. So he had a few hours and that’s much, very much! In a few hours\none can think of many things. I imagine that he felt something like\nwhat criminals feel when they are being taken to the scaffold. They\nhave another long, long street to pass down and at walking pace, past\nthousands of people. Then there will be a turning into another street\nand only at the end of that street the dread place of execution! I\nfancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man, sitting\non his shameful cart, must feel that he has infinite life still before\nhim. The houses recede, the cart moves on—oh, that’s nothing, it’s\nstill far to the turning into the second street and he still looks\nboldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious\npeople with their eyes fixed on him, and he still fancies that he is\njust such a man as they. But now the turning comes to the next street.\nOh, that’s nothing, nothing, there’s still a whole street before him,\nand however many houses have been passed, he will still think there are\nmany left. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.\n\n“This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. ‘They’ve not had\ntime yet,’ he must have thought, ‘I may still find some way out, oh,\nthere’s still time to make some plan of defense, and now, now—she is so\nfascinating!’",
            "4": "“His soul was full of confusion and dread, but he managed, however, to\nput aside half his money and hide it somewhere—I cannot otherwise\nexplain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had\njust taken from his father’s pillow. He had been in Mokroe more than\nonce before, he had caroused there for two days together already, he\nknew the old big house with all its passages and outbuildings. I\nimagine that part of the money was hidden in that house, not long\nbefore the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor, in some corner,\nunder the roof. With what object? I shall be asked. Why, the\ncatastrophe may take place at once, of course; he hadn’t yet considered\nhow to meet it, he hadn’t the time, his head was throbbing and his\nheart was with _her_, but money—money was indispensable in any case!\nWith money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at such a\nmoment may strike you as unnatural? But he assures us himself that a\nmonth before, at a critical and exciting moment, he had halved his\nmoney and sewn it up in a little bag. And though that was not true, as\nwe shall prove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to\nKaramazov, he had contemplated it. What’s more, when he declared at the\ninquiry that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag (which never\nexisted) he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of the\nmoment, because he had two hours before divided his money and hidden\nhalf of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply not to\nhave it on himself. Two extremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that\nKaramazov can contemplate two extremes and both at once.\n\n“We have looked in the house, but we haven’t found the money. It may\nstill be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the\nprisoner’s hands now. In any case he was at her side, on his knees\nbefore her, she was lying on the bed, he had his hands stretched out to\nher and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did not even\nhear the men coming to arrest him. He hadn’t time to prepare any line\nof defense in his mind. He was caught unawares and confronted with his\njudges, the arbiters of his destiny.",
            "5": "“Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our\nduties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his\naccount, too! The moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the\ncriminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means to\nstruggle, the moments when every instinct of self‐preservation rises up\nin him at once and he looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes,\nstudies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on which side you will\nstrike, and his distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an\ninstant, but he is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving himself\naway! This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for\nself‐preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are\nawful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even\nin the lawyer. And this was what we all witnessed then.\n\n“At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very\ncompromising phrases. ‘Blood! I’ve deserved it!’ But he quickly\nrestrained himself. He had not prepared what he was to say, what answer\nhe was to make, he had nothing but a bare denial ready. ‘I am not\nguilty of my father’s death.’ That was his fence for the moment and\nbehind it he hoped to throw up a barricade of some sort. His first\ncompromising exclamations he hastened to explain by declaring that he\nwas responsible for the death of the servant Grigory only. ‘Of that\nbloodshed I am guilty, but who has killed my father, gentlemen, who has\nkilled him? Who can have killed him, _if not I_?’ Do you hear, he asked\nus that, us, who had come to ask him that question! Do you hear that\nphrase uttered with such premature haste—‘if not I’—the animal cunning,\nthe naïveté, the Karamazov impatience of it? ‘I didn’t kill him and you\nmustn’t think I did! I wanted to kill him, gentlemen, I wanted to kill\nhim,’ he hastens to admit (he was in a hurry, in a terrible hurry),\n‘but still I am not guilty, it is not I murdered him.’ He concedes to\nus that he wanted to murder him, as though to say, you can see for\nyourselves how truthful I am, so you’ll believe all the sooner that I\ndidn’t murder him. Oh, in such cases the criminal is often amazingly\nshallow and credulous.",
            "6": "“At that point one of the lawyers asked him, as it were incidentally,\nthe most simple question, ‘Wasn’t it Smerdyakov killed him?’ Then, as\nwe expected, he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and\ncaught him unawares, before he had time to pave the way to choose and\nsnatch the moment when it would be most natural to bring in\nSmerdyakov’s name. He rushed at once to the other extreme, as he always\ndoes, and began to assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him,\nwas not capable of it. But don’t believe him, that was only his\ncunning; he didn’t really give up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the\ncontrary, he meant to bring him forward again; for, indeed, he had no\none else to bring forward, but he would do that later, because for the\nmoment that line was spoiled for him. He would bring him forward\nperhaps next day, or even a few days later, choosing an opportunity to\ncry out to us, ‘You know I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than\nyou, you remember that yourselves, but now I am convinced. He killed\nhim, he must have done!’ And for the present he falls back upon a\ngloomy and irritable denial. Impatience and anger prompted him,\nhowever, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked\ninto his father’s window and how he respectfully withdrew. The worst of\nit was that he was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence\ngiven by Grigory.",
            "7": "“We proceeded to search him. The search angered, but encouraged him,\nthe whole three thousand had not been found on him, only half of it.\nAnd no doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the\nlittle bag first occurred to him. No doubt he was conscious himself of\nthe improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound\nmore likely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible. In\nsuch cases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers,\nis to prevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him\nunexpectedly so that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their\nsimplicity, improbability and inconsistency. The criminal can only be\nmade to speak by the sudden and apparently incidental communication of\nsome new fact, of some circumstance of great importance in the case, of\nwhich he had no previous idea and could not have foreseen. We had such\na fact in readiness—that was Grigory’s evidence about the open door\nthrough which the prisoner had run out. He had completely forgotten\nabout that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen\nit.\n\n“The effect of it was amazing. He leapt up and shouted to us, ‘Then\nSmerdyakov murdered him, it was Smerdyakov!’ and so betrayed the basis\nof the defense he was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most\nimprobable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder\nafter he had knocked Grigory down and run away. When we told him that\nGrigory saw the door was open before he fell down, and had heard\nSmerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of his bedroom—Karamazov\nwas positively crushed. My esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay\nParfenovitch, told me afterwards that he was almost moved to tears at\nthe sight of him. And to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell\nus about the much‐talked‐of little bag—so be it, you shall hear this\nromance!",
            "8": "“Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this\nromance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that\ncould have been brought forward in the circumstances. If one tried for\na bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything\nmore incredible. The worst of such stories is that the triumphant\nromancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very\ndetails in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and\ninvoluntary story‐tellers neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they\nhave no thought to spare for such details, their minds are concentrated\non their grand invention as a whole, and fancy any one daring to pull\nthem up for a trifle! But that’s how they are caught. The prisoner was\nasked the question, ‘Where did you get the stuff for your little bag\nand who made it for you?’ ‘I made it myself.’ ‘And where did you get\nthe linen?’ The prisoner was positively offended, he thought it almost\ninsulting to ask him such a trivial question, and would you believe it,\nhis resentment was genuine! But they are all like that. ‘I tore it off\nmy shirt.’ ‘Then we shall find that shirt among your linen to‐morrow,\nwith a piece torn off.’ And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we\nreally had found that torn shirt (and how could we have failed to find\nit in his chest of drawers or trunk?) that would have been a fact, a\nmaterial fact in support of his statement! But he was incapable of that\nreflection. ‘I don’t remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I\nsewed it up in one of my landlady’s caps.’ ‘What sort of a cap?’ ‘It\nwas an old cotton rag of hers lying about.’ ‘And do you remember that\nclearly?’ ‘No, I don’t.’ And he was angry, very angry, and yet imagine\nnot remembering it! At the most terrible moments of man’s life, for\ninstance when he is being led to execution, he remembers just such\ntrifles. He will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed\npast him on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross—that he will remember. He\nconcealed the making of that little bag from his household, he must\nhave remembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and\nfind him needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he slipped behind\nthe screen (there is a screen in his lodgings).",
            "9": "“But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these\ndetails, trifles?” cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. “Just because\nthe prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. He has\nnot explained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he has\nnot added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic\nstatements; all those are trivialities. ‘You must believe it on my\nhonor.’ Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it, even\nif only on his word of honor! Are we jackals thirsting for human blood?\nShow us a single fact in the prisoner’s favor and we shall rejoice; but\nlet it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the\nprisoner’s expression by his own brother, or that when he beat himself\non the breast he must have meant to point to the little bag, in the\ndarkness, too. We shall rejoice at the new fact, we shall be the first\nto repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to repudiate it. But now\njustice cries out and we persist, we cannot repudiate anything.”\n\nIppolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as\nthough he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for\nvengeance, the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base\nmotive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of\nthe facts.",
            "10": "“And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for\nthe defense,” Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, “whatever\neloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities,\nremember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember\nthat you are the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy\nRussia, of her principles, her family, everything that she holds\nsacred! Yes, you represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict\nwill be heard not in this hall only but will reëcho throughout the\nwhole of Russia, and all Russia will hear you, as her champions and her\njudges, and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do\nnot disappoint Russia and her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on\nin her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for\nlong past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to\nits furious reckless course. And if other nations stand aside from that\ntroika that may be, not from respect, as the poet would fain believe,\nbut simply from horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it\nis that they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so\nand will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will\ncheck the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own\nsafety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard voices of\nalarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do\nnot heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of\na father by his son!”\n\nThough Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech\nwith this rhetorical appeal—and the effect produced by him was\nextraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly\nand, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room.\nThere was no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased.\nThe ladies were not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased\nwith his eloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the\nupshot of the trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch. “He will speak\nat last and of course carry all before him.”",
            "11": "Every one looked at Mitya; he sat silent through the whole of the\nprosecutor’s speech, clenching his teeth, with his hands clasped, and\nhis head bowed. Only from time to time he raised his head and listened,\nespecially when Grushenka was spoken of. When the prosecutor mentioned\nRakitin’s opinion of her, a smile of contempt and anger passed over his\nface and he murmured rather audibly, “The Bernards!” When Ippolit\nKirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at\nMokroe, Mitya raised his head and listened with intense curiosity. At\none point he seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled\nhimself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked\nafterwards of the end of the speech, of the prosecutor’s feat in\nexamining the prisoner at Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch.\n“The man could not resist boasting of his cleverness,” they said.\n\nThe court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an\nhour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and\nexclamations in the audience. I remember some of them.\n\n“A weighty speech,” a gentleman in one group observed gravely.\n\n“He brought in too much psychology,” said another voice.\n\n“But it was all true, the absolute truth!”\n\n“Yes, he is first rate at it.”\n\n“He summed it all up.”\n\n“Yes, he summed us up, too,” chimed in another voice. “Do you remember,\nat the beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor\nPavlovitch?”\n\n“And at the end, too. But that was all rot.”\n\n“And obscure too.”\n\n“He was a little too much carried away.”\n\n“It’s unjust, it’s unjust.”\n\n“No, it was smartly done, anyway. He’s had long to wait, but he’s had\nhis say, ha ha!”\n\n“What will the counsel for the defense say?”\n\nIn another group I heard:\n\n“He had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that;\n‘appealing to your sensibilities’—do you remember?”\n\n“Yes, that was awkward of him.”\n\n“He was in too great a hurry.”\n\n“He is a nervous man.”\n\n“We laugh, but what must the prisoner be feeling?”\n\n“Yes, what must it be for Mitya?”\n\nIn a third group:\n\n“What lady is that, the fat one, with the lorgnette, sitting at the\nend?”\n\n“She is a general’s wife, divorced, I know her.”\n\n“That’s why she has the lorgnette.”\n\n“She is not good for much.”\n\n“Oh, no, she is a piquante little woman.”\n\n“Two places beyond her there is a little fair woman, she is prettier.”\n\n“They caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn’t they, eh?”",
            "12": "“Oh, it was smart enough. We’ve heard it before, how often he has told\nthe story at people’s houses!”\n\n“And he couldn’t resist doing it now. That’s vanity.”\n\n“He is a man with a grievance, he he!”\n\n“Yes, and quick to take offense. And there was too much rhetoric, such\nlong sentences.”\n\n“Yes, he tries to alarm us, he kept trying to alarm us. Do you remember\nabout the troika? Something about ‘They have Hamlets, but we have, so\nfar, only Karamazovs!’ That was cleverly said!”\n\n“That was to propitiate the liberals. He is afraid of them.”\n\n“Yes, and he is afraid of the lawyer, too.”\n\n“Yes, what will Fetyukovitch say?”\n\n“Whatever he says, he won’t get round our peasants.”\n\n“Don’t you think so?”\n\nA fourth group:\n\n“What he said about the troika was good, that piece about the other\nnations.”\n\n“And that was true what he said about other nations not standing it.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, in the English Parliament a Member got up last week and speaking\nabout the Nihilists asked the Ministry whether it was not high time to\nintervene, to educate this barbarous people. Ippolit was thinking of\nhim, I know he was. He was talking about that last week.”\n\n“Not an easy job.”\n\n“Not an easy job? Why not?”\n\n“Why, we’d shut up Kronstadt and not let them have any corn. Where\nwould they get it?”\n\n“In America. They get it from America now.”\n\n“Nonsense!”\n\nBut the bell rang, all rushed to their places. Fetyukovitch mounted the\ntribune."

        "title": "X.\nThe Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways",
        "content": {
            "0": "All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out. The\neyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began very simply and\ndirectly, with an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of\nconceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional\nphrases. He was like a man speaking in a circle of intimate and\nsympathetic friends. His voice was a fine one, sonorous and\nsympathetic, and there was something genuine and simple in the very\nsound of it. But every one realized at once that the speaker might\nsuddenly rise to genuine pathos and “pierce the heart with untold\npower.” His language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit\nKirillovitch’s, but he spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with\nmore precision. One thing did not please the ladies: he kept bending\nforward, especially at the beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing,\nbut as though he were about to dart at his listeners, bending his long\nspine in half, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled\nhim to bend almost at right angles.\n\nAt the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly, without\nsystem, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end,\nthese facts formed a whole. His speech might be divided into two parts,\nthe first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge,\nsometimes malicious and sarcastic. But in the second half he suddenly\nchanged his tone, and even his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The\naudience seemed on the look‐out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.",
            "1": "He went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he\npracticed in Petersburg, he had more than once visited provincial towns\nto defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least\na preconceived idea. “That is what has happened to me in the present\ncase,” he explained. “From the very first accounts in the newspapers I\nwas struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the\nprisoner’s favor. What interested me most was a fact which often occurs\nin legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar\nform as in the present case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only\nat the end of my speech, but I will do so at the very beginning, for it\nis my weakness to go to work directly, not keeping my effects in\nreserve and economizing my material. That may be imprudent on my part,\nbut at least it’s sincere. What I have in my mind is this: there is an\noverwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner, and at the same\ntime not one fact that will stand criticism, if it is examined\nseparately. As I followed the case more closely in the papers my idea\nwas more and more confirmed, and I suddenly received from the\nprisoner’s relatives a request to undertake his defense. I at once\nhurried here, and here I became completely convinced. It was to break\ndown this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of\nevidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook\nthe case.”\n\nSo Fetyukovitch began.\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury,” he suddenly protested, “I am new to this\ndistrict. I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of\nturbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he has\ninsulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced\nmany people against him beforehand. Of course I recognize that the\nmoral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him. The\nprisoner is of turbulent and violent temper. Yet he was received in\nsociety here; he was even welcome in the family of my talented friend,\nthe prosecutor.”\n\n(N.B. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience,\nquickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that the\nprosecutor received Mitya against his will, solely because he had\nsomehow interested his wife—a lady of the highest virtue and moral\nworth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her husband,\nespecially in trifles. Mitya’s visits, however, had not been frequent.)",
            "2": "“Nevertheless I venture to suggest,” Fetyukovitch continued, “that in\nspite of his independent mind and just character, my opponent may have\nformed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client. Oh, that is\nso natural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such\nprejudice. Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often\nrelentless. We have, in the talented prosecutor’s speech, heard a stern\nanalysis of the prisoner’s character and conduct, and his severe\ncritical attitude to the case was evident. And, what’s more, he went\ninto psychological subtleties into which he could not have entered, if\nhe had the least conscious and malicious prejudice against the\nprisoner. But there are things which are even worse, even more fatal in\nsuch cases, than the most malicious and consciously unfair attitude. It\nis worse if we are carried away by the artistic instinct, by the desire\nto create, so to speak, a romance, especially if God has endowed us\nwith psychological insight. Before I started on my way here, I was\nwarned in Petersburg, and was myself aware, that I should find here a\ntalented opponent whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained\nhim peculiar renown in legal circles of recent years. But profound as\npsychology is, it’s a knife that cuts both ways.” (Laughter among the\npublic.) “You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can’t boast\nof eloquence. But I will take as an example any point in the\nprosecutor’s speech.\n\n“The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the\nfence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass\npestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over\nthe man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the\nprosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner’s statement that he ran to\nold Grigory out of pity. ‘No,’ he says, ‘such sensibility is impossible\nat such a moment, that’s unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only\nwitness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had\ncommitted the murder, since he would not have run back for any other\nreason.’",
            "3": "“Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it\nto the case the other way round, and our result will be no less\nprobable. The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a\nprecaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he had left in\nhis murdered father’s study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an\namazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an\ninscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. ‘If he\nhad carried that envelope away with him, no one in the world would have\nknown of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the money had\nbeen stolen by the prisoner.’ Those are the prosecutor’s own words. So\non one side you see a complete absence of precaution, a man who has\nlost his head and run away in a fright, leaving that clew on the floor,\nand two minutes later, when he has killed another man, we are entitled\nto assume the most heartless and calculating foresight in him. But even\nadmitting this was so, it is psychological subtlety, I suppose, that\ndiscerns that under certain circumstances I become as bloodthirsty and\nkeen‐sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the next I am as timid and\nblind as a mole. But if I am so bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating\nthat when I kill a man I only run back to find out whether he is alive\nto witness against me, why should I spend five minutes looking after my\nvictim at the risk of encountering other witnesses? Why soak my\nhandkerchief, wiping the blood off his head so that it may be evidence\nagainst me later? If he were so cold‐hearted and calculating, why not\nhit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as\nto kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the\nwitness?",
            "4": "“Again, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left\nanother witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from\nthe two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as\ntheirs, and prove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as\nthough he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness\nor haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen\npaces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was\ngrieved at having killed a man, an old servant; and he flung away the\npestle with a curse, as a murderous weapon. That’s how it must have\nbeen, what other reason could he have had for throwing it so far? And\nif he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man, it\nshows that he was innocent of his father’s murder. Had he murdered him,\nhe would never have run to another victim out of pity; then he would\nhave felt differently; his thoughts would have been centered on\nself‐preservation. He would have had none to spare for pity, that is\nbeyond doubt. On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead\nof spending five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and\ngood‐feeling just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here\nwe have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this\nmethod, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything by\nit. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology lures even most\nserious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously. I am speaking\nof the abuse of psychology, gentlemen.”\n\nSounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were\nagain audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I\nwill only quote some passages from it, some leading points."

        "title": "XI.\nThere Was No Money. There Was No Robbery",
        "content": {
            "0": "There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch’s speech. He\nflatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and\nconsequently, the possibility of their having been stolen.\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury,” he began. “Every new and unprejudiced observer\nmust be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case,\nnamely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of\nproving that there was anything to be stolen. We are told that money\nwas stolen—three thousand roubles—but whether those roubles ever\nexisted, nobody knows. Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who\nhas seen the notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they\nhad been put in the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov. He had\nspoken of it to the prisoner and his brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before\nthe catastrophe. Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it. But not one\nof these three persons had actually seen the notes, no one but\nSmerdyakov had seen them.\n\n“Here the question arises, if it’s true that they did exist, and that\nSmerdyakov had seen them, when did he see them for the last time? What\nif his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back\nin his cash‐box without telling him? Note, that according to\nSmerdyakov’s story the notes were kept under the mattress; the prisoner\nmust have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled;\nthat is carefully recorded in the protocol. How could the prisoner have\nfound the notes without disturbing the bed? How could he have helped\nsoiling with his blood‐ stained hands the fine and spotless linen with\nwhich the bed had been purposely made?",
            "1": "“But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor? Yes, it’s\nworth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat\nsurprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of\nhimself—of himself, observe—that but for that envelope, but for its\nbeing left on the floor, no one in the world would have known of the\nexistence of that envelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the\nprisoner’s having stolen it. And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the\nprosecutor’s own admission, the sole proof on which the charge of\nrobbery rests, ‘otherwise no one would have known of the robbery, nor\nperhaps even of the money.’ But is the mere fact that that scrap of\npaper was lying on the floor a proof that there was money in it, and\nthat that money had been stolen? Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov\nhad seen the money in the envelope. But when, when had he seen it for\nthe last time, I ask you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he told me\nthat he had seen the notes two days before the catastrophe. Then why\nnot imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient\nand hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration, may have\nwhiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out the\nnotes. ‘What’s the use of the envelope?’ he may have asked himself.\n‘She won’t believe the notes are there, but when I show her the thirty\nrainbow‐colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression, you\nmay be sure, it will make her mouth water.’ And so he tears open the\nenvelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor,\nconscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving\nevidence.\n\n“Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and\nsuch an action? Why is it out of the question? But if anything of the\nsort could have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground;\nif there was no money, there was no theft of it. If the envelope on the\nfloor may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may\nI not maintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because\nthe money had been taken from it by its owner?",
            "2": "“But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch\ntook it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police\nsearched the house? In the first place, part of the money was found in\nthe cash‐box, and secondly, he might have taken it out that morning or\nthe evening before to make some other use of it, to give or send it\naway; he may have changed his idea, his plan of action completely,\nwithout thinking it necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov\nbeforehand. And if there is the barest possibility of such an\nexplanation, how can the prisoner be so positively accused of having\ncommitted murder for the sake of robbery, and of having actually\ncarried out that robbery? This is encroaching on the domain of romance.\nIf it is maintained that something has been stolen, the thing must be\nproduced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond doubt. Yet no\none had ever seen these notes.\n\n“Not long ago in Petersburg a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a\nboy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad\ndaylight into a moneychanger’s shop with an ax, and with extraordinary,\ntypical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen\nhundred roubles. Five hours later he was arrested, and, except fifteen\nroubles he had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on\nhim. Moreover, the shopman, on his return to the shop after the murder,\ninformed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the\nnotes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very\nnotes and coins were found on the criminal. This was followed by a full\nand genuine confession on the part of the murderer. That’s what I call\nevidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch\nthe money, and cannot deny its existence. Is it the same in the present\ncase? And yet it is a question of life and death.",
            "3": "“Yes, I shall be told, but he was carousing that night, squandering\nmoney; he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles—where did he\nget the money? But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be\nfound, and the other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows\nthat that money was not the same, and had never been in any envelope.\nBy strict calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry\nthat the prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin’s\nwithout going home, and that he had been nowhere. So he had been all\nthe time in company and therefore could not have divided the three\nthousand in half and hidden half in the town. It’s just this\nconsideration that has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is\nhidden in some crevice at Mokroe. Why not in the dungeons of the castle\nof Udolpho, gentlemen? Isn’t this supposition really too fantastic and\ntoo romantic? And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole\ncharge of robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what\ncould have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles? By what miracle\ncould they have disappeared, since it’s proved the prisoner went\nnowhere else? And we are ready to ruin a man’s life with such tales!\n\n“I shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen\nhundred that he had, and every one knew that he was without money\nbefore that night. Who knew it, pray? The prisoner has made a clear and\nunflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have\nit so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that\nstatement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the\nprisoner. The prosecutor is charmed with his own romance. A man of weak\nwill, who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly\noffered by his betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half\nand sewn it up, but would, even if he had done so, have unpicked it\nevery two days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all\nin a month. All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone that\nbrooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite\ndifferently? What if you’ve been weaving a romance, and about quite a\ndifferent kind of man? That’s just it, you have invented quite a\ndifferent man!",
            "4": "“I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day\nall that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the\ncatastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are\nthese witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court\nalready. Besides, in another man’s hand a crust always seems larger,\nand no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged\nsimply at sight. And the witness Maximov has testified that the\nprisoner had twenty thousand in his hand. You see, gentlemen of the\njury, psychology is a two‐ edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now\nand see what comes of it.\n\n“A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina\nIvanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post. But the\nquestion is: is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an\ninsulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now? The first\nstatement made by the young lady on the subject was different,\nperfectly different. In the second statement we heard only cries of\nresentment and revenge, cries of long‐concealed hatred. And the very\nfact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly, gives us a\nright to conclude that her second piece of evidence may have been\nincorrect also. The prosecutor will not, dare not (his own words) touch\non that story. So be it. I will not touch on it either, but will only\nventure to observe that if a lofty and high‐ principled person, such as\nthat highly respected young lady unquestionably is, if such a person, I\nsay, allows herself suddenly in court to contradict her first\nstatement, with the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner, it is clear\nthat this evidence has been given not impartially, not coolly. Have not\nwe the right to assume that a revengeful woman might have exaggerated\nmuch? Yes, she may well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and\nhumiliation of her offering him the money. No, it was offered in such a\nway that it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy‐going\nas the prisoner, above all, as he expected to receive shortly from his\nfather the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him. It\nwas unreflecting of him, but it was just his irresponsible want of\nreflection that made him so confident that his father would give him\nthe money, that he would get it, and so could always dispatch the money\nentrusted to him and repay the debt.",
            "5": "“But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have\nset aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That’s not his\ncharacter, he tells us, he couldn’t have had such feelings. But yet he\ntalked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the\ntwo extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is\njust such a two‐sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that\neven when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can\npull himself up, if something strikes him on the other side. And on the\nother side is love—that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and\nfor that love he needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his\nmistress. If she were to say to him, ‘I am yours, I won’t have Fyodor\nPavlovitch,’ then he must have money to take her away. That was more\nimportant than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That\nanxiety was just what he was suffering from—what is there improbable in\nhis laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency?\n\n“But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the\nexpected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he\nmeant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. ‘If\nFyodor Pavlovitch doesn’t give the money,’ he thought, ‘I shall be put\nin the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.’ And then the idea\npresented itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay\nbefore her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck,\nand say, ‘I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.’ So here we have already a\ntwofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of\nhis eye, why he shouldn’t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred\nat a time. Why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he\nhas a sense of honor, granted that it’s misplaced, granted it’s often\nmistaken, yet it exists and amounts to a passion, and he has proved\nthat.",
            "6": "“But now the affair becomes even more complex; his jealous torments\nreach a climax, and those same two questions torture his fevered brain\nmore and more: ‘If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the\nmeans to go off with Grushenka?’ If he behaved wildly, drank, and made\ndisturbances in the taverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps\nbecause he was wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance.\nThese two questions became so acute that they drove him at last to\ndespair. He sent his younger brother to beg for the last time for the\nthree thousand roubles, but without waiting for a reply, burst in\nhimself and ended by beating the old man in the presence of witnesses.\nAfter that he had no prospect of getting it from any one; his father\nwould not give it him after that beating.\n\n“The same evening he struck himself on the breast, just on the upper\npart of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his brother\nthat he had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he would\nremain a scoundrel, for he foresaw that he would not use that means,\nthat he wouldn’t have the character, that he wouldn’t have the\nwill‐power to do it. Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the\nevidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so\nspontaneously and convincingly? And why, on the contrary, does he force\nme to believe in money hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the\ncastle of Udolpho?\n\n“The same evening, after his talk with his brother, the prisoner wrote\nthat fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous\nproof of the prisoner having committed robbery! ‘I shall beg from every\none, and if I don’t get it I shall murder my father and shall take the\nenvelope with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as\nIvan has gone.’ A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must\nhave been he. ‘It has all been done as he wrote,’ cries the prosecutor.",
            "7": "“But in the first place, it’s the letter of a drunken man and written\nin great irritation; secondly, he writes of the envelope from what he\nhas heard from Smerdyakov again, for he has not seen the envelope\nhimself; and thirdly, he wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he\ndid it? Did the prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did\nhe find the money, did that money exist indeed? And was it to get money\nthat the prisoner ran off, if you remember? He ran off post‐haste not\nto steal, but to find out where she was, the woman who had crushed him.\nHe was not running to carry out a program, to carry out what he had\nwritten, that is, not for an act of premeditated robbery, but he ran\nsuddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous fury. Yes! I shall be told, but\nwhen he got there and murdered him he seized the money, too. But did he\nmurder him after all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with\nindignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery, if it’s impossible to\nstate accurately what he has stolen; that’s an axiom. But did he murder\nhim without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn’t\nthat, too, a romance?”"

            "0": "“Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man’s life is at\nstake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor\nhimself admit that until to‐day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of\na full and conscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he\nsaw that fatal drunken letter which was produced in court to‐day. ‘All\nwas done as written.’ But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to\nseek her, solely to find out where she was. That’s a fact that can’t be\ndisputed. Had she been at home, he would not have run away, but would\nhave remained at her side, and so would not have done what he promised\nin the letter. He ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time\nvery likely he did not even remember his drunken letter. ‘He snatched\nup the pestle,’ they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice of\npsychology was built on that pestle—why he was bound to look at that\npestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A very\ncommonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that pestle had\nnot been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from which it was\nsnatched by the prisoner, but had been put away in a cupboard? It would\nnot have caught the prisoner’s eye, and he would have run away without\na weapon, with empty hands, and then he would certainly not have killed\nany one. How then can I look upon the pestle as a proof of\npremeditation?",
            "1": "“Yes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two\ndays before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was\nquiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a\nKaramazov could not help quarreling, forsooth! But my answer to that\nis, that, if he was planning such a murder in accordance with his\nletter, he certainly would not have quarreled even with a shopman, and\nprobably would not have gone into the tavern at all, because a person\nplotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement, seeks to efface\nhimself, to avoid being seen and heard, and that not from calculation,\nbut from instinct. Gentlemen of the jury, the psychological method is a\ntwo‐edged weapon, and we, too, can use it. As for all this shouting in\ntaverns throughout the month, don’t we often hear children, or\ndrunkards coming out of taverns shout, ‘I’ll kill you’? but they don’t\nmurder any one. And that fatal letter—isn’t that simply drunken\nirritability, too? Isn’t that simply the shout of the brawler outside\nthe tavern, ‘I’ll kill you! I’ll kill the lot of you!’ Why not, why\ncould it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter ‘fatal’\nrather than absurd? Because his father has been found murdered, because\na witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in\nhis hand, and was knocked down by him: therefore, we are told,\neverything was done as he had planned in writing, and the letter was\nnot ‘absurd,’ but ‘fatal.’",
            "2": "“Now, thank God! we’ve come to the real point: ‘since he was in the\ngarden, he must have murdered him.’ In those few words: ‘since he\n_was_, then he _must_’ lies the whole case for the prosecution. He was\nthere, so he must have. And what if there is no _must_ about it, even\nif he was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence—the\ncoincidences—are really suggestive. But examine all these facts\nseparately, regardless of their connection. Why, for instance, does the\nprosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner’s statement that\nhe ran away from his father’s window? Remember the sarcasms in which\nthe prosecutor indulged at the expense of the respectful and ‘pious’\nsentiments which suddenly came over the murderer. But what if there\nwere something of the sort, a feeling of religious awe, if not of\nfilial respect? ‘My mother must have been praying for me at that\nmoment,’ were the prisoner’s words at the preliminary inquiry, and so\nhe ran away as soon as he convinced himself that Madame Svyetlov was\nnot in his father’s house. ‘But he could not convince himself by\nlooking through the window,’ the prosecutor objects. But why couldn’t\nhe? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner. Some\nword might have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation\nwhich showed the prisoner that she was not there. Why should we assume\neverything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it? A\nthousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest\nimagination.",
            "3": "“ ‘Yes, but Grigory saw the door open and so the prisoner certainly was\nin the house, therefore he killed him.’ Now about that door, gentlemen\nof the jury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness\nas to that door, and he was at the time in such a condition, that— But\nsupposing the door was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying\nit, from an instinct of self‐defense, natural in his position;\nsupposing he did go into the house—well, what then? How does it follow\nthat because he was there he committed the murder? He might have dashed\nin, run through the rooms; might have pushed his father away; might\nhave struck him; but as soon as he had made sure Madame Svyetlov was\nnot there, he may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and\nthat he had not killed his father. And it was perhaps just because he\nhad escaped from the temptation to kill his father, because he had a\nclear conscience and was rejoicing at not having killed him, that he\nwas capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and compassion, and\nleapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after\nhe had, in his excitement, knocked him down.",
            "4": "“With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the\ndreadful state of the prisoner’s mind at Mokroe when love again lay\nbefore him calling him to new life, while love was impossible for him\nbecause he had his father’s bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond\nthat corpse—retribution. And yet the prosecutor allowed him love, which\nhe explained, according to his method, talking about his drunken\ncondition, about a criminal being taken to execution, about it being\nstill far off, and so on and so on. But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor,\nhave you not invented a new personality? Is the prisoner so coarse and\nheartless as to be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges\nto escape punishment, if his hands were really stained with his\nfather’s blood? No, no, no! As soon as it was made plain to him that\nshe loved him and called him to her side, promising him new happiness,\noh! then, I protest he must have felt the impulse to suicide doubled,\ntrebled, and must have killed himself, if he had his father’s murder on\nhis conscience. Oh, no! he would not have forgotten where his pistols\nlay! I know the prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to\nhim by the prosecutor is inconsistent with his character. He would have\nkilled himself, that’s certain. He did not kill himself just because\n‘his mother’s prayers had saved him,’ and he was innocent of his\nfather’s blood. He was troubled, he was grieving that night at Mokroe\nonly about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would\nrecover, that his blow had not been fatal, and that he would not have\nto suffer for it. Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts?\nWhat trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying?\n\n“But we shall be told at once again, ‘There is his father’s corpse! If\nhe ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?’ Here, I repeat,\nyou have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not\nhe? There’s no one to put in his place.",
            "5": "“Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually\ntrue that there is no one else at all? We’ve heard the prosecutor count\non his fingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They\nwere five in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been\nresponsible—the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There\nare left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor\ndramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because\nhe had no one else to fix on, that had there been a sixth person, even\na phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned the charge against\nSmerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other. But, gentlemen\nof the jury, why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion? There are\ntwo persons—the prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you\naccuse my client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And\nyou have no one else only because you have determined to exclude\nSmerdyakov from all suspicion.\n\n“It’s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two\nbrothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him:\nthere are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure\nreport, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a\ncombination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In\nthe first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that\nfit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has\nfelt obliged to make a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov’s sudden\nsuicide on the eve of the trial. Then the equally startling evidence\ngiven in court to‐day by the elder of the prisoner’s brothers, who had\nbelieved in his guilt, but has to‐day produced a bundle of notes and\nproclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer. Oh, I fully share the court’s\nand the prosecutor’s conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from\nbrain fever, that his statement may really be a desperate effort,\nplanned in delirium, to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the\ndead man. But again Smerdyakov’s name is pronounced, again there is a\nsuggestion of mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete. And\nperhaps it may one day be explained. But we won’t go into that now. Of\nthat later.",
            "6": "“The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might\nmake a few remarks about the character‐sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with\nsubtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent I\ncannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him and\ntalked to him, and he made a very different impression on me. He was\nweak in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no\nmeans the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in\nhim no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There\nwas no simplicity about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary,\nan extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _naïveté_, and an\nintelligence of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in\ntaking him for weak‐minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I\nleft him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful\ncreature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I\nmade some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and\nwould clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of\n‘stinking Lizaveta.’ He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and\nhis wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed and jeered\nat Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman. He\nused often to say that he hadn’t the means to do so. I fancy he loved\nno one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself. His\nconception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirt‐fronts\nand polished boots. Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of\nFyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he might well have\nresented his position, compared with that of his master’s legitimate\nsons. They had everything, he nothing. They had all the rights, they\nhad the inheritance, while he was only the cook. He told me himself\nthat he had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope.\nThe destination of that sum—a sum which would have made his career—must\nhave been hateful to him. Moreover, he saw three thousand roubles in\nnew rainbow‐colored notes. (I asked him about that on purpose.) Oh,\nbeware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at\nonce! And it was the first time he had seen so much money in the hands\nof one man. The sight of the rainbow‐colored notes may have made a\nmorbid impression on his imagination, but with no immediate results.",
            "7": "“The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us\nall the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov’s guilt,\nand asked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit. But he\nmay not have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite\nnaturally, but it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man\nmay have recovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining\nconsciousness, as happens with epileptics.\n\n“The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the\nmurder. But it is very easy to point out that moment. He might have\nwaked up from deep sleep (for he was only asleep—an epileptic fit is\nalways followed by a deep sleep) at that moment when the old Grigory\nshouted at the top of his voice ‘Parricide!’ That shout in the dark and\nstillness may have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less\nsound at the moment: he might naturally have waked up an hour before.\n\n“Getting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite\nmotive towards the sound to see what’s the matter. His head is still\nclouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in\nthe garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news\nfrom his master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind\nsets to work at once. He hears all the details from his frightened\nmaster, and gradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an\nidea—terrible, but seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old\nman, take the three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young\nmaster. A terrible lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he\nrealized his security from detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible\nimpulses come so often when there is a favorable opportunity, and\nespecially with murderers who have had no idea of committing a murder\nbeforehand. And Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan.\nWith what weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what\nfor, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a career for\nhim. Oh, I am not contradicting myself—the money may have existed. And\nperhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to find it, where his master kept\nit. And the covering of the money—the torn envelope on the floor?",
            "8": "“Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that\nonly an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope\non the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided\nleaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as I listened\nthat I was hearing something very familiar, and, would you believe it,\nI have heard that very argument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov\nwould have behaved, precisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself.\nWhat’s more, it struck me at the time. I fancied that there was an\nartificial simplicity about him; that he was in a hurry to suggest this\nidea to me that I might fancy it was my own. He insinuated it, as it\nwere. Did he not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it\nto the talented prosecutor?\n\n“I shall be asked, ‘What about the old woman, Grigory’s wife? She heard\nthe sick man moaning close by, all night.’ Yes, she heard it, but that\nevidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly\nthat she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the\npoor beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night.\nAnd that’s natural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up,\nannoyed at being waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours\nlater, again a groan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same\nthing again two hours later—three times altogether in the night. Next\nmorning the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been\ngroaning all night and keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to\nhim: the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember, he only\nremembers the moments of waking, so he feels he has been waked up all\nnight.\n\n“But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his\nlast letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to\nboth? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may\nnot have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are\ntwo very different things. Despair may be vindictive and\nirreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his hands on himself, may well\nhave felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had envied all his life.",
            "9": "“Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is\nthere unlikely in all I have put before you just now? Find the error in\nmy reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And if there is\nbut a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my\npropositions, do not condemn him. And is there only a shade? I swear by\nall that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I\nhave just put forward. What troubles me and makes me indignant is that\nof all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution against the\nprisoner, there is not a single one certain and irrefutable. And yet\nthe unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation of these facts.\nYes, the accumulated effect is awful: the blood, the blood dripping\nfrom his fingers, the bloodstained shirt, the dark night resounding\nwith the shout ‘Parricide!’ and the old man falling with a broken head.\nAnd then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! this\nhas so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the\njury, can it bias your minds? Remember, you have been given absolute\npower to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the more\nterrible its responsibility.\n\n“I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but\nsuppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless\nclient had stained his hands with his father’s blood. This is only\nhypothesis, I repeat; I never for one instant doubt of his innocence.\nBut, so be it, I assume that my client is guilty of parricide. Even so,\nhear what I have to say. I have it in my heart to say something more to\nyou, for I feel that there must be a great conflict in your hearts and\nminds.... Forgive my referring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of\nthe jury, but I want to be truthful and sincere to the end. Let us all\nbe sincere!”\n\nAt this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. The\nlast words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that\nevery one felt that he really might have something to say, and that\nwhat he was about to say would be of the greatest consequence. But the\nPresident, hearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear\nthe court if such an incident were repeated. Every sound was hushed and\nFetyukovitch began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he\nhad used hitherto."

            "0": "“It’s not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with\nruin, gentlemen of the jury,” he began, “what is really damning for my\nclient is one fact—the dead body of his father. Had it been an ordinary\ncase of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the\ntriviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of the\nevidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, you\nwould have hesitated to ruin a man’s life simply from the prejudice\nagainst him which he has, alas! only too well deserved. But it’s not an\nordinary case of murder, it’s a case of parricide. That impresses men’s\nminds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness\nof the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an\nunprejudiced mind. How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he\ncommitted the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one,\nalmost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.\n\n“Yes, it’s a fearful thing to shed a father’s blood—the father who has\nbegotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over my\nillnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness,\nand has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a\nfather—that’s inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father—a\nreal father? What is the meaning of that great word? What is the great\nidea in that name? We have just indicated in part what a true father is\nand what he ought to be. In the case in which we are now so deeply\noccupied and over which our hearts are aching—in the present case, the\nfather, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, did not correspond to that\nconception of a father to which we have just referred. That’s the\nmisfortune. And indeed some fathers are a misfortune. Let us examine\nthis misfortune rather more closely: we must shrink from nothing,\ngentlemen of the jury, considering the importance of the decision you\nhave to make. It’s our particular duty not to shrink from any idea,\nlike children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutor happily\nexpresses it.",
            "1": "“But in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent (and he\nwas my opponent before I opened my lips) exclaimed several times, ‘Oh,\nI will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come\ndown from Petersburg. I accuse, but I defend also!’ He exclaimed that\nseveral times, but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was\nfor twenty‐three years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him\nby the only man who had been kind to him, as a child in his father’s\nhouse, might not such a man well have remembered for twenty‐three years\nhow he ran in his father’s back‐yard, ‘without boots on his feet and\nwith his little trousers hanging by one button’—to use the expression\nof the kind‐hearted doctor, Herzenstube?\n\n“Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at this\nmisfortune, why repeat what we all know already? What did my client\nmeet with when he arrived here, at his father’s house, and why depict\nmy client as a heartless egoist and monster? He is uncontrolled, he is\nwild and unruly—we are trying him now for that—but who is responsible\nfor his life? Who is responsible for his having received such an\nunseemly bringing up, in spite of his excellent disposition and his\ngrateful and sensitive heart? Did any one train him to be reasonable?\nWas he enlightened by study? Did any one love him ever so little in his\nchildhood? My client was left to the care of Providence like a beast of\nthe field. He thirsted perhaps to see his father after long years of\nseparation. A thousand times perhaps he may, recalling his childhood,\nhave driven away the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish\ndreams and with all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to\nforgive his father! And what awaited him? He was met by cynical taunts,\nsuspicions and wrangling about money. He heard nothing but revolting\ntalk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy, and at last he\nsaw his father seducing his mistress from him with his own money. Oh,\ngentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting! And that old man\nwas always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of his son. He\nslandered him in society, injured him, calumniated him, bought up his\nunpaid debts to get him thrown into prison.",
            "2": "“Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly,\nand uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed,\nexceedingly tender‐hearted, only they don’t express it. Don’t laugh,\ndon’t laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly\njust now at my client for loving Schiller—loving the sublime and\nbeautiful! I should not have laughed at that in his place. Yes, such\nnatures—oh, let me speak in defense of such natures, so often and so\ncruelly misunderstood—these natures often thirst for tenderness,\ngoodness, and justice, as it were, in contrast to themselves, their\nunruliness, their ferocity—they thirst for it unconsciously. Passionate\nand fierce on the surface, they are painfully capable of loving woman,\nfor instance, and with a spiritual and elevated love. Again do not\nlaugh at me, this is very often the case in such natures. But they\ncannot hide their passions—sometimes very coarse—and that is\nconspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen. Their passions\nare quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and lofty creature\nthat seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks to correct\nhimself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, ‘sublime and\nbeautiful,’ however much the expression has been ridiculed.\n\n“I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client’s\nengagement. But I may say half a word. What we heard just now was not\nevidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and\nit was not for her—oh, not for her!—to reproach him with treachery, for\nshe has betrayed him! If she had had but a little time for reflection\nshe would not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her! No, my\nclient is not a monster, as she called him!\n\n“The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His Crucifixion said: ‘I am the\nGood Shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, so\nthat not one of them might be lost.’ Let not a man’s soul be lost\nthrough us!\n\n“I asked just now what does ‘father’ mean, and exclaimed that it was a\ngreat word, a precious name. But one must use words honestly,\ngentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names: such a\nfather as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve\nto be. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an\nimpossibility. Love cannot be created from nothing: only God can create\nsomething from nothing.",
            "3": "“ ‘Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,’ the apostle writes,\nfrom a heart glowing with love. It’s not for the sake of my client that\nI quote these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has\nauthorized me to preach to fathers? No one. But as a man and a citizen\nI make my appeal—_vivos voco!_ We are not long on earth, we do many\nevil deeds and say many evil words. So let us all catch a favorable\nmoment when we are all together to say a good word to each other.\nThat’s what I am doing: while I am in this place I take advantage of my\nopportunity. Not for nothing is this tribune given us by the highest\nauthority—all Russia hears us! I am not speaking only for the fathers\nhere present, I cry aloud to all fathers: ‘Fathers, provoke not your\nchildren to wrath.’ Yes, let us first fulfill Christ’s injunction\nourselves and only then venture to expect it of our children. Otherwise\nwe are not fathers, but enemies of our children, and they are not our\nchildren, but our enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves.\n‘What measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you again’—it’s not I\nwho say that, it’s the Gospel precept, measure to others according as\nthey measure to you. How can we blame children if they measure us\naccording to our measure?\n\n“Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having\nsecretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no\none knew anything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some\nbricks. It was opened and inside was found the body of a new‐born child\nwhich she had killed. In the same box were found the skeletons of two\nother babies which, according to her own confession, she had killed at\nthe moment of their birth.\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave\nbirth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them? Would any one\nventure to give her the sacred name of mother? Let us be bold,\ngentlemen, let us be audacious even: it’s our duty to be so at this\nmoment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like the Moscow\nwomen in Ostrovsky’s play, who are scared at the sound of certain\nwords. No, let us prove that the progress of the last few years has\ntouched even us, and let us say plainly, the father is not merely he\nwho begets the child, but he who begets it and does his duty by it.",
            "4": "“Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other\ninterpretation of the word ‘father,’ which insists that any father,\neven though he be a monster, even though he be the enemy of his\nchildren, still remains my father simply because he begot me. But this\nis, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my\nintellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say, _on faith_,\nlike many other things which I do not understand, but which religion\nbids me believe. But in that case let it be kept outside the sphere of\nactual life. In the sphere of actual life, which has, indeed, its own\nrights, but also lays upon us great duties and obligations, in that\nsphere, if we want to be humane—Christian, in fact—we must, or ought\nto, act only upon convictions justified by reason and experience, which\nhave been passed through the crucible of analysis; in a word, we must\nact rationally, and not as though in dream and delirium, that we may\nnot do harm, that we may not ill‐treat and ruin a man. Then it will be\nreal Christian work, not only mystic, but rational and\nphilanthropic....”\n\nThere was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the\ncourt, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let\nhim finish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at\nonce. The orator went on.\n\n“Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin\nto reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not\nimpose on them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy\nfather involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature,\nespecially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his\ncompanions. The conventional answer to this question is: ‘He begot you,\nand you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love\nhim.’ The youth involuntarily reflects: ‘But did he love me when he\nbegot me?’ he asks, wondering more and more. ‘Was it for my sake he\nbegot me? He did not know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the\nmoment of passion, perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he has only\ntransmitted to me a propensity to drunkenness—that’s all he’s done for\nme.... Why am I bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has\ncared nothing for me all my life after?’",
            "5": "“Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do not\nexpect an impossible restraint from a young mind. ‘Drive nature out of\nthe door and it will fly in at the window,’ and, above all, let us not\nbe afraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates\nof reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas. How shall it be\ndecided? Why, like this. Let the son stand before his father and ask\nhim, ‘Father, tell me, why must I love you? Father, show me that I must\nlove you,’ and if that father is able to answer him and show him good\nreason, we have a real, normal, parental relation, not resting on\nmystical prejudice, but on a rational, responsible and strictly\nhumanitarian basis. But if he does not, there’s an end to the family\ntie. He is not a father to him, and the son has a right to look upon\nhim as a stranger, and even an enemy. Our tribune, gentlemen of the\njury, ought to be a school of true and sound ideas.”\n\n(Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic\napplause. Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of\nit applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded. Shrieks and\nexclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were\nsitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his bell\nwith all his might. He was obviously irritated by the behavior of the\naudience, but did not venture to clear the court as he had threatened.\nEven persons of high position, old men with stars on their breasts,\nsitting on specially reserved seats behind the judges, applauded the\norator and waved their handkerchiefs. So that when the noise died down,\nthe President confined himself to repeating his stern threat to clear\nthe court, and Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his\nspeech.)",
            "6": "“Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much\nhas been said to‐day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to\nface with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist most\nemphatically it was not for money he ran to his father’s house: the\ncharge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not\nto murder him he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that\ndesign he would, at least, have taken the precaution of arming himself\nbeforehand. The brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing\nwhy he did it. Granted that he deceived his father by tapping at the\nwindow, granted that he made his way in—I’ve said already that I do not\nfor a moment believe that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it\nfor a moment. Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that’s holy, if it had\nnot been his father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running\nthrough the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there,\nhave made off, post‐haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He\nwould have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he\nhad no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted to know\nwas where she was. But his father, his father! The mere sight of the\nfather who had hated him from his childhood, had been his enemy, his\npersecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough! A feeling of\nhatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding his reason.\nIt all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of madness and\ninsanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and unconsciously\n(like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its eternal laws.\n\n“But the prisoner even then did not murder him—I maintain that, I cry\nthat aloud!—no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant\ndisgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him.\nHad he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only\nknocked his father down perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he\nran away, he did not know whether he had killed the old man. Such a\nmurder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the\nmurder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can\nonly be reckoned parricide by prejudice.",
            "7": "“But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did\nthis murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict\nand punish him, he will say to himself: ‘These people have done nothing\nfor my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot,\nnothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have\nnot given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and\nnakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I\nowe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked\nand I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.’ That is what\nhe will say, gentlemen of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty\nyou will only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he\nwill curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same\ntime you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man, for\nhe will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life.\n\n“But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful\npunishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and\nregenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will\nsee, you will hear how he will tremble and be horror‐struck. ‘How can I\nendure this mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?’\nThat’s what he will exclaim.\n\n“Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen\nof the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and\nloving action, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which,\nin their limitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with\nmercy, show it love, and it will curse its past, for there are many\ngood impulses in it. Such a heart will expand and see that God is\nmerciful and that men are good and just. He will be horror‐stricken; he\nwill be crushed by remorse and the vast obligation laid upon him\nhenceforth. And he will not say then, ‘I am quits,’ but will say, ‘I am\nguilty in the sight of all men and am more unworthy than all.’ With\ntears of penitence and poignant, tender anguish, he will exclaim:\n‘Others are better than I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!’ Oh,\nthis act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything\nlike real evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce: ‘Yes, he\nis guilty.’",
            "8": "“Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you\nhear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our\nglorious history? It is not for an insignificant person like me to\nremind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment\nonly, but also for the salvation of the criminal! Let other nations\nthink of retribution and the letter of the law, we will cling to the\nspirit and the meaning—the salvation and the reformation of the lost.\nIf this is true, if Russia and her justice are such, she may go forward\nwith good cheer! Do not try to scare us with your frenzied troikas from\nwhich all the nations stand aside in disgust. Not a runaway troika, but\nthe stately chariot of Russia will move calmly and majestically to its\ngoal. In your hands is the fate of my client, in your hands is the fate\nof Russian justice. You will defend it, you will save it, you will\nprove that there are men to watch over it, that it is in good hands!”"

            "0": "This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of\nthe audience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the\nquestion to stop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two\nimportant personages shed tears. The President submitted, and even\npostponed ringing his bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would\nbe the suppression of something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards.\nThe orator himself was genuinely touched.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make\ncertain objections. People looked at him with hatred. “What? What’s the\nmeaning of it? He positively dares to make objections,” the ladies\nbabbled. But if the whole world of ladies, including his wife, had\nprotested he could not have been stopped at that moment. He was pale,\nhe was shaking with emotion, his first phrases were even\nunintelligible, he gasped for breath, could hardly speak clearly, lost\nthe thread. But he soon recovered himself. Of this new speech of his I\nwill quote only a few sentences.\n\n“... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this\ndefense if not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking\nwas poetry. Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears\nopen the envelope and throws it on the floor. We are even told what he\nsaid while engaged in this strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy?\nAnd what proof have we that he had taken out the money? Who heard what\nhe said? The weak‐minded idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic\nhero, avenging society for his illegitimate birth—isn’t this a romance\nin the Byronic style? And the son who breaks into his father’s house\nand murders him without murdering him is not even a romance—this is a\nsphinx setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself. If he\nmurdered him, he murdered him, and what’s the meaning of his murdering\nhim without having murdered him—who can make head or tail of this?",
            "1": "“Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound\nideas and from this tribune of ‘sound ideas’ is heard a solemn\ndeclaration that to call the murder of a father ‘parricide’ is nothing\nbut a prejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is\nto ask his father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What\nwill become of the foundations of society? What will become of the\nfamily? Parricide, it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants’\nwives. The most precious, the most sacred guarantees for the destiny\nand future of Russian justice are presented to us in a perverted and\nfrivolous form, simply to attain an object—to obtain the justification\nof something which cannot be justified. ‘Oh, crush him by mercy,’ cries\nthe counsel for the defense; but that’s all the criminal wants, and\nto‐morrow it will be seen how much he is crushed. And is not the\ncounsel for the defense too modest in asking only for the acquittal of\nthe prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of the parricide to\ncommemorate his exploit among future generations? Religion and the\nGospel are corrected—that’s all mysticism, we are told, and ours is the\nonly true Christianity which has been subjected to the analysis of\nreason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false semblance\nof Christ! ‘What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you again,’\ncried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that Christ\nteaches us to measure as it is measured to us—and this from the tribune\nof truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve of\nmaking speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance\nwith what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of\nuse to produce a certain effect—all to serve the purpose! But what\nChrist commands us is something very different: He bids us beware of\ndoing this, because the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive\nand to turn the other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as\nthey measure to us. This is what our God has taught us and not that to\nforbid children to murder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not\nfrom the tribune of truth and good sense correct the Gospel of our\nLord, Whom the counsel for the defense deigns to call only ‘the\ncrucified lover of humanity,’ in opposition to all orthodox Russia,\nwhich calls to Him, ‘For Thou art our God!’ ”",
            "2": "At this the President intervened and checked the over‐zealous speaker,\nbegging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on,\nas presidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy.\nThe public was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.\nFetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to\nlay his hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few\nwords full of dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically,\non “romancing” and “psychology,” and in an appropriate place quoted,\n“Jupiter, you are angry, therefore you are wrong,” which provoked a\nburst of approving laughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch\nwas by no means like Jupiter. Then, _à propos_ of the accusation that\nhe was teaching the young generation to murder their fathers,\nFetyukovitch observed, with great dignity, that he would not even\nanswer. As for the prosecutor’s charge of uttering unorthodox opinions,\nFetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he had\nexpected in this court to be secure from accusations “damaging to my\nreputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.” But at these words the\nPresident pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch concluded his speech\nwith a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court. And Ippolit\nKirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, “crushed for good.”\n\nThen the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said very\nlittle. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look\nof strength and independence with which he had entered in the morning\nhad almost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through an\nexperience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life\nsomething very important he had not understood till then. His voice was\nweak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of\nhumility, defeat and submission.",
            "3": "“What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come\nfor me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring\nman! But, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father’s\nblood! For the last time I repeat, it wasn’t I killed him! I was\nerring, but I loved what is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but\nI lived like a wild beast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many\nthings about myself that I did not know; but it’s not true that I\nkilled my father, the prosecutor is mistaken. I thank my counsel, too.\nI cried listening to him; but it’s not true that I killed my father,\nand he needn’t have supposed it. And don’t believe the doctors. I am\nperfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you spare me, if you let me\ngo, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. I give you my word\nbefore God I will! And if you will condemn me, I’ll break my sword over\nmy head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob me of my\nGod! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen ...\nspare me!”\n\nHe almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly\narticulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the\nquestions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.\n\nBut I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire\nfor consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge\nto the jury was rather feeble. “Be impartial, don’t be influenced by\nthe eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember\nthat there is a great responsibility laid upon you,” and so on and so\non.\n\nThe jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move\nabout, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at\nthe buffet. It was very late, almost one o’clock in the night, but\nnobody went away: the strain was so great that no one could think of\nrepose. All waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too\nmuch to say, for the ladies were only in a state of hysterical\nimpatience and their hearts were untroubled. An acquittal, they\nthought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves for a dramatic\nmoment of general enthusiasm. I must own there were many among the men,\ntoo, who were convinced that an acquittal was inevitable. Some were\npleased, others frowned, while some were simply dejected, not wanting\nhim to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch himself was confident of his success.\nHe was surrounded by people congratulating him and fawning upon him.",
            "4": "“There are,” he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, “there are\ninvisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury.\nOne feels during one’s speech if they are being formed. I was aware of\nthem. They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.”\n\n“What will our peasants say now?” said one stout, cross‐looking, pock‐\nmarked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a group\nof gentlemen engaged in conversation.\n\n“But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks among\nthem.”\n\n“Yes, there are clerks,” said a member of the district council, joining\nthe group.\n\n“And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a\njuryman?”\n\n“What of him?”\n\n“He is a man with brains.”\n\n“But he never speaks.”\n\n“He is no great talker, but so much the better. There’s no need for the\nPetersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself.\nHe’s the father of twelve children. Think of that!”\n\n“Upon my word, you don’t suppose they won’t acquit him?” one of our\nyoung officials exclaimed in another group.\n\n“They’ll acquit him for certain,” said a resolute voice.\n\n“It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!” cried the\nofficial. “Suppose he did murder him—there are fathers and fathers!\nAnd, besides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done\nnothing but swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man\ndown. But it was a pity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an\nabsurd theory! If I’d been in Fetyukovitch’s place, I should simply\nhave said straight out: ‘He murdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it\nall!’ ”\n\n“That’s what he did, only without saying, ‘Hang it all!’ ”\n\n“No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,” put in a third\nvoice.\n\n“Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had\ncut the throat of her lover’s lawful wife.”\n\n“Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.”\n\n“That makes no difference. She began cutting it.”\n\n“What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasn’t\nit?”\n\n“Splendid!”\n\n“And about mysticism, too!”\n\n“Oh, drop mysticism, do!” cried some one else; “think of Ippolit and\nhis fate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out\nto‐morrow for Mitya’s sake.”\n\n“Is she here?”\n\n“What an idea! If she’d been here she’d have scratched them out in\ncourt. She is at home with toothache. He he he!”\n\n“He he he!”\n\nIn a third group:\n\n“I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.”",
            "5": "“I should not be surprised if he turns the ‘Metropolis’ upside down to‐\nmorrow. He will be drinking for ten days!”\n\n“Oh, the devil!”\n\n“The devil’s bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not\nhere?”\n\n“Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it’s not the thing\nto break your father’s head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?”\n\n“The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?”\n\n“Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!”\n\n“And to‐morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his\npurpose.”\n\n“What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had\nin Russia?”\n\nBut the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither\nmore nor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the\npublic had taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into\nthe court. At last! I won’t repeat the questions in order, and, indeed,\nI have forgotten them. I remember only the answer to the President’s\nfirst and chief question: “Did the prisoner commit the murder for the\nsake of robbery and with premeditation?” (I don’t remember the exact\nwords.) There was a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the\nyoungest of the clerks, pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the\ndeathlike stillness of the court:\n\n“Yes, guilty!”\n\nAnd the same answer was repeated to every question: “Yes, guilty!” and\nwithout the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;\nalmost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.\nThe deathlike silence in the court was not broken—all seemed petrified:\nthose who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager\nfor his acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was\nfollowed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were\npleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their\njoy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged\ntheir shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this.\nBut how shall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they\nwould create a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears.\nThen suddenly the whole court rang with exclamations: “What’s the\nmeaning of it? What next?” They leapt up from their places. They seemed\nto fancy that it might be at once reconsidered and reversed. At that\ninstant Mitya suddenly stood up and cried in a heartrending voice,\nstretching his hands out before him:",
            "6": "“I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of my\nfather’s blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on\nthe other woman!”\n\nHe could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was\nheard all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own.\nFrom the farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing\nshriek—it was Grushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the\ncourt again before the beginning of the lawyers’ speeches. Mitya was\ntaken away. The passing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The\nwhole court was in a hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember\na few exclamations I heard on the steps as I went out.\n\n“He’ll have a twenty years’ trip to the mines!”\n\n“Not less.”\n\n“Well, our peasants have stood firm.”\n\n“And have done for our Mitya.”\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE"

She sat and\ntalked to him in the very room in which she had once received\nGrushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high\nfever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial\nordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house,\ndisregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the\npublic. One of the two relations who lived with her had departed to\nMoscow immediately after the scene in court, the other remained. But if\nboth had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her\nresolution, and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by\nhim day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him. The\nfamous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as\nto the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors encouraged\nKaterina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet\ngive them positive hopes of recovery.\n\nAlyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day. But this time he had\nspecially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to\napproach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another\nengagement that could not be put off for that same morning, and there\nwas need of haste.\n\nThey had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was\npale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of\nhysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha\nhad come to her.",
            "1": "“Don’t worry about his decision,” she said, with confident emphasis to\nAlyosha. “One way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape.\nThat unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle—not he, not Dmitri\nFyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has\nsacrificed himself for his brother,” Katya added, with flashing\neyes—“told me the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has\nalready entered into negotiations.... I’ve told you something\nalready.... You see, it will probably come off at the third _étape_\nfrom here, when the party of prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh,\nit’s a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the\nsuperintendent of the third _étape_. But we don’t know yet who will be\nin charge of the party, and it’s impossible to find that out so long\nbeforehand. To‐morrow perhaps I will show you in detail the whole plan\nwhich Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of\nneed.... That was when—do you remember?—you found us quarreling. He had\njust gone down‐stairs, but seeing you I made him come back; do you\nremember? Do you know what we were quarreling about then?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” said Alyosha.",
            "2": "“Of course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He\nhad told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling\nabout it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because,\nwhen he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would\nescape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once—I can’t tell\nyou why, I don’t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then\nabout that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!”\nKaterina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger.\n“As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman,\nhe instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved\nDmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an\nexplanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think\nthat such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I\nmyself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I\nloved no one but him! It was only resentment against that creature that\nmade me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you came, he\nbrought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if anything\nhappened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the\nenvelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or\nwas taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone. Then he left me\nmoney, nearly ten thousand—those notes to which the prosecutor referred\nin his speech, having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be\nchanged. I was tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch\nhad not given up his idea of saving his brother, and was confiding this\nplan of escape to me, though he was still jealous of me and still\nconvinced that I loved Mitya. Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot\nunderstand the greatness of such self‐sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I\nwanted to fall at his feet in reverence, but I thought at once that he\nwould take it only for my joy at the thought of Mitya’s being saved\n(and he certainly would have imagined that!), and I was so exasperated\nat the mere possibility of such an unjust thought on his part that I\nlost my temper again, and instead of kissing his feet, flew into a fury\nagain! Oh, I am unhappy! It’s my character, my awful, unhappy\ncharacter! Oh, you will see, I shall end by driving him, too, to\nabandon me for another with whom he can get on better, like Dmitri. But\n... no, I could not bear it, I should kill myself. And when you came in\nthen, and when I called to you and told him to come back, I was so\nenraged by the look of contempt and hatred he turned on me that—do you\nremember?—I cried out to you that it was he, he alone who had persuaded\nme that his brother Dmitri was a murderer! I said that malicious thing\non purpose to wound him again. He had never, never persuaded me that\nhis brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I who persuaded\nhim! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved the way to\nthat hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an\nhonorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin\nhim for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause\nof it all, I alone am to blame!”",
            "3": "Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt\nthat she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the\nproudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by\ngrief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery,\nthough she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since\nthe trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if\nshe had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was\nsuffering for her “treachery” at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her\nconscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha,\nwith tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor. But he\ndreaded that moment and longed to spare her. It made the commission on\nwhich he had come even more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again.\n\n“It’s all right, it’s all right, don’t be anxious about him!” she began\nagain, sharply and stubbornly. “All that is only momentary, I know him,\nI know his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to\nescape. It’s not as though it would be immediately; he will have time\nto make up his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time\nand will manage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with\nit. Don’t be anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed\nalready: do you suppose he would give up that creature? And they won’t\nlet her go to him, so he is bound to escape. It’s you he’s most afraid\nof, he is afraid you won’t approve of his escape on moral grounds. But\nyou must generously _allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,”\nKatya added viciously. She paused and smiled.\n\n“He talks about some hymn,” she went on again, “some cross he has to\nbear, some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal\nabout it, and if you knew how he talked!” Katya cried suddenly, with\nfeeling she could not repress, “if you knew how he loved that wretched\nman at the moment he told me, and how he hated him, perhaps, at the\nsame moment. And I heard his story and his tears with sneering disdain.\nBrute! Yes, I am a brute. I am responsible for his fever. But that man\nin prison is incapable of suffering,” Katya concluded irritably. “Can\nsuch a man suffer? Men like him never suffer!”",
            "4": "There was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words. And\nyet it was she who had betrayed him. “Perhaps because she feels how\nshe’s wronged him she hates him at moments,” Alyosha thought to\nhimself. He hoped that it was only “at moments.” In Katya’s last words\nhe detected a challenging note, but he did not take it up.\n\n“I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him\nyourself. Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be\ndishonorable, cowardly, or something ... unchristian, perhaps?” Katya\nadded, even more defiantly.\n\n“Oh, no. I’ll tell him everything,” muttered Alyosha. “He asks you to\ncome and see him to‐day,” he blurted out suddenly, looking her steadily\nin the face. She started, and drew back a little from him on the sofa.\n\n“Me? Can that be?” she faltered, turning pale.\n\n“It can and ought to be!” Alyosha began emphatically, growing more\nanimated. “He needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened\nthe subject and worried you, if it were not necessary. He is ill, he is\nbeside himself, he keeps asking for you. It is not to be reconciled\nwith you that he wants you, but only that you would go and show\nyourself at his door. So much has happened to him since that day. He\nrealizes that he has injured you beyond all reckoning. He does not ask\nyour forgiveness—‘It’s impossible to forgive me,’ he says himself—but\nonly that you would show yourself in his doorway.”\n\n“It’s so sudden....” faltered Katya. “I’ve had a presentiment all these\ndays that you would come with that message. I knew he would ask me to\ncome. It’s impossible!”\n\n“Let it be impossible, but do it. Only think, he realizes for the first\ntime how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never\ngrasped it before so fully. He said, ‘If she refuses to come I shall be\nunhappy all my life.’ Do you hear? though he is condemned to penal\nservitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy—is not\nthat piteous? Think—you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is\ninnocent,” broke like a challenge from Alyosha. “His hands are clean,\nthere is no blood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in\nthe future visit him now. Go, greet him on his way into the\ndarkness—stand at his door, that is all.... You ought to do it, you\nought to!” Alyosha concluded, laying immense stress on the word\n“ought.”\n\n“I ought to ... but I cannot....” Katya moaned. “He will look at me....\nI can’t.”",
            "5": "“Your eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you don’t\nmake up your mind to do it now?”\n\n“Better suffer all my life.”\n\n“You ought to go, you ought to go,” Alyosha repeated with merciless\nemphasis.\n\n“But why to‐day, why at once?... I can’t leave our patient—”\n\n“You can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don’t come, he\nwill be in delirium by to‐night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity\non him!”\n\n“Have pity on _me!_” Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst\ninto tears.\n\n“Then you will come,” said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. “I’ll go\nand tell him you will come directly.”\n\n“No, don’t tell him so on any account,” cried Katya in alarm. “I will\ncome, but don’t tell him beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not go\nin.... I don’t know yet—”\n\nHer voice failed her. She gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go.\n\n“And what if I meet any one?” she said suddenly, in a low voice,\nturning white again.\n\n“That’s just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one. There will\nbe no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,”\nhe concluded emphatically, and went out of the room."

            "0": "He hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The day after his\nfate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was\nsent to the prison division of the town hospital. But at the request of\nseveral persons (Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.), Doctor\nVarvinsky had put Mitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate\nlittle room, the one where Smerdyakov had been. It is true that there\nwas a sentinel at the other end of the corridor, and there was a\ngrating over the window, so that Varvinsky could be at ease about the\nindulgence he had shown, which was not quite legal, indeed; but he was\na kind‐hearted and compassionate young man. He knew how hard it would\nbe for a man like Mitya to pass at once so suddenly into the society of\nrobbers and murderers, and that he must get used to it by degrees. The\nvisits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by the\ndoctor and overseer, and even by the police captain. But only Alyosha\nand Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had tried to force his way in\ntwice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky not to admit him.\n\nAlyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing‐gown,\nrather feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his\nhead. He looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression,\nbut there was a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had\nbecome terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be\nsilent for half an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something\nheavily and painfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused\nhimself from his brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a\nkind of abruptness and never of what he really wanted to say. He looked\nsometimes with a face of suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more\nat ease with Grushenka than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke\nto her at all, but as soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up\nwith joy.\n\nAlyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was\nwaiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a\nquestion. He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to\ncome, and at the same time he felt that if she did not come, something\ninconceivable would happen. Alyosha understood his feelings.",
            "1": "“Trifon Borissovitch,” Mitya began nervously, “has pulled his whole inn\nto pieces, I am told. He’s taken up the flooring, pulled apart the\nplanks, split up all the gallery, I am told. He is seeking treasure all\nthe time—the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said I’d\nhidden there. He began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he\ngot home. Serve him right, the swindler! The guard here told me\nyesterday; he comes from there.”\n\n“Listen,” began Alyosha. “She will come, but I don’t know when. Perhaps\nto‐day, perhaps in a few days, that I can’t tell. But she will come,\nshe will, that’s certain.”\n\nMitya started, would have said something, but was silent. The news had\na tremendous effect on him. It was evident that he would have liked\nterribly to know what had been said, but he was again afraid to ask.\nSomething cruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him like a\nknife at that moment.\n\n“This was what she said among other things; that I must be sure to set\nyour conscience at rest about escaping. If Ivan is not well by then she\nwill see to it all herself.”\n\n“You’ve spoken of that already,” Mitya observed musingly.\n\n“And you have repeated it to Grusha,” observed Alyosha.\n\n“Yes,” Mitya admitted. “She won’t come this morning.” He looked timidly\nat his brother. “She won’t come till the evening. When I told her\nyesterday that Katya was taking measures, she was silent, but she set\nher mouth. She only whispered, ‘Let her!’ She understood that it was\nimportant. I did not dare to try her further. She understands now, I\nthink, that Katya no longer cares for me, but loves Ivan.”\n\n“Does she?” broke from Alyosha.\n\n“Perhaps she does not. Only she is not coming this morning,” Mitya\nhastened to explain again; “I asked her to do something for me. You\nknow, Ivan is superior to all of us. He ought to live, not us. He will\nrecover.”\n\n“Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him, she scarcely\ndoubts of his recovery,” said Alyosha.\n\n“That means that she is convinced he will die. It’s because she is\nfrightened she’s so sure he will get well.”\n\n“Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there’s every hope\nthat he will get well,” Alyosha observed anxiously.\n\n“Yes, he will get well. But she is convinced that he will die. She has\na great deal of sorrow to bear...” A silence followed. A grave anxiety\nwas fretting Mitya.\n\n“Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,” he said suddenly in a shaking voice,\nfull of tears.",
            "2": "“They won’t let her go out there to you,” Alyosha put in at once.\n\n“And there is something else I wanted to tell you,” Mitya went on, with\na sudden ring in his voice. “If they beat me on the way or out there, I\nwon’t submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it.\nAnd this will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as\nit is. I’ve been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself. I am\nnot ready! I am not able to resign myself. I wanted to sing a ‘hymn’;\nbut if a guard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it.\nFor Grusha I would bear anything ... anything except blows.... But she\nwon’t be allowed to come there.”\n\nAlyosha smiled gently.\n\n“Listen, brother, once for all,” he said. “This is what I think about\nit. And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not\nready, and such a cross is not for you. What’s more, you don’t need\nsuch a martyr’s cross when you are not ready for it. If you had\nmurdered our father, it would grieve me that you should reject your\npunishment. But you are innocent, and such a cross is too much for you.\nYou wanted to make yourself another man by suffering. I say, only\nremember that other man always, all your life and wherever you go; and\nthat will be enough for you. Your refusal of that great cross will only\nserve to make you feel all your life an even greater duty, and that\nconstant feeling will do more to make you a new man, perhaps, than if\nyou went there. For there you would not endure it and would repine, and\nperhaps at last would say: ‘I am quits.’ The lawyer was right about\nthat. Such heavy burdens are not for all men. For some they are\nimpossible. These are my thoughts about it, if you want them so much.\nIf other men would have to answer for your escape, officers or\nsoldiers, then I would not have ‘allowed’ you,” smiled Alyosha. “But\nthey declare—the superintendent of that _étape_ told Ivan himself—that\nif it’s well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that they can\nget off easily. Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a case,\nbut I can’t undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya\ncommissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes. I\nmust tell you the truth. And so I can’t judge of your own action. But\nlet me assure you that I shall never condemn you. And it would be a\nstrange thing if I could judge you in this. Now I think I’ve gone into\neverything.”",
            "3": "“But I do condemn myself!” cried Mitya. “I shall escape, that was\nsettled apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away?\nBut I shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That’s\nhow the Jesuits talk, isn’t it? Just as we are doing?”\n\n“Yes.” Alyosha smiled gently.",
            "4": "“I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding\nanything,” cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh. “So I’ve caught my Alyosha\nbeing Jesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest;\nI’ll open the other side of my heart to you. This is what I planned and\ndecided. If I run away, even with money and a passport, and even to\nAmerica, I should be cheered up by the thought that I am not running\naway for pleasure, not for happiness, but to another exile as bad,\nperhaps, as Siberia. It is as bad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America,\ndamn it, already. Even though Grusha will be with me. Just look at her;\nis she an American? She is Russian, Russian to the marrow of her bones;\nshe will be homesick for the mother country, and I shall see every hour\nthat she is suffering for my sake, that she has taken up that cross for\nme. And what harm has she done? And how shall I, too, put up with the\nrabble out there, though they may be better than I, every one of them?\nI hate that America already! And though they may be wonderful at\nmachinery, every one of them, damn them, they are not of my soul. I\nlove Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I am a scoundrel\nmyself. I shall choke there!” he exclaimed, his eyes suddenly flashing.\nHis voice was trembling with tears. “So this is what I’ve decided,\nAlyosha, listen,” he began again, mastering his emotion. “As soon as I\narrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on the land, in\nsolitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears. There must be some\nremote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there,\nsomewhere, on the edge of the horizon. So to the country of the _Last\nof the Mohicans_, and there we’ll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha\nand I. Work and grammar—that’s how we’ll spend three years. And by that\ntime we shall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we’ve\nlearnt it—good‐by to America! We’ll run here to Russia as American\ncitizens. Don’t be uneasy—we would not come to this little town. We’d\nhide somewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south. I shall\nbe changed by that time, and she will, too, in America. The doctors\nshall make me some sort of wart on my face—what’s the use of their\nbeing so mechanical!—or else I’ll put out one eye, let my beard grow a\nyard, and I shall turn gray, fretting for Russia. I dare say they won’t\nrecognize us. And if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I don’t\ncare. It will show it’s our fate. We’ll work on the land here, too,\nsomewhere in the wilds, and I’ll make up as an American all my life.\nBut we shall die on our own soil. That’s my plan, and it shan’t be\naltered. Do you approve?”",
            "5": "“Yes,” said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for a\nminute and said suddenly:\n\n“And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn’t they work it up!”\n\n“If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,” said\nAlyosha, with a sigh.\n\n“Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it’s hard,” Mitya\nmoaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.\n\n“Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!” he exclaimed suddenly.\n“Tell me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did\nshe say it?”\n\n“She said she would come, but I don’t know whether she will come\nto‐day. It’s hard for her, you know,” Alyosha looked timidly at his\nbrother.\n\n“I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of my\nmind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my\nheart: what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want?\nIt’s the headstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for\nsuffering. I am a scoundrel, that’s all one can say.”\n\n“Here she is!” cried Alyosha.\n\nAt that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood\nstill, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt impulsively to\nhis feet, and a scared look came into his face. He turned pale, but a\ntimid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once, and with an\nirresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya. Seeing it, she\nflew impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands, and almost by\nforce made him sit down on the bed. She sat down beside him, and still\nkeeping his hands pressed them violently. Several times they both\nstrove to speak, but stopped short and again gazed speechless with a\nstrange smile, their eyes fastened on one another. So passed two\nminutes.\n\n“Have you forgiven me?” Mitya faltered at last, and at the same moment\nturning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried, “Do you hear\nwhat I am asking, do you hear?”",
            "6": "“That’s what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!” broke\nfrom Katya. “My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether\nyou forgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and\nI in yours—so it must be....” She stopped to take breath. “What have I\ncome for?” she began again with nervous haste: “to embrace your feet,\nto press your hands like this, till it hurts—you remember how in Moscow\nI used to squeeze them—to tell you again that you are my god, my joy,\nto tell you that I love you madly,” she moaned in anguish, and suddenly\npressed his hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes.\nAlyosha stood speechless and confounded; he had never expected what he\nwas seeing.\n\n“Love is over, Mitya!” Katya began again, “but the past is painfully\ndear to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might\nhave been come true for one minute,” she faltered, with a drawn smile,\nlooking into his face joyfully again. “You love another woman, and I\nlove another man, and yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love\nme; do you know that? Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life!” she\ncried, with a quiver almost of menace in her voice.\n\n“I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,” Mitya began, drawing a\ndeep breath at each word, “do you know, five days ago, that same\nevening, I loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ...\nAll my life! So it will be, so it will always be—”\n\nSo they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless,\nperhaps not even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they\nboth believed what they said implicitly.\n\n“Katya,” cried Mitya suddenly, “do you believe I murdered him? I know\nyou don’t believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence....\nSurely, surely you did not believe it!”\n\n“I did not believe it even then. I’ve never believed it. I hated you,\nand for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I\npersuaded myself and believed it, but when I’d finished speaking I left\noff believing it at once. Don’t doubt that! I have forgotten that I\ncame here to punish myself,” she said, with a new expression in her\nvoice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before.\n\n“Woman, yours is a heavy burden,” broke, as it were, involuntarily from\nMitya.\n\n“Let me go,” she whispered. “I’ll come again. It’s more than I can bear\nnow.”",
            "7": "She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream\nand staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the\nroom. No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but\nwhen she reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as\nchalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper:\n\n“Forgive me!”\n\nGrushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,\nvenomous voice, answered:\n\n“We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred!\nAs though we could forgive one another! Save him, and I’ll worship you\nall my life.”\n\n“You won’t forgive her!” cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.\n\n“Don’t be anxious, I’ll save him for you!” Katya whispered rapidly, and\nshe ran out of the room.\n\n“And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness\nherself?” Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.\n\n“Mitya, don’t dare to blame her; you have no right to!” Alyosha cried\nhotly.\n\n“Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,” Grushenka brought out in a tone\nof disgust. “If she saves you I’ll forgive her everything—”\n\nShe stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not\nyet recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards,\naccidentally, with no suspicion of what she would meet.\n\n“Alyosha, run after her!” Mitya cried to his brother; “tell her ... I\ndon’t know ... don’t let her go away like this!”\n\n“I’ll come to you again at nightfall,” said Alyosha, and he ran after\nKatya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking\nfast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly:\n\n“No, before that woman I can’t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness\nbecause I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not\nforgive me.... I like her for that!” she added, in an unnatural voice,\nand her eyes flashed with fierce resentment.\n\n“My brother did not expect this in the least,” muttered Alyosha. “He\nwas sure she would not come—”\n\n“No doubt. Let us leave that,” she snapped. “Listen: I can’t go with\nyou to the funeral now. I’ve sent them flowers. I think they still have\nmoney. If necessary, tell them I’ll never abandon them.... Now leave\nme, leave me, please. You are late as it is—the bells are ringing for\nthe service.... Leave me, please!”"

            "0": "He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to\nbear the pretty flower‐decked little coffin to the church without him.\nIt was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after\nMitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the\nshouts of the boys, Ilusha’s schoolfellows. They had all been\nimpatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last. There\nwere about twelve of them, they all had their school‐bags or satchels\non their shoulders. “Father will cry, be with father,” Ilusha had told\nthem as he lay dying, and the boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was\nthe foremost of them.\n\n“How glad I am you’ve come, Karamazov!” he cried, holding out his hand\nto Alyosha. “It’s awful here. It’s really horrible to see it. Snegiryov\nis not drunk, we know for a fact he’s had nothing to drink to‐day, but\nhe seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful.\nKaramazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?”\n\n“What is it, Kolya?” said Alyosha.\n\n“Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or\nwas it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven’t slept for the\nlast four nights for thinking of it.”\n\n“The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,” answered Alyosha.\n\n“That’s what I said,” cried Smurov.\n\n“So he will perish an innocent victim!” exclaimed Kolya; “though he is\nruined he is happy! I could envy him!”\n\n“What do you mean? How can you? Why?” cried Alyosha surprised.\n\n“Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!” said Kolya\nwith enthusiasm.\n\n“But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!” said\nAlyosha.\n\n“Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for\ndisgrace, I don’t care about that—our names may perish. I respect your\nbrother!”\n\n“And so do I!” the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had\nfounded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his\nears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.",
            "1": "Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded and his\neyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His thin face\nwas hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of\ndecay from the corpse. The expression of his face was serious and, as\nit were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his breast, looked\nparticularly beautiful, as though chiseled in marble. There were\nflowers in his hands and the coffin, inside and out, was decked with\nflowers, which had been sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But\nthere were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened\nthe door, the captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and was\nstrewing them again over his dear boy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha\nwhen he came in, and he would not look at any one, even at his crazy\nweeping wife, “mamma,” who kept trying to stand on her crippled legs to\nget a nearer look at her dead boy. Nina had been pushed in her chair by\nthe boys close up to the coffin. She sat with her head pressed to it\nand she too was no doubt quietly weeping. Snegiryov’s face looked\neager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There was something crazy about\nhis gestures and the words that broke from him. “Old man, dear old\nman!” he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his habit to\ncall Ilusha “old man,” as a term of affection when he was alive.\n\n“Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his hand and\ngive it me,” the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either because the\nlittle white rose in Ilusha’s hand had caught her fancy or that she\nwanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him, she moved\nrestlessly, stretching out her hands for the flower.\n\n“I won’t give it to any one, I won’t give you anything,” Snegiryov\ncried callously. “They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is his,\nnothing is yours!”\n\n“Father, give mother a flower!” said Nina, lifting her face wet with\ntears.\n\n“I won’t give away anything and to her less than any one! She didn’t\nlove Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it to her,”\nthe captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given\nup his cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in\nnoiseless tears, hiding her face in her hands.\n\nThe boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that it\nwas time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began to\nlift it up.",
            "2": "“I don’t want him to be buried in the churchyard,” Snegiryov wailed\nsuddenly; “I’ll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha told me to.\nI won’t let him be carried out!”\n\nHe had been saying for the last three days that he would bury him by\nthe stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister and all\nthe boys interfered.\n\n“What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had hanged\nhimself!” the old landlady said sternly. “There in the churchyard the\nground has been crossed. He’ll be prayed for there. One can hear the\nsinging in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it\nwill reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave.”\n\nAt last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, “Take\nhim where you will.” The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed the\nmother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might say\ngood‐ by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little face, which for\nthe last three days she had only looked at from a distance, she\ntrembled all over and her gray head began twitching spasmodically over\nthe coffin.\n\n“Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your blessing,\nkiss him,” Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched like an\nautomaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she began,\nwithout a word, beating her breast with her fist. They carried the\ncoffin past her. Nina pressed her lips to her brother’s for the last\ntime as they bore the coffin by her. As Alyosha went out of the house\nhe begged the landlady to look after those who were left behind, but\nshe interrupted him before he had finished.\n\n“To be sure, I’ll stay with them, we are Christians, too.” The old\nwoman wept as she said it.\n\nThey had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than three\nhundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost. The\nchurch bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted\nafter the coffin, in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare\nand his soft, old, wide‐brimmed hat in his hand. He seemed in a state\nof bewildered anxiety. At one minute he stretched out his hand to\nsupport the head of the coffin and only hindered the bearers, at\nanother he ran alongside and tried to find a place for himself there. A\nflower fell on the snow and he rushed to pick it up as though\neverything in the world depended on the loss of that flower.",
            "3": "“And the crust of bread, we’ve forgotten the crust!” he cried suddenly\nin dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the\ncrust of bread already and that it was in his pocket. He instantly\npulled it out and was reassured.\n\n“Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,” he explained at once to Alyosha. “I was\nsitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: ‘Father, when my\ngrave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows\nmay fly down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying\nalone.’ ”\n\n“That’s a good thing,” said Alyosha, “we must often take some.”\n\n“Every day, every day!” said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at\nthe thought.\n\nThey reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it.\nThe boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all through\nthe service. It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons\nwere without settings; but such churches are the best for praying in.\nDuring the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he\nhad outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent\nanxiety. At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the\ncover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he\nrushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he\nsubsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank\nuneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to\nAlyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been\nread properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer,\n“Like the Cherubim,” he joined in the singing but did not go on to the\nend. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor\nand lay so for a long while.",
            "4": "At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed.\nThe distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and\nimpressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed\nsuddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he\ntried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began\ntaking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms\nabout, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began\ngreedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last\nthey succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step, but\nsuddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few\nflowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a new idea seemed to\ndawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute.\nGradually he seemed to sink into brooding and did not resist when the\ncoffin was lifted up and carried to the grave. It was an expensive one\nin the churchyard close to the church, Katerina Ivanovna had paid for\nit. After the customary rites the grave‐ diggers lowered the coffin.\nSnegiryov with his flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open\ngrave that the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him\nback. He did not seem to understand fully what was happening. When they\nbegan filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed anxiously at the\nfalling earth and began trying to say something, but no one could make\nout what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he was reminded that\nhe must crumble the bread and he was awfully excited, snatched up the\nbread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the morsels on the\ngrave.\n\n“Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!” he muttered anxiously.\n\nOne of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the\nbread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them\nto some one to hold for a time. But he would not do this and seemed\nindeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they wanted to take\nthem from him altogether. And after looking at the grave, and as it\nwere, satisfying himself that everything had been done and the bread\nhad been crumbled, he suddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned,\nquite composedly even, and made his way homewards. But his steps became\nmore and more hurried, he almost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with\nhim.\n\n“The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind to\nmamma,” he began exclaiming suddenly.",
            "5": "Some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he flung\nthe hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating, “I\nwon’t have the hat, I won’t have the hat.” Smurov picked it up and\ncarried it after him. All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy\nwho discovered about Troy most of all. Though Smurov, with the\ncaptain’s hat in his hand, was crying bitterly too, he managed, as he\nran, to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the\npath, to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by. He\nmissed them, of course, and went on crying as he ran. Half‐way,\nSnegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a minute, as though\nstruck by something, and suddenly turning back to the church, ran\ntowards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly overtook him and\ncaught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell helpless on the snow as\nthough he had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing,\nhe began crying out, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man!” Alyosha and Kolya\ntried to make him get up, soothing and persuading him.\n\n“Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,” muttered Kolya.\n\n“You’ll spoil the flowers,” said Alyosha, “and mamma is expecting them,\nshe is sitting crying because you would not give her any before.\nIlusha’s little bed is still there—”\n\n“Yes, yes, mamma!” Snegiryov suddenly recollected, “they’ll take away\nthe bed, they’ll take it away,” he added as though alarmed that they\nreally would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far\noff and they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly\nand called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just\nbefore:\n\n“Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,” he\ncried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been\nfrozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that\ninstant he saw in the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha’s little boots,\nwhich the landlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old,\npatched, rusty‐ looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed\nto them, fell on his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his lips\nto it, began kissing it greedily, crying, “Ilusha, old man, dear old\nman, where are your little feet?”\n\n“Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?” the lunatic\ncried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran\nout of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out.",
            "6": "“Let them weep,” he said to Kolya, “it’s no use trying to comfort them\njust now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.”\n\n“No, it’s no use, it’s awful,” Kolya assented. “Do you know,\nKaramazov,” he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, “I\nfeel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him back,\nI’d give anything in the world to do it.”\n\n“Ah, so would I,” said Alyosha.\n\n“What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to‐night?\nHe’ll be drunk, you know.”\n\n“Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough,\nto spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come\ntogether we shall remind them of everything again,” Alyosha suggested.\n\n“The landlady is laying the table for them now—there’ll be a funeral\ndinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it,\nKaramazov?”\n\n“Of course,” said Alyosha.\n\n“It’s all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after\nit, it all seems so unnatural in our religion.”\n\n“They are going to have salmon, too,” the boy who had discovered about\nTroy observed in a loud voice.\n\n“I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your\nidiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn’t\ncare to know whether you exist or not!” Kolya snapped out irritably.\nThe boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply.\n\nMeantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov\nexclaimed:\n\n“There’s Ilusha’s stone, under which they wanted to bury him.”\n\nThey all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the whole\npicture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha,\nweeping and hugging his father, had cried, “Father, father, how he\ninsulted you,” rose at once before his imagination.\n\nA sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul. With a serious and\nearnest expression he looked from one to another of the bright,\npleasant faces of Ilusha’s schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them:\n\n“Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.”\n\nThe boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes\nupon him.",
            "7": "“Boys, we shall soon part. I shall be for some time with my two\nbrothers, of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at\ndeath’s door. But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long\ntime, so we shall part. Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha’s stone,\nthat we will never forget Ilusha and one another. And whatever happens\nto us later in life, if we don’t meet for twenty years afterwards, let\nus always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw\nstones, do you remember, by the bridge? and afterwards we all grew so\nfond of him. He was a fine boy, a kind‐hearted, brave boy, he felt for\nhis father’s honor and resented the cruel insult to him and stood up\nfor him. And so in the first place, we will remember him, boys, all our\nlives. And even if we are occupied with most important things, if we\nattain to honor or fall into great misfortune—still let us remember how\ngood it was once here, when we were all together, united by a good and\nkind feeling which made us, for the time we were loving that poor boy,\nbetter perhaps than we are. My little doves—let me call you so, for you\nare very like them, those pretty blue birds, at this minute as I look\nat your good dear faces. My dear children, perhaps you won’t understand\nwhat I am saying to you, because I often speak very unintelligibly, but\nyou’ll remember it all the same and will agree with my words some time.\nYou must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more\nwholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory,\nespecially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you a great\ndeal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from\nchildhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many such\nmemories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days, and if\none has only one good memory left in one’s heart, even that may\nsometime be the means of saving us. Perhaps we may even grow wicked\nlater on, may be unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at\nmen’s tears and at those people who say as Kolya did just now, ‘I want\nto suffer for all men,’ and may even jeer spitefully at such people.\nBut however bad we may become—which God forbid—yet, when we recall how\nwe buried Ilusha, how we loved him in his last days, and how we have\nbeen talking like friends all together, at this stone, the cruelest and\nmost mocking of us—if we do become so—will not dare to laugh inwardly\nat having been kind and good at this moment! What’s more, perhaps, that\none memory may keep him from great evil and he will reflect and say,\n‘Yes, I was good and brave and honest then!’ Let him laugh to himself,\nthat’s no matter, a man often laughs at what’s good and kind. That’s\nonly from thoughtlessness. But I assure you, boys, that as he laughs he\nwill say at once in his heart, ‘No, I do wrong to laugh, for that’s not\na thing to laugh at.’ ”",
            "8": "“That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!” cried Kolya, with\nflashing eyes.\n\nThe boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but they\nrestrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the\nspeaker.\n\n“I say this in case we become bad,” Alyosha went on, “but there’s no\nreason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be, first and\nabove all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other! I\nsay that again. I give you my word for my part that I’ll never forget\none of you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for\nthirty years. Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to\nknow whether he exists or not. But I cannot forget that Kartashov\nexists and that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the\nfounders of Troy, but is looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear\nlittle eyes. Boys, my dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like\nIlusha, clever, brave and generous like Kolya (though he will be ever\nso much cleverer when he is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as\nclever and sweet as Kartashov. But why am I talking about those two?\nYou are all dear to me, boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my\nheart for you all, and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me!\nWell, and who has united us in this kind, good feeling which we shall\nremember and intend to remember all our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, the\ngood boy, the dear boy, precious to us for ever! Let us never forget\nhim. May his memory live for ever in our hearts from this time forth!”\n\n“Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!” the boys cried in their ringing voices,\nwith softened faces.\n\n“Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots,\nhis coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he stood up\nfor him alone against the whole school.”\n\n“We will remember, we will remember,” cried the boys. “He was brave, he\nwas good!”\n\n“Ah, how I loved him!” exclaimed Kolya.\n\n“Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don’t be afraid of life! How good life\nis when one does something good and just!”\n\n“Yes, yes,” the boys repeated enthusiastically.\n\n“Karamazov, we love you!” a voice, probably Kartashov’s, cried\nimpulsively.\n\n“We love you, we love you!” they all caught it up. There were tears in\nthe eyes of many of them.\n\n“Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya shouted ecstatically.\n\n“And may the dead boy’s memory live for ever!” Alyosha added again with\nfeeling.\n\n“For ever!” the boys chimed in again.",
            "9": "“Karamazov,” cried Kolya, “can it be true what’s taught us in religion,\nthat we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each\nother again, all, Ilusha too?”\n\n“Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other\nand shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!”\nAlyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.\n\n“Ah, how splendid it will be!” broke from Kolya.\n\n“Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner. Don’t\nbe put out at our eating pancakes—it’s a very old custom and there’s\nsomething nice in that!” laughed Alyosha. “Well, let us go! And now we\ngo hand in hand.”\n\n“And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!”\nKolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up his\nexclamation: “Hurrah for Karamazov!”"
