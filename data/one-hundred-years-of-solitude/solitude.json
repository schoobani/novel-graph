            "0": "MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colone l Aureliano \nBuendía was to remember that distant afternoon when h is father took him to \ndiscover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twen ty adobe houses, built on \nthe bank of a river of clear water that ran along a b ed of polished stones, which \nwere white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The worl d was so recent that \nmany things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to \npoint. Every year during the month of March a family of  ragged gypsies would set \nup their tents near the village, and with a great up roar of pipes and kettledrums \nthey would display new inventions. First they brought the  magnet. A heavy gypsy \nwith an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduce d himself as \nMelquíades, put on a bold public demonstration of what  he himself called the \neighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia. H e went from house to \nhouse dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed  to see pots, pans, \ntongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the \ndesperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even  objects that had been \nlost for a long time appeared from where they had bee n searched for most and \nwent dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Me lquíades’ magical irons. \n“Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent. “It’s \nsimply a matter of waking up their souls.” José Arcadio Bue ndía, w hose  \nunbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond \nmiracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to  make use of that useless \ninvention to extract gold from the bowels of the eart h. Melquíades, who was an \nhonest man, warned him: “It won’t work for that.” But  José Arcadio Buendía at \nthat time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a \npair of goats for the two magnetized ingots. Úrsula I guarán, his wife, who relied \non those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings,  was unable to",
            "1": "dissuade him. “Very soon well have gold enough and mor e to pave the floors of \nthe house,” her husband replied. For several months he worked hard to \ndemonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every i nch of the region, even the \nriverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reci ting Melquíades’ incantation \naloud. The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unea rth a suit of fifteenth-\ncentury armor which had all of its pieces soldered toget her with rust and inside of \nwhich there was the hollow resonance of an enormous ston e-filled gourd. When \nJosé Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition  managed to take the \narmor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with  a copper locket containing \na woman’s hair around its neck. \nIn March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a \nmagnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited  as the latest discovery \nof the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village \nand set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the price of five reales, \npeople could look into the telescope and see the gypsy wom an an arm’s length \naway. “Science has eliminated distance,” Melquíades proclai med. “In a short \ntime, man will be able to see what is happening in an y place in the world without \nleaving his own house.” A burning noonday sun brought out a startling \ndemonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they p ut a pile of dry hay in the \nmiddle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating  the sun’s rays. José \nArcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for t he failure of big magnets, \nconceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war. Again Melquíades \ntried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two m agnetized ingots and three \ncolonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Úrsu la wept in consternation. \nThat money was from a chest of gold coins that her fathe r had put together ova \nan entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of \na proper occasion to make use of it. José Arcadio Buendía m ade no at. tempt to \nconsole her, completely absorbed in his tactical experiment s with the abnegation",
            "2": "of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life. In a n attempt to show the effects \nof the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the \nsun’s rays and suffered burns which turned into sores th at took a long time to \nheal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at  s u c h  a  d a n g e r o u s  \ninvention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire. He would spend \nhours on end in his room, calculating the strategic possib ilities of his novel \nweapon until he succeeded in putting together a manua l of startling instructional \nclarity and an irresistible power of conviction. He sent i t to the government, \naccompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of \nexplanatory sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains,  got lost in \nmeasureless swamps, forded stormy rivers, and was on the poin t of perishing \nunder the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts unt il he found a route that \njoined the one used by the mules that carried the mail.  In spite of the fact that a \ntrip to the capital was little less than impossible at t hat time, José Arcadio \nBuendía promised to undertake it as soon as the governme nt ordered him to so \nthat he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military \nauthorities and could train them himself in the complica ted art of solar war. For \nseveral years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of  waiting, he bemoaned to \nMelquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing \nproof of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in  e x c h a n g e  f o r  t h e  \nmagnifying glass, and he left him in addition some Port uguese maps and several \ninstruments of navigation. In his own handwriting he se t down a concise \nsynthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann. which he left José Arcadio so that he \nwould be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. José \nArcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season  shut up in a small \nroom that he had built in the rear of the house so th at no one would disturb his \nexperiments. Having completely abandoned his domestic obli gations, he spent \nentire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the  stars and he almost",
            "3": "contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact meth od to ascertain noon. \nWhen he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he \nconceived a notion of space that allowed him to navigat e across unknown seas, \nto visit uninhabited territories, and to establish rela tions with splendid beings \nwithout having to leave his study. That was the period i n which he acquired the \nhabit of talking to himself, of walking through the ho use without paying attention \nto anyone, as Úrsula and the children broke their backs i n the garden, growing \nbanana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eg gplants. \nSuddenly, without warning, his feverish activity was int errupted and was replaced \nby a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he we re bewitched, softly \nrepeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures wit hout giving credit to his own \nunderstanding. Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunc htime, all at once he \nreleased the whole weight of his torment. The childre n would remember for the \nrest of their lives the august solemnity with which thei r father, devastated by his \nprolonged vigil and by the wrath of his imagination, revealed his discovery to \nthem: \n“The earth is round, like an orange.” \nÚrsula lost her patience. “If you have to go crazy, please  go crazy all by \nyourself!” she shouted. “But don’t try to put your gypsy id eas into the heads of the \nchildren.” José Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let h imself be frightened by \nthe desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage,  mashed the astrolabe \nagainst the floor. He built another one, he gathered  the men of the village in his \nlittle room, and he demonstrated to them, with theor ies that none of them could \nunderstand, the possibility of returning to where one h ad set out by consistently \nsailing east. The whole village was convinced that José Arca dio Buendía had lost \nhis reason, when Melquíades returned to set things strai ght. He gave public \npraise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astr onomical speculation had \nevolved a theory that had already been proved in pract ice, although unknown in",
            "4": "Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was \nto have a profound influence on the future of the vil lage: the laboratory of an \nalchemist. \nBy then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity . On his first trips he \nseemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But wh ile the latter had \npreserved his extraordinary strength, which permitted h im to pull down a horse by \ngrabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dow se by some \ntenacious illness. It was, in reality, the result of multi ple and rare diseases \ncontracted on his innumerable trips around the world. A ccording to what he \nhimself said as he spoke to José Arcadio Buendía while help ing him set up the \nlaboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing a t the cuffs of his pants, but \nnever deciding to give him the final clutch of its cla ws. He was a fugitive from all \nthe plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankin d. He had survived \npellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, \nberiberi in Japan, bubonic plague in Madagascar, an ea rthquake in Sicily, and a \ndisastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. That pro digious creature, said to \npossess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped i n a sad aura, \nwith an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of \nthings. He wore a large black hat that looked like a ra ven with widespread wings, \nand a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuri es had skated. But in spite \nof his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a  human burden, an \nearthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life. He \nwould complain of the ailments of old age, he suffer ed from the most insignificant \neconomic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a lon g time back because \nscurvy had made his teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the \ngypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certa inty that it was \nthe beginning of a great friendship. The children w ere startled by his fantastic \nstories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would",
            "5": "remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him th at afternoon, sitting against \nthe metallic and quivering light from the window, li ghting up with his deep organ \nvoice the darkest reaches of the imagination, while dow n over his temples there \nflowed the grease that was being melted by the heat. Jo sé Arcadio, his older \nbrother, would pass on that wonderful image as a here ditary memory to all of his \ndescendants. Úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memor y of that visit, for she \nhad entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly bro ken a flask of \nbichloride of mercury. \n“It’s the smell of the devil,” she said. \n“Not at all,” Melquíades corrected her. “It has been p roven that the devil has \nsulphuric properties and this is just a little corrosive su blimate.” \nAlways didactic, he went into a learned exposition of th e diabolical properties \nof cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him, alt hough she took the children off \nto pray. That biting odor would stay forever in her mi nd linked to the memory of \nMelquíades. \nThe rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion o f pots, funnels, \nretorts, filters, and sieves—was made up of a primitive  water pipe, a glass beaker \nwith a long, thin neck, a reproduction of the philosoph er’s egg, and a still the \ngypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern descri ptions of the \nthree-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along with those i tems, Melquíades left \nsamples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the \nformulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity o f gold, and a set of \nnotes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teachi ng that would \npermit those who could interpret them to undertake the  manufacture of the \nphilosopher’s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the form ulas to double the \nquantity of gold, José Arcadio Buendía paid court to Úrsu la for several weeks so \nthat she would let him dig up her colonial coins and in crease them by as many \ntimes as it was possible to subdivide mercury. Úrsula gav e in, as always, to her",
            "6": "husband’s unyielding obstinacy. Then José Arcadio Buendía t hrew three \ndoubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filin gs, orpiment, brimstone, \nand lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oi l until he got a thick and \npestilential syrup which was more like common caramel tha n valuable gold. In \nrisky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with t he seven planetary \nmetals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cypru s, and put back to cook \nin hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Úrsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to \na large piece of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck t o the bottom of the \npot. \nWhen the gypsies came back, Úrsula had turned the whole population of the \nvillage against them. But curiosity was greater than f ear, for that time the gypsies \nwent about the town making a deafening noise with al l manner of musical \ninstruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of t he most fabulous \ndiscovery of the Naciancenes. So that everyone went to the  tent and by paying \none cent they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovered, unwr inkled, with a new and \nflashing set of teeth. Those who remembered his gums tha t had been destroyed \nby scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips trembled  with fear at the final \nproof of the gypsy’s supernatural power. The fear turned  into panic when \nMelquíades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their g ums, and showed them to \nthe audience for an instant—a fleeting instant in which  he went back to being the \nsame decrepit man of years past—and put them back again an d smiled once \nmore with the full control of his restored youth. Even Jo sé Arcadio Buendía \nhimself considered that Melquíades’ knowledge had reac hed unbearable \nextremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the g ypsy explained to him atone \nthe workings of his false teeth. It seemed so simple and so  p r o di g i ou s a t  t h e \nsame time that overnight he lost all interest in his ex periments in alchemy. He \nunderwent a new crisis of bad humor. He did not go ba ck to eating regularly, and \nhe would spend the day walking through the house. “Incre dible things are",
            "7": "happening in the world,” he said to Úrsula. “Right t here across the river there are \nall kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living l ike donkeys.” Those who \nhad known him since the foundation of Macondo were star tled at how much he \nhad changed under Melquíades’ influence. \nAt first José Arcadio Buendía had been a kind of youthful  patriarch who \nwould give instructions for planting and advice for the raising of children and \nanimals, and who collaborated with everyone, even in t he physical work, for the \nwelfare of the community. Since his house from the very f irst had been the best in \nthe village, the others had been built in its image an d likeness. It had a small, \nwell-lighted living room, a dining room in the shape  of a terrace with gaily colored \nflowers, two bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestn ut tree, a well kept \ngarden, and a corral where goats, pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. \nThe only animals that were prohibited, not just in his house but in the entire \nsettlement, were fighting cocks. \nÚrsula’s capacity for work was the same as that of her husb and. Active, \nsmall, severe, that woman of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in her life \nhad been heard to sing seemed to be everywhere, from d awn until quite late at \nnight, always pursued by the soft whispering of her stiff , starched petticoats. \nThanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitew ashed mud walls, the \nrustic, wooden furniture they had built themselves wer e always dean, and the old \nchests where they kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil. \nJosé Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen \nin the village, had set up the placement of the houses i n such a way that from all \nof them one could reach the river and draw water wi th the same effort, and he \nhad lined up the streets with such good sense that no h ouse got more sun than \nanother during the hot time of day. Within a few year s Macondo was a village that \nwas more orderly and hard working than any known until  then by its three",
            "8": "hundred inhabitants. It was a truly happy village where  no one was over thirty \nyears of age and where no one had died. \nSince the time of its founding, José Arcadio Buendía ha d built traps and \ncages. In a short time he filled not only his own house  but all of those in the \nvillage with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and redbr easts. The concert of so \nmany different birds became so disturbing that Úrsula w ould plug her ears with \nbeeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality. The first t ime that Melquíades’ \ntribe arrived, selling glass balls for headaches, everyon e was surprised that they \nhad been able to find that village lost in the drowsi ness of the swamp, and the \ngypsies confessed that they had found their way by the song o f the birds. \nThat spirit of social initiative disappeared in a sho rt time, pulled away by the \nfever of the magnets, the astronomical calculations, the  dreams of transmutation, \nand the urge to discover the wonders of the world. Fro m a clean and active man, \nJosé Arcadio Buendía changed into a man lazy in appea rance, careless in his \ndress, with a wild beard that Úrsula managed to trim with great effort and a \nkitchen knife. There were many who considered him the v ictim of some strange \nspell. But even those most convinced of his madness left wor k and family to \nfollow him when he brought out his tools to clear the land and asked the \nassembled group to open a way that would put Macondo in  contact with the great \ninventions. \nJosé Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the geogr aphy of the \nregion. He knew that to the east there lay an impenet rable mountain chain and \nthat on the other side of the mountains there was the ardent city of Riohacha, \nwhere in times past—according to what he had been told b y the first Aureliano \nBuendía, his grandfather—Sir Francis Drake had gone crocod ile hunting with \ncannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with  straw to bring to Queen \nElizabeth. In his youth, José Arcadio Buendía and his men , with wives and \nchildren, animals and all kinds of domestic implements, h ad crossed the",
            "9": "mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months they \ngave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they wo uld not have to go \nback. It was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to \nthe past. To the south lay the swamps, covered with an e ternal vegetable scum \nand the whole vast universe of the great swamp, which, according to what the \ngypsies said, had no limits. The great swamp in the west m ingled with a \nboundless extension of water where there were soft-skinn ed cetaceans that had \nthe head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of \ntheir extraordinary breasts. The gypsies sailed along tha t route for six months \nbefore they reached the strip of land over which the m ules that carried the mail \npassed. According to José Arcadio Buendía’s calculations, the  only possibility of \ncontact with civilization lay along the northern route.  So he handed out clearing \ntools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been  with him during the \nfounding of Macondo. He threw his directional instrumen ts and his maps into a \nknapsack, and he undertook the reckless adventure. \nDuring the first days they did not come across any apprecia ble obstacle. \nThey went down along the stony bank of the river to the  place where years before \nthey had found the soldier’s armor, and from there the y went into the woods \nalong a path between wild orange trees. At the end o f the first week they killed \nand roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half o f it and salt the rest for the \ndays that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of \nhaving to eat macaws, whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste. Then, for \nmore than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The  ground became soft and \ndamp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker a nd thicker, and the cries \nof the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more a nd more remote, and \nthe world became eternally sad. The men on the expedit ion felt overwhelmed by \ntheir most ancient memories in that paradise of dampne ss and silence, going \nback to before original sin, as their boots sank into poo ls of steaming oil and their",
            "10": "machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders. F or a week, almost \nwithout speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers throug h a universe of grief, \nlighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects,  and their lungs were \noverwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood. They could  not return because the \nstrip that they were opening as they went along would so on close up with a new \nvegetation that. almost seemed to grow before their eyes. “It’s all right,” José \nArcadio Buendía would say. “The main thing is not to lo se our bearings.” Always \nfollowing his compass, he kept on guiding his men toward  the invisible north so \nthat they would be able to get out of that enchante d region. It was a thick night, \nstarless, but the darkness was becoming impregnated with a  fresh and clear air. \nExhausted by the long crossing, they hung up their hammocks and slept deeply \nfor the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with  the sun already high in \nthe sky, they were speechless with fascination. Before them,  surrounded by ferns \nand palm trees, white and powdery in the silent mornin g light, was an enormous \nSpanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact \nmasts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its riggin g, which was adorned with \norchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, \nwas firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole st ructure seemed to \noccupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protecte d from the vices of \ntime and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the ex peditionaries explored with \ncareful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers. \nThe discovery of the galleon, an indication of the pro ximity of the sea, broke \nJosé Arcadio Buendía’s drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to \nhave searched for the sea without finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices \nand suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden  without looking for it, as if it lay \nacross his path like an insurmountable object. Many years l ater Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía crossed the region again, when it was already a  regular mail route, and \nthe only part of the ship he found was its burned-out f rame in the midst of a field",
            "11": "of poppies. Only then, convinced that the story had not be en some product of his \nfather’s imagination, did he wonder how the galleon had been able to get inland \nto that spot. But José Arcadio Buendía did not concern hi mself with that when he \nfound the sea after another four days’ journey from th e galleon. His dreams \nended as he faced that ashen, foamy, dirty sea, which ha d not merited the risks \nand sacrifices of the adventure. \n“God damn it!” he shouted. “Macondo is surrounded by wa ter on all sides.” \nThe idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a lon g time, inspired by the \narbitrary map that José Arcadio Buendía sketched on his ret urn from the \nexpedition. He drew it in rage, evilly, exaggerating the difficulties of \ncommunication, as if to punish himself for the absolut e lack of sense with which \nhe had chosen the place. “We’ll never get anywhere,” h e lamented to Úrsula. \n“We’re going to rot our lives away here without recei ving the benefits of science.” \nThat certainty, mulled over for several months in the small room he used as his \nlaboratory, brought him to the conception of the plan to move Maeondo to a \nbetter place. But that time Úrsula had anticipated his feverish designs. With the \nsecret and implacable labor of a small ant she predisposed  th e  w o m en  o f  t h e \nvillage against the flightiness of their husbands, who w ere already preparing for \nthe move. José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what mo ment or because of \nwhat adverse forces his plan had become enveloped in a w eb of pretexts, \ndisappointments, and evasions until it turned into not hing but an illusion. Úrsula \nwatched him with innocent attention and even felt some  pity for him on the \nmorning when she found him in the back room muttering  about his plans for \nmoving as he placed his laboratory pieces in their origi nal boxes. She let him \nfinish. She let him nail up the boxes and put his ini tials on them with an inked \nbrush, without reproaching him, but knowing now tha t he knew (because she had \nheard him say so in his soft monologues) that the men of the village would not \nback him up in his undertaking. Only when he began to ta ke down the door of the",
            "12": "room did Úrsula dare ask him what he was doing, and he  answered with a certain \nbitterness. “Since no one wants to leave, we’ll leave all by ourselves.” Úrsula did \nnot become upset. \n“We will not leave,” she said. “We will stay here, becau se we have had a son \nhere.” \n“We have still not had a death,” he said. “A person do es not belong to a \nplace until there is someone dead under the ground.” \nÚrsula replied with a soft firmness: \n“If I have to die for the rest of you to stay here, I w ill die.” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía had not thought that his wife’s wi ll was so firm. He \ntried to seduce her with the charm of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious \nworld where all one had to do was sprinkle some magic l iquid on the ground and \nthe plants would bear fruit whenever a man wished, a nd where all manner of \ninstruments against pain were sold at bargain prices. But  Úrsula was insensible \nto his clairvoyance. \n“Instead of going around thinking about your crazy inve ntions, you should be \nworrying about your sons,” she replied. “Look at the state  they’re in, running wild \njust like donkeys.” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía took his wife’s words literally. He lo oked out the \nwindow and saw the barefoot children in the sunny gard en and he had the \nimpression that only at that instant had they begun to e xist, conceived by Úrsula’s \nspell, Something occurred inside of him then, something  mysterious and definitive \nthat uprooted him from his own time and carried him a drift through an unexplored \nregion of his memory. While Úrsula continued sweeping t he house, which was \nsafe now from being abandoned for the rest of her lif e, he stood there with an \nabsorbed look, contemplating the children until his eyes became moist and he \ndried them with the back of his hand, exhaling a deep si gh of resignation.",
            "13": "“All right,” he said. “Tell them to come help me take the things out of the \nboxes.” \nJosé Arcadio, the older of the children, was fourteen. He had a square head, \nthick hair, and his father’s character. Although he had t he same impulse for \ngrowth and physical strength, it was early evident that h e lacked imagination. He \nhad been conceived and born during the difficult crossing  of the mountains, \nbefore the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven when \nthey saw he had no animal features. Aureliano, the fir st human being to be born \nin Macondo, would be six years old in March. He was silent  an d wi th drawn . H e \nhad wept in his mother’s womb and had been born with his eyes open. As they \nwere cutting the umbilical cord, he moved his head from  side to side, taking in the \nthings in the room and examining the faces of the peop le with a fearless curiosity. \nThen, indifferent to those who came close to look at hi m, he kept his attention \nconcentrated on the palm roof, which looked as if it we re about to collapse under \nthe tremendous pressure of the rain. Úrsula did not re member the intensity of that \nlook again until one day when little Aureliano, at th e age of three, went into the \nkitchen at the moment she was taking a pot of boiling sou p from the stove and \nputting it on the table. The child, Perplexed, said from the doorway, “It’s going to \nspill.” The pot was firmly placed in the center of the t able, but just as soon as the \nchild made his announcement, it began an unmistakable mo vement toward the \nedge, as if impelled by some inner dynamism, and it fel l and broke on the floor. \nÚrsula, alarmed, told her husband about the episode, b ut he interpreted it as a \nnatural phenomenon. That was the way he always was alien  to the existence of \nhis sons, partly because he considered childhood as a period  o f  m e n t a l  \ninsufficiency, and partly because he was always too absorbed in his fantastic \nspeculations. \nBut since the afternoon when he called the children in to help him unpack \nthe things in the laboratory, he gave them his best hou rs. In the small separate",

Other gypsies confirmed later on that \nMelquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the be ach at Singapore and \nthat his body had been thrown into the deepest part of  the Java Sea.

The burns changed he r into a useless wife for \nthe rest of her days. She could only sit on one side, cush ioned by pillows, and \nsomething strange must have happened to her way of walk ing, for she never \nwalked again in public. She gave up all kinds of social activity, obsessed with the \nnotion that her body gave off a singed odor. Dawn wou ld find her in the courtyard, \nfor she did not dare fall asleep lest she dream of the  English and their ferocious \nattack dogs as they came through the windows of her bedro om to submit her to \nshameful tortures with their red-hot irons. Her husband , an Aragonese merchant \nby whom she had two children, spent half the value of his store on medicines and \npastimes in an attempt to alleviate her terror. Final ly he sold the business and \ntook the family to live far from the sea in a settlem ent of peaceful Indians located \nin the foothills, where he built his wife a bedroom w ithout windows so that the \npirates of her dream would have no way to get in. \nIn that hidden village there was a native-born tobacco  planter who had lived \nthere for some time, Don José Arcadio Buendía, with who m Úrsula’s great-great-\ngrandfather established a partnership that was so lucra tive that within a few years \nthey made a fortune. Several centuries later the great -great-grandson of the \nnative-born planter married the great-great-grandda ughter of the Aragonese. \nTherefore, every time that Úrsula became exercised over  her husband’s mad \nideas, she would leap back over three hundred years of fa te and curse the day \nthat Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha. It was simp ly a way. of giving \nherself some relief, because actually they were joined t ill death by a bond that",
            "1": "was more solid that love: a common prick of conscience. The y were cousins. \nThey had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, with \ntheir work and their good habits, had transformed into  one of the finest towns in \nthe province. Although their marriage was predicted f rom the time they had come \ninto the world, when they expressed their desire to be  married their own relatives \ntried to stop it. They were afraid that those two heal thy products of two races that \nhad interbred over the centuries would suffer the sh ame of breeding iguanas. \nThere had already been a horrible precedent. An aunt of Úrsula’s, married to an \nuncle of José Arcadio Buendía, had a son who went thro ugh life wearing loose, \nbaggy trousers and who bled to death after having lived forty-two years in the \npurest state of virginity, for he had been born and ha d grown up with a \ncartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a  small tuft of hair on the \ntip. A pig’s tail that was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost \nhim his life when a butcher friend did him the favor  of chopping it off with his \ncleaver. José Arcadio Buendía, with the whimsy of his nine teen years, resolved \nthe problem with a single phrase: “I don’t care if I h ave piglets as long as they can \ntalk.” So they were married amidst a festival of firewo rks and a brass band that \nwent on for three days. They would have been happy from  then on if Úrsula’s \nmother had not terrified her with all manner of sini ster predictions about their \noffspring, even to the extreme of advising her to re fuse to consummate the \nmarriage. Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she \nslept, Úrsula, before going to bed, would put on a ru dimentary kind of drawers \nthat her mother had made out of sailcloth and had rei nforced with a system of \ncrisscrossed leather straps and that was closed in the front b y a thick iron buckle. \nThat was how they lived for several months. During the day he would take care of \nhis fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with  h er m oth er. A t ni gh t \nthey would wrestle for several hours in an anguished vio lence that seemed to be \na substitute for the act of love, until popular intuit ion got a whiff of something",

José Arcadio B uendía was the last \none to hear the rumor. \n“Look at what people are going around saying, Úrsula,” he told his wife very \ncalmly. \n“Let them talk,” she said. “We know that it’s not true.”  \nSo the situation went on the same way for another six m onths until that \ntragic Sunday when José Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight fro m Prudencio \nAguilar. Furious, aroused by the blood of his bird, the  loser backed away from \nJosé Arcadio Buendía so that everyone in the cockpit could h ear what he was \ngoing to tell him. \n“Congratulations!” he shouted. “Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife \na favor.” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía serenely picked up his rooster. “I’ll b e right back,” he \ntold everyone. And then to Prudencio Aguilar: \n“You go home and get a weapon, because I’m going to ki ll you.” \nTen minutes later he returned with the notched spear that had belonged to \nhis grandfather. At the door to the cockpit, where hal f the town had gathered, \nPrudencio Aguilar was waiting for him. There was no t ime to defend himself. José \nArcadio Buendía’s spear, thrown with the strength of a bull and with the same \ngood aim with which the first Aureliano Buendía had exterminated the jaguars in \nthe region, pierced his throat. That night, as they hel d a wake over the corpse in \nthe cockpit, José Arcadio Buendía went into the bedroom as his wife was putting \non her chastity pants. Pointing the spear at her he ord ered: “Take them off.” \nÚrsula had no doubt about her husband’s decision. “You’ ll be responsible for \nwhat happens,” she murmured. José Arcadio Buendía stuck the  spear into the \ndirt floor.",

One night, when she could n ot sleep, Úrsula went \nout into the courtyard to get some water and she saw Pru dencio Aguilar by the \nwater jar. He was livid, a sad expression on his face, trying to cover the hole in \nhis throat with a plug made of esparto grass. It did no t bring on fear in her, but \npity. She went back to the room and told her husband wh at she had seen, but he \ndid not think much of it. “This just means that we can’t  stand the weight of our \nconscience.” Two nights later Úrsula saw Prudencio Aguila r again, in the \nbathroom, using the esparto plug to wash the clotted blood from his throat. On \nanother night she saw him strolling in the rain. José A rcadio Buendía, annoyed by \nhis wife’s hallucinations, went out into the courtyard a rmed with the spear. There \nwas the dead man with his sad expression. \n“You go to hell,” José Arcadio Buendía shouted at him. “Just as many times \nas you come back, I’ll kill you again.” \nPrudencio Aguilar did not go away, nor did José Arcadio  Buendía dare throw \nthe spear. He never slept well after that. He was torm ented by the immense \ndesolation with which the dead man had looked at him  through the rain, his deep \nnostalgia as he yearned for living people, the anxiety w ith which he searched \nthrough the house looking for some water with which to  soak his esparto plug. \n“He must be suffering a great deal,” he said to Úrsula.  “You can see that he’s so \nvery lonely.” She was so moved that the next time she sa w the dead man \nuncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he  was looking for, and \nfrom then on she placed water jugs all about the house . One night when he found",

Go in p eace now.” \nThat was how they undertook the crossing of the mountains.  Several friends \nof José Arcadio Buendía, young men like him, excited, by the adventure, dis-\nmantled their houses and packed up, along with their wi ves and children, to head \ntoward the land that no one had promised them. Befo re he left, José Arcadio \nBuendía buried the spear in the courtyard and, one aft er the other, he cut the \nthroats of his magnificent fighting cocks, trusting that i n that way he could give \nsome measure of peace to Prudencio Aguilar. All that Úrsula took along were a \ntrunk with her bridal clothes, a few household utensil s, and the small chest with \nthe gold pieces that she had inherited from her father . They did not lay out any \ndefinite itinerary. They simply tried to go in a direct ion opposite to the road to \nRiohacha so that they would not leave any trace or meet  any people they knew. It \nwas an absurd journey. After fourteen months, her stoma ch corrupted by monkey \nmeat and snake stew, Úrsula gave birth to a son who ha d all of his features \nhuman. She had traveled half of the trip in a hammock  that two men carried on \ntheir shoulders, because swelling had disfigured her leg s and her varicose veins \nhad puffed up like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to  see them with their sunken \nstomachs and languid eyes, the children survived the jour ney better than their \nparents, and most of the time it was fun for them. One  morning, after almost two \nyears of crossing, they became the first mortals to see the w estern slopes of the \nmountain range. From the cloudy summit they saw the im mense aquatic expanse \nof the great swamp as it spread out toward the other si de of the world. But they \nnever found the sea. One night, after several months o f lost wandering through \nthe swamps, far away now from the last Indians they had m et on their way, they \ncamped on the banks of a stony river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen",

Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel  Aureliano Buendía tried to \nfollow that same route in order to take Riohacha by su rprise and after six days of \ntraveling he understood that it was madness. Neverthele ss, the night on which \nthey camped beside the river, his father’s host had the l ook of shipwrecked \npeople with no escape, but their number had grown du ring the crossing and they \nwere all prepared (and they succeeded) to die of old age. José Arcadio Buendía \ndreamed that night that right there a noisy city with h ouses having mirror wails \nrose up. He asked what city it was and they answered him w ith a name that he \nhad never heard, that had no meaning at all, but th at had a supernatural echo in \nhis dream: Macondo. On the following day he convinced hi s men that they would \nnever find the sea. He ordered them to cut down the trees to make a clearing \nbeside the river, at the coolest spot on the bank, and t here they founded the \nvillage. \nJosé Arcadio Buendía did not succeed in deciphering the dr eam of houses \nwith mirror walls until the day he discovered ice. Then he thought he understood \nits deep meaning. He thought that in the near future  they would be able to \nmanufacture blocks of ice on a large scale from such a commo n material as \nwater and with them build the new houses of the villa ge. Macondo would no \nlonger be a burning place, where the hinges and door knockers twisted with the \nheat, but would be changed into a wintry city. If he d id not persevere in his \nattempts to build an ice factory, it was because at that t ime he was absolutely \nenthusiastic over the education of his sons, especially that  of Aureliano, who from \nthe first had revealed a strange intuition for alchem y. The laboratory had been \ndusted off. Reviewing Melquíades’ notes, serene now, wit hout the exaltation of \nnovelty, in prolonged and patient sessions they tried to separate Úrsula’s gold \nfrom the debris that was stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Young José Arcadio \nscarcely took part in the process. While his father was invo lved body and soul \nwith his water pipe, the willful first-born, who had always been too big for his age,",

One night, as Úrsula went i nto the room where he was \nundressing to go to bed, she felt a mingled sense of sha me and pity: he was the \nfirst man that she had seen naked after her husband, an d he was so well-\nequipped for life that he seemed abnormal. Úrsula, p regnant for the third time, \nrelived her newlywed terror. \nAround that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocative w oman came to the \nhouse to help with the chorea, and she knew how to re ad the future in cards. \nÚrsula spoke to her about her son. She thought that his disproportionate size \nwas something as unnatural as her cousin’s tail of a pig. The woman let out an \nexpansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken glass. \n“Just the opposite,” she said. “He’ll be very lucky.” In ord er to confirm her \nprediction she brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself \nup with José Arcadio in a granary off the kitchen. She ca lmly placed her cards on \nan old carpenter’s bench. saying anything that came int o her head, while the boy \nwaited beside her, more bored than intrigued. Sudden ly she reached out her \nhand and touched him. “Lordy!” she said, sincerely startl ed, and that was all she \ncould say.

But José Arcadio kept \nlooking for her all night long, for the smell of smoke  that she had under her \narmpits and that had got caught under his skin.

One day he could not stand it  any more and. he went \nlooking for her at her house: He made a formal visit, sitting uncomprehendingly in \nthe living room without saying a word. At that moment he had no desire for her. \nHe found her different, entirely foreign to the imag e that her smell brought on, as \nif she were someone else.

Even when they brough t the ice they did \nnot advertise it for its usefulness in the life of man b ut as a simple circus curiosity. \nThis time, along with many other artifices, they broug ht a flying carpet. But they \ndid not offer it as a fundamental contribution to th e development of transport, \nrather as an object of recreation. The people at once d ug up their last gold pieces \nto take advantage of a quick flight over the houses of the village. Protected by the \ndelightful cover of collective disorder, José Arcadio and Pilar passed many \nrelaxing hours. They were two happy lovers among the crow d, and they even \ncame to suspect that love could be a feeling that was mo re relaxing and deep \nthan the happiness, wild but momentary, of their secret nights. Pilar, however, \nbroke the spell. Stimulated by the enthusiasm that José A rcadio showed in her \ncompanionship, she confused the form and the occasion, an d all of a sudden she",
            "12": "threw the whole world on top of him. “Now you really are a man,” she told him. \nAnd since he did not understand what she meant, she spell ed it out to him. \n“You’re going to be a father.” \nJosé Arcadio did not dare leave the house for several da ys. It was enough \nfor him to hear the rocking laughter of Pilar in the  kitchen to run and take refuge \nin the laboratory, where the artifacts of alchemy had co me alive again with \nÚrsula’s blessing. José Arcadio Buendía received his errant son with joy and \ninitiated him in the search for the philosopher’s stone,  w h i c h  h e  h a d  f i n a l l y  \nundertaken. One afternoon the boys grew enthusiastic over  the flying carpet that \nwent swiftly by the laboratory at window level carrying t he gypsy who was driving \nit and several children from the village who were mer rily waving their hands, but \nJosé Arcadio Buendía did not even look at it. “Let them  dream,” he said. “We’ll do \nbetter flying than they are doing, and with more scient ific resources than a \nmiserable bedspread.” In spite of his feigned interest, José Arcadio must \nunderstood the powers of the philosopher’s egg, which t o him looked like a poorly \nblown bottle. He did not succeed in escaping from his wo rries. He lost his appe-\ntite and he could not sleep. He fell into an ill hum or, the same as his father’s over \nthe failure of his undertakings, and such was his upset t hat José Arcadio Buendía \nhimself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, t hinking that he had taken \nalchemy too much to heart. Aureliano, of course, under stood that his brother’s \naffliction did not have its source in the search for the  philosopher’s stone but he \ncould not get into his confidence. He had lost his form er spontaneity. From an \naccomplice and a communicative person he had become withd rawn and hostile. \nAnxious for solitude, bitten by a virulent rancor against  the world, one night he left \nhis bed as usual, but he did not go to Pilar Ternera’ s house, but to mingle is the \ntumult of the fair. After wandering about among all  kinds of contraptions with out \nbecoming interested in any of them, he spotted something  that was not a part of it \nall: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, who was weigh ted down by beads and",
            "13": "was the most beautiful woman that José Arcadio had ever seen in his life. She \nwas in the crowd that was witnessing the sad spectacle of th e man who had been \nturned into a snake for having disobeyed his parents. \nJosé Arcadio paid no attention. While the sad interroga tion of the snake-man \nwas taking place, he made his way through the crowd up to  the front row, where \nthe gypsy girl was, and he stooped behind her. He pressed against her back. The \ngirl tried to separate herself, but José Arcadio pressed m ore strongly against her \nback. Then she felt him. She remained motionless against  h i m ,  t r e m b l i n g  w i t h  \nsurprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and  finally she turned her head \nand looked at him with a tremulous smile. At that inst ant two gypsies put the \nsnake-man into his cage and carried him into the tent. T he gypsy who was \nconducting the show announced: \n“And now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to show the terrible test of the \nwoman who must have her head chopped off every night at this time for one \nhundred and fifty years as punishment for having seen wh at she should not \nhave.” \nJosé Arcadio and the gypsy girl did not witness the decapita tion. They went \nto her tent, where they kissed each other with a despera te anxiety while they took \noff their clothes. The gypsy girl removed the starched la ce corsets she had on \nand there she was, changed into practically nothing. She  was a languid little frog, \nwith incipient breasts and legs so thin that they did no t even match the size of \nJosé Arcadio’s arms, but she had a decision and a warmth t hat compensated for \nher fragility. Nevertheless, José Arcadio could not respond  to her because they \nwere in a kind of public tent where the gypsies passed thr ough with their circus \nthings and did their business, and would even tarry by th e bed for a game of dice. \nThe lamp hanging from the center pole lighted the wh ole place up. During a \npause in the caresses, José Arcadio stretched out naked on the  b e d  w i t h o u t  \nknowing what to do, while the girl tried to inspire h im. A gypsy woman with",
            "14": "splendid flesh came in a short time after accompanied by a man who was not of \nthe caravan but who was not from the village either, a nd they both began to \nundress in front of the bed. Without meaning to, the  woman looked at José \nArcadio and examined his magnificent animal in repose w ith a kind of pathetic \nfervor. \n“My boy,” she exclaimed, “may God preserve you just as you ar e.” \nJosé Arcadio’s companion asked them to leave them alone, and the couple \nlay down on the ground, close to the bed. The passion of  the others woke up \nJosé Arcadio’s fervor. On the first contact the bones of th e girl seemed to become \ndisjointed with a disorderly crunch like the sound of a b ox of dominoes, and her \nskin broke out into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with  tears as her whole body \nexhaled a lugubrious lament and a vague smell of mud. But she bore the impact \nwith a firmness of character and a bravery that were adm irable. José Arcadio felt \nhimself lifted up into the air toward a state of serap hic inspiration, where his heart \nburst forth with an outpouring of tender obscenities th at entered the girl through \nher ears and came out of her mouth translated into he r language. It was \nThursday. On Saturday night, José Arcadio wrapped a red c loth around his head \nand left with the gypsies. \nWhen Úrsula discovered his absence she searched for him a ll through the \nvillage. In the remains of the gypsy camp there was nothi ng but a garbage pit \namong the still smoking ashes of the extinguished camp fires. Someone who was \nthere looking for beads among the trash told Úrsula t hat the night before he had \nseen her son in the tumult of the caravan pushing the snake-man’s cage on a \ncart. “He’s become a gypsy” she shouted to her husband, wh o had not shown the \nslightest sign of alarm over the disappearance. \n“I hope it’s true,” José Arcadio Buendía said, grinding in his mortar the \nmaterial that had been ground a thousand times and re heated and ground again. \n“That way he’ll learn to be a man.” Úrsula asked wher e the gypsies had gone.",
            "15": "She went along asking and following the road she had  been shown, thinking that \nshe still had time to catch up to them. She kept getting  farther away from the \nvillage until she felt so far away that she did not th ink about returning. José \nArcadio Buendía did not discover that his wife was missin g until eight o’clock at \nnight, when he left the material warming in a bed o f manure and went to see what \nwas wrong with little Amaranta, who was getting hoarse  from crying. In a few \nhours he gathered a group of well-equipped men, put Amaranta in the hands of a \nwoman who offered to nurse her, and was lost on invisibl e paths in pursuit of \nÚrsula. Aureliano went with them. Some Indian fisher men, whose language they \ncould not understand, told them with signs that they had  not seen anyone pass. \nAfter three days of useless searching they returned to the village. \nFor several weeks José Arcadio Buendía let himself be over come by \nconsternation. He took care of little Amaranta like a mo ther. He bathed and \ndressed her, took her to be nursed four times a day, and even sang to her at \nnight the songs that Úrsula never knew how to sing. On a certain occasion Pilar \nTernera volunteered to do the household chores until Úrsula came back. \nAureliano, whose mysterious intuition had become sharpe ned with the \nmisfortune, felt a glow of clairvoyance when he saw her come in. Then he knew \nthat in some inexplicable way she was to blame for his b rother’s flight and the \nconsequent disappearance of his mother, and he harassed he r with a silent and \nimplacable hostility in such a way that the woman did n ot return to the house. \nTime put things in their place. José Arcadio Buendía and  his son did not \nknow exactly when they returned to the laboratory, dustin g things, lighting the \nwater pipe, involved once more in the patient manipu lation of the material that \nhad been sleeping for several months in its bed of ma nure. Even Amaranta, lying \nin a wicker basket, observed with curiosity the absorbing work of her father and \nher brother in the small room where the air was rare fied by mercury vapors. On a \ncertain occasion, months after Úrsula’s departure, strang e things began to",
            "16": "happen. An empty flask that had been forgotten in a cu pboard for a long time \nbecame so heavy that it could not be moved. A pan of wa ter on the worktable \nboiled without any fire under it for a half hour unt il it completely evaporated. José \nArcadio Buendía and his son observed those phenomena wit h startled \nexcitement, unable to explain them but interpreting  them as predictions of the \nmaterial. One day Amaranta’s basket began to move by itse lf and made a \ncomplete turn about the room, to the consternation of Auerliano, who hurried to \nstop it. But his father did not get upset. He put the basket in its place and tied it to \nthe leg of a table, convinced that the long-awaited e vent was imminent. It was on \nthat occasion that Auerliano heard him say: \n“If you don’t fear God, fear him through the metals. \nSuddenly, almost five months after her disappearance, Úr sula came back. \nShe arrived exalted, rejuvenated, with new clothes in  a style that was unknown in \nthe village. José Arcadio Buendía could barely stand up u nder the impact. “That \nwas it!” he shouted. “I knew it was going to happen.” And he really believed it, for \nduring his prolonged imprisonment as he manipulated th e material, he begged in \nthe depth of his heart that the longed-for miracle should not be the discovery of \nthe philosopher’s stone, or the freeing of the breath that makes metals live, or the \nfaculty to convert the hinges and the locks of the house i nto gold, but what had \njust happened: Úrsula’s return. But she did not share h is excitement. She gave \nhim a conventional kiss, as if she had been away only an ho ur, and she told him: \n“Look out the door.” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía took a long time to get out of his  perplexity when he \nwent out into the street and saw the crowd. They were n ot gypsies. They were \nmen and women like them, with straight hair and dark ski n, who spoke the same \nlanguage and complained of the same pains. They had mu les loaded down with \nthings to eat, oxcarts with furniture and domestic utensi ls, pure and simple earthly \naccessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyda y reality. They",
            "17": "came from the other side of the swamp, only two days away , where there were \ntowns that received mail every month in the year and whe re they were familiar \nwith the implements of good living. Úrsula had not caug ht up with the gypsies, but \nshe had found the route that her husband had been una ble to discover in his \nfrustrated search for the great inventions."

            "0": "PILAR TERNERA’S son was brought to his grand parents’ h ouse two weeks \nafter he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conq uered once more by the \nobstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the ide a that an offshoot of his \nblood should be adrift, but he imposed the condition that the child should never \nknow his true identity. Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended \nup calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confusion. At that time there was so \nmuch activity in the town and so much bustle in the house  that the care of the \nchildren was relegated to a secondary level. They were pu t in the care of \nVisitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in  town with a brother in flight \nfrom a plague of insomnia that had been scourging the ir tribe for several years. \nThey were both so docile and willing to help that Úrs ula took them on to help her \nwith her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Am aranta came to speak \nthe Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learn ed to drink lizard broth and \neat spider eggs without Úrsula’s knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising \nbusiness in candy animals. Macondo had changed. The peopl e who had come \nwith Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged \nposition with respect to the swamp, so that from the nar row village of past times it \nchanged into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent \ncommercial route over which the first Arabs arrived wit h their baggy pants and \nrings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws. José Ar cadio Buendía did \nnot have a moment’s rest. Fascinated by an immediate re ality that came to be \nmore fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination , he lost all interest in the \nalchemist’s laboratory, put to rest the material that h ad become attenuated with \nmonths of manipulation, and went back to being the ent erprising man of earlier \ndays when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the",
            "1": "new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that ev eryone did not have. He \nacquired such authority among the new arrivals that fo undations were not laid or \nwalls built without his being consulted, and it was de cided that he should be the \none in charge of the distribution of the land. When the acrobat gypsies returned, \nwith their vagabond carnival transformed now into a g igantic organization of \ngames of luck and chance, they were received with great  joy, for it was thought \nthat José Arcadio would be coming back with them. But José  Arcadio did not \nreturn, nor did they come with the snake-man, who, accor ding to what Úrsula \nthought, was the only one who could tell them about th eir son, so the gypsies \nwere not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in  the future, for they were \nconsidered the bearers of concupiscence and perversion. José  Arcadio Buendía, \nhowever, was explicit in maintaining that the old tr ibe of Melquíades, who had \ncontributed so much to the growth of the village with  his age-old wisdom and his \nfabulous inventions, would always find the gates open. B ut Melquíades’ tribe, \naccording to what the wanderers said, had been wiped of f the face of the earth \nbecause they had gone beyond the limits of human knowle dge. \nEmancipated for the moment at least from the torment  of fantasy, José \nArcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order  and work which allowed \nfor only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the \nfounding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place \nmusical clocks in every house. They were wondrous clocks made of ca rved \nwood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which Jo sé Arcadio Buendía \nhad synchronized with such precision that every half h our the town grew merry \nwith the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a \nnoontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete wa ltz. It was also José \nArcadio Buendía who decided during those years that the y should plant almond \ntrees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered,  w i t h o u t  e v e r  \nrevealing it, a way to make them live forever. Many yea rs later, when Macondo",
            "2": "was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken  and dusty almond trees \nstill stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them. \nWhile his father was putting the town in order and hi s mother was increasing their \nwealth with her marvelous business of candied little ro osters and fish, which left \nthe house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aur eliano spent \ninterminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learn ing the art of silverwork by \nhis own experimentation. He had shot up so fast that i n a short time the clothing \nleft behind by his brother no longer fit him and he b egan to wear his father’s, but \nVisitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in t he pants, because Aureliano \nhad not sequined the corpulence of the others. Adolescence  had taken away the \nsoftness of his voice and had made him silent and defini tely solitary, but, on the \nother hand, it had restored the intense expression tha t he had had in his eyes \nwhen he was born. He concentrated so much on his experim ents in silverwork \nthat he scarcely left the laboratory to eat. Worried eve r his inner withdrawal, José \nArcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the house and a lit tle money, thinking that \nperhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the m oney on muriatic acid to \nprepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by pl ating them with gold. \nHis excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who \nhad already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching \nat the Indians’ cloaks, stubborn in their decision not t o speak Spanish but the \nGuajiro language. “You shouldn’t complain.” Úrsula to ld her husband. “Children \ninherit their parents’ madness.” And as she was lamentin g her misfortune, \nconvinced that the wild behavior of her children was som ething as fearful as a \npig’s tail, Aureliano gave her a look that wrapped he r in an atmosphere of \nuncertainty. \n“Somebody is coming,” he told her. \nÚrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried  t o  b r e a k  i t  d o w n  \nwith her housewifely logic. It was normal for someone to  be coming. Dozens of",
            "3": "strangers came through Macondo every day without arousing suspicion or secret \nideas. Nevertheless, beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure o f his prediction. \n“I don’t know who it will be,” he insisted, “but whoeve r it is is already on the \nway.” \nThat Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleve n years old. She \nhad made the difficult trip from Manaure with some h ide dealers who had taken \non the task of delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they \ncould not explain precisely who the person was who had aske d the favor. Her \nentire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocki ng chair with small hand-\npainted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, \nwhere she carried her parents’ bones. The letter addresse d to José Arcadio \nBuendía was written is very warm terms by someone who stil l loved him very \nmuch in spite of time and distance, and who felt oblig ed by a basic humanitarian \nfeeling to do the charitable thing and send him that  poor unsheltered orphan, who \nwas a second cousin of Úrsula’s and consequently also a relat ive of José Arcadio \nBuendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that \nunforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may \nGod keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the gi rl was carrying so that \nthey might be given Christian burial. The names mentio ned, as well as the \nsignature on the letter, were perfectly legible, but n either José Arcadio, Buendía \nnor Úrsula remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know \nanyone by the name of the sender of the letter, much less the remote village of \nManaure. It was impossible to obtain any further inform ation from the girl. From \nthe moment she arrived she had been sitting in the r ocker, sucking her finger and \nobserving everyone with her large, startled eyes without  giving any sign of \nunderstanding what they were asking her. She wore a dia gonally striped dress \nthat had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scal y patent leather boots. \nHer hair was held behind her ears with bows of black rib bon. She wore a scapular",
            "4": "with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wr ist the fang of a \ncarnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an a mulet against the evil \neye. Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a  drum . rev eal ed poor \nhealth and hunger that were older than she was, but when they gave her \nsomething to eat she kept the plate on her knees withou t tasting anything. They \neven began to think that she was a deaf-mute until the Indians asked her in their \nlanguage if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized \nthem and said yes with her head. \nThey kept her, because there was nothing else they could  do. They decided \nto call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was h er mother’s name, because \nAureliano had the patience to read to her the names o f all the saints and he did \nnot get a reaction from any one of them. Since there w as no cemetery in \nMacondo at that time, for no one had died up till th en, they kept the bag of bones \nto wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way \neverywhere and would be found where least expected, al ways with its clucking of \na broody hen. A long time passed before Rebeca became in corporated into the \nlife of the family. She would sit in her small rocker suck ing her finger in the most \nremote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her att ention except the music of \nthe clocks, which she would look for every half hour with  her frightened eyes as if \nshe hoped to find it someplace in the air. They could no t get her to eat for several \ndays. No one understood why she had not died of hunger until the Indians, who \nwere aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly about  the house on their \nstealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the  d a m p  e a r t h  o f  t h e  \ncourtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the  walls with her nails. It \nwas obvious that her parents, or whoever had raised her , had scolded her for that \nhabit because she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away \nsupplies so that she could eat when no one was looking . From then on they put \nher under an implacable watch. They threw cow gall onto  the courtyard and,",
            "5": "rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defe at her pernicious vice with \nthose methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness an d ingenuity to find \nsome earth that Úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. She put \nsome orange juice and rhubarb into a pan that she left  in  th e dew al l  ni gh t an d \nshe gave her the dose the following day on an empty stom ach. Although no one \nhad told her that it was the specific remedy for the vic e of eating earth, she \nthought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach woul d have to make the \nliver react. Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they \nhad to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, and they could \nbarely keep back her kicks or bear up under the strange hier oglyphics that she \nalternated with her bites and spitting, and that, accor ding to what the scandalized \nIndians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their \nlanguage. When Úrsula discovered that, she added whippi ng to the treatment. It \nwas never established whether it was the rhubarb or th e beatings that had effect, \nor both of them together, but the truth was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to \nshow signs of recovery. She took part in the games of Arca dio and Amaranta, \nwho treated her like an older sister, and she ate hear tily, using the utensils \nproperly. It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish wi th as much fluency as \nthe Indian language, that she had a remarkable abili ty for manual work, and that \nshe could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funn y words that she \nherself had invented. It did not take long for them t o consider her another \nmember of the family. She was more affectionate to Úr sula than any of her own \nchildren had been, and she called Arcadio, and Amarant a brother and sister, \nAureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally \ndeserved, as much as the others, the name of Rebeca Buen día, the only one that \nshe ever had and that she bore with dignity until her death. \nOne night about the time that Rebeca was cured of the  vice of eating earth \nand was brought to sleep in the other children’s room,  th e In di an  wom an , wh o",

She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal had come into the room, and \nthen she saw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and  with her eyes lighted \nup in the darkness like those of a cat. Terrified, exhaust ed by her fate, Visitación \nrecognized in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose t hreat had obliged \nher and her brother to exile themselves forever from a n age-old kingdom where \nthey had been prince and princess. It was the insomnia pla gue. \nCataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by mornin g. His sister stayed \nbecause her fatalistic heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no \nmatter what, to the farthest corner of the earth. No one understood Visitación’s \nalarm. “If we don’t ever sleep again, so much the be tter,” José Arcadio Buendía \nsaid in good humor. “That way we can get more out of l ife.” But the Indian woman \nexplained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the \nimpossibility of sleeping, for the body did not feel an y fatigue at all, but its \ninexorable evolution toward a more critical manifestat ion: a loss of memory. She \nmeant that when the sick person became used to his state of  v i g i l ,  t h e  \nrecollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name \nand notion of things, and finally the identity of peop le and even the awareness of \nhis own being, until he sank into a kind of idiocy that h ad no past. José Arcadio \nBuendía, dying with laughter, thought that it was just  a question of one of the \nmany illnesses invented by the Indians’ superstitions. But Ú rsula, just to be safe, \ntook the precaution of isolating Rebeca from the other children. \nAfter several weeks, when Visitación’s terror seemed to have died down, \nJosé Arcadio Buendía found himself rolling over in bed, unable to fall asleep. \nÚrsula, who had also awakened, asked him what was wrong, and he answered: \n“I’m thinking about Prudencio Aguilar again.” They di d not sleep a minute, but the \nfollowing day they felt so rested that they forgot about  th e bad n igh t. A u rel i an o \ncommented with surprise at lunchtime that he felt very well in spite of the fact that",
            "7": "he had spent the whole night in the laboratory gildin g a brooch that he planned to \ngive to Úrsula for her birthday. They did not become alarmed until the third day, \nwhen no one felt sleepy at bedtime and they realized t hat they had gone more \nthan fifty hours without sleeping. \n“The children are awake too,” the Indian said with he r fatalistic conviction. \n“Once it gets into a house no one can escape the plague.”  \nThey had indeed contracted the illness of insomnia. Úrsu la, who had learned \nfrom her mother the medicinal value of plants, prepar ed and made them all drink \na brew of monkshood, but they could not get to sleep an d spent the whole day \ndreaming on their feet. In that state of hallucinate d lucidity, not only did they see \nthe images of their own dreams, but some saw the image s dreamed by others. It \nwas as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her  rocker in a corner of the \nkitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man who looked very much like her, dressed in \nwhite linen and with his shirt collar closed by a gold b utton, was bringing her a \nbouquet of roses. He was accompanied by a woman with deli cate hands who \ntook out one rose and put it in the child’s hair. Úrsul a understood that the man \nand woman were Rebeca’s parents, but even though she made a great effort to \nrecognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them. In the \nmeantime, through an oversight that José Arcadio Buendí a never forgave himself \nfor, the candy animals made in the house were still bei ng sold in the town. \nChildren and adults sucked with delight on the delicio us little green roosters of \ninsomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow ponies of \ninsomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake. No one was \nalarmed at first. On the contrary, they were happy at no t sleeping because there \nwas so much to do in Macondo in those days that there wa s barely enough time. \nThey worked so hard that soon they had nothing else to d o and they could be \nfound at three o’clock in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the notes \nin the waltz of the clock.

They would gather together to converse endl essly, to tell over and \nover for hours on end the same jokes, to complicate to th e limits of exasperation \nthe story about the capon, which was an endless game in w hich the narrator \nasked if they wanted him to tell them the story about th e capon, and when they \nanswered yes, the narrator would say that he had not asked  them to say yes, but \nwhether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they \nanswered no, the narrator told them that he had not asked them to say no, but \nwhether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they \nremained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to remain silent \nbut whether they wanted him to tell them the story abo ut the capon, and no one \ncould leave because the narrator would say that he had n ot asked them to leave \nbut whether they wanted him to tell them the story abo ut the capon, and so on \nand on in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights. \nWhen José Arcadio Buendía realized that the plague had invaded the town, \nhe gathered together the heads of families to explain  to them what he knew about \nthe sickness of insomnia, and they agreed on methods to  prevent the scourge \nfrom spreading to other towns in the swamp. That was wh y they took the bells off \nthe goats, bells that the Arabs had swapped them for m acaws, and put them at \nthe entrance to town at the disposal of those who wou ld not listen to the advice \nand entreaties of the sentinels and insisted on visiting  the town. All strangers who \npassed through the streets of Macondo at that time had t o ring their bells so that \nthe sick people would know that they were healthy. They were not allowed to eat \nor drink anything during their stay, for there was no d oubt but that the illness was \ntransmitted by mouth, and all food and drink had been contaminated by insomnia. \nIn that way they kept the plague restricted to the perim eter of the town. So \neffective was the quarantine that the day came when the  emergency situation \nwas accepted as a natural thing and life was organized i n such a way that work",
            "9": "picked up its rhythm again and no one worried any more a bout the useless habit \nof sleeping. \nIt was Aureliano who conceived the formula that was to protect them against \nloss of memory for several months. He discovered it by chan ce. An expert \ninsomniac, having been one of the first, he had learne d the art of silverwork to \nperfection. One day he was looking for the small anvil t hat he used for laminating \nmetals and he could not remember its name. His father told him: “Stake.” \nAureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper that h e pasted to the base of the \nsmall anvil: stake . In that way he was sure of not forgetting it in the  future. It did \nnot occur to him that this was the first manifestation o f a loss of memory, because \nthe object had a difficult name to remember. But a f ew days later be, discovered \nthat he had trouble remembering almost every object in  the laboratory. Then he \nmarked them with their respective names so that all he h ad to do was read the \ninscription in order to identify them. When his father told him about his alarm at \nhaving forgotten even the most impressive happenings of his childhood, \nAureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio  B u e n d í a  p u t  i t  i n t o  \npractice all through the house and later on imposed it on the whole village. With \nan inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, \nbed, pan . He went to the corral and marked the animals and pla nts: cow, goat, \npig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana . Little by little, studying the infinite \npossibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the da y might come when things \nwould be recognized by their inscriptions but that no one  woul d rem em ber th ei r \nuse. Then he was more explicit. The sign that he hung  on the neck of the cow \nwas an exemplary proof of the way in which the inhabita nts of Macondo were \nprepared to fight against loss of memory: This is the cow. She must be milked \nevery morning so that she will produce milk, and the milk must be boiled in order \nto be mixed with coffee to make coffee and milk . Thus they went on living in a",
            "10": "reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by wo rds, but which would \nescape irremediably when they forgot the values of the w ritten letters. \nAt the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said \nMACONDO and another larger one on the main street th at said GOD EXISTS. In \nall the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written. But the \nsystem demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that  many succumbed \nto the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less \npractical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who \ncontributed most to popularize that mystification when s he conceived the trick of \nreading the past in cards as she had read the future b efore. By means of that \nrecourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built o n the uncertain \nalternatives of the cards, where a father was remembere d faintly as the dark man \nwho had arrived at the beginning of April and a mot her was remembered only as \nthe dark woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand , and where a birth date \nwas reduced to the last Tuesday on which a lark sang in th e laurel tree. Defeated \nby those practices of consolation, José Arcadio Buendía then decided to build the \nmemory machine that he had desired once in order to r emember the marvelous \ninventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the p ossibility of reviewing \nevery morning, from beginning to end, the totality of  knowledge acquired during \none’s life. He conceived of it as a spinning dictionary t hat a person placed on the \naxis could operate by means of a lever, so that in a ver y few hours there would \npass before his eyes the notions most necessary for life. He h ad succeeded in \nwriting almost fourteen thousand entries when along th e road from the swamp a \nstrange-looking old man with the sad sleepers’ bell ap peared, carrying a bulging \nsuitcase tied with a rope and pulling a cart covered wit h black cloth. He went \nstraight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía. \nVisitación did not recognize him when she opened the do or and she thought \nhe had come with the idea of selling something, unawar e that nothing could be",

Although his voice was also broken by u ncertainty and his \nhands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evi dent that he came from \nthe world where men could still sleep and remember. José  Arcadio Buendía \nfound him sitting in the living room fanning himself  with a patched black hat as he \nread with compassionate attention the signs pasted to th e walls. He greeted him \nwith a broad show of affection, afraid that he had k nown him at another time and \nthat he did not remember him now. But the visitor was aware of his falseness, He \nfelt himself forgotten, not with the irremediable fo rgetfulness of the heart, but with \na different kind of forgetfulness, which was more cruel and irrevocable and which \nhe knew very well because it was the forgetfulness of dea th. Then he understood. \nHe opened the suitcase crammed with indecipherable obje cts and from among \nthen he took out a little case with many flasks. He gave José  Arcadio Buendía a \ndrink of a gentle color and the light went on in his m emory. His eyes became \nmoist from weeping even before he noticed himself in a n absurd living room \nwhere objects were labeled and before he was ashamed o f the solemn nonsense \nwritten on the walls, and even before he recognized t he newcomer with a \ndazzling glow of joy. It was Melquíades. \nWhile Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, Jo sé Arcadio \nBuendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendsh ip. The gypsy was inclined \nto stay in the town. He really had been through death,  b u t  h e  h a d  r e t u r n e d  \nbecause he could not bear the solitude. Repudiated by h is tribe, having lost all of \nhis supernatural faculties because of his faithfulness to life, he decided to take \nrefuge in that corner of the world which had still no t been discovered by death, \ndedicated to the operation of a daguerreotype laborat ory. José Arcadio Buendía \nhad never heard of that invention. But when he saw hi mself and his whole family \nfastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an etern ity, he was mute with \nstupefaction. That was the date of the oxidized daguer reotype in which José",
            "12": "Arcadio Buendía appeared with his bristly and graying ha ir, his card board collar \nattached to his shirt by a copper button, and an express ion of startled solemnity, \nwhom Úrsula described, dying with laughter, as a “frigh tened general.” José \nArcadio Buendía was, in fact, frightened on that dear December morning when \nthe daguerreotype was made, for he was thinking that pe ople were slowly \nwearing away while his image would endure an a metall ic plaque. Through a \ncurious reversal of custom, it was Úrsula who got that ide a out of his head, as it \nwas also she who forgot her ancient bitterness and decide d that Melquíades \nwould stay on in the house, although she never permitt ed them to make a \ndaguerreotype of her because (according to her very words)  she did not want to \nsurvive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren. That m orning she dressed the \nchildren in their best clothes, powdered their faces, and  gave a spoonful of \nmarrow syrup to each one so that they would all remain a bsolutely motionless \nduring the nearly two minutes in front of Melquíades f antastic camera. In the \nfamily daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Au reliano appeared dressed \nin black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca. He had the  same languor and the \nsame clairvoyant look that he would have years later as he  faced the firing squad. \nBut he still had not sensed the premonition of his fate . He was an expert \nsilversmith, praised all over the swampland for the del icacy of his work. In the \nworkshop, which he shared with Melquíades’ mad labora tory, he could barely be \nheard breathing. He seemed to be taking refuge in some  o t h e r  t i m e ,  w h i l e  h i s \nfather and the gypsy with shouts interpreted the predict ions of Nostradamus \namidst a noise of flasks and trays and the disaster of spill ed acids and silver \nbromide that was lost in the twists and turns it gave at  every instant. That dedica-\ntion to his work, the good judgment with which he dir ected his attention, had \nallowed Aureliano to earn in a short time more money than Úrsula had with her \ndelicious candy fauna, but everybody thought it strange t hat he was now a full-\ngrown man and had not known a woman. It was true that  he had never had one.",
            "13": "Several months later saw the return of Francisco the Man , as ancient \nvagabond who was almost two hundred years old and who f requently passed \nthrough Macondo distributing songs that he composed himsel f. In them Francisco \nthe Man told in great detail the things that had hap pened in the towns along his \nroute, from Manaure to the edge of the swamp, so that  if anyone had a message \nto send or an event to make public, he would pay him tw o cents to include it in his \nrepertory. That was how Úrsula learned of the death o f her mother, as a simple \nconsequence of listening to the songs in the hope that t hey would say something \nabout her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man, called that because he had once \ndefeated the devil in a duel of improvisation, and w hose real name no one knew, \ndisappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague an d one night he \nappeared suddenly in Catarino’s store. The whole town went to listen to him to \nfind out what had happened in the world. On that occa sion there arrived with him \na woman who was so fat that four Indians had to carry he r in a rocking chair, and \nan adolescent mulatto girl with a forlorn look who pr otected her from the sun with \nan umbrella. Aureliano went to Catarino’s store that night. He found Francisco the \nMan, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the midst of a circle of bystanders. He \nwas singing the news with his old, out-of-tune voice, acco mpanying himself with \nthe same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas \nand keeping time with his great walking feet that were  cracked from saltpeter. In \nfront of a door at the rear through which men were going and coming, the matron \nof the rocking chair was sitting and fanning herself in silence. Catarino, with a felt \nrose behind his ear, was selling the gathering mugs of f ermented cane juice, and \nhe took advantage of the occasion to go over to the m en and put his hand on \nthem where he should not have. Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. \nAureliano listened to the news to the end without hea ring anything that was of \ninterest to his family. He was getting ready to go home  when the matron signaled \nhim with her hand.",
            "14": "“You go in too.” she told him. “It only costs twenty cents. ” \nAureliano threw a coin into the hopper that the mat ron had in her lap and \nwent into the room without knowing why. The adolescent  m u l a t t o  g i r l ,  w i t h  h e r  \nsmall bitch’s teats, was naked on the bed. Before Aureli ano sixty-three men had \npassed through the room that night. From being used so much, kneaded with \nsweat and sighs, the air in the room had begun to tur n to mud. The girl took off \nthe soaked sheet and asked Aureliano to hold it by one si de. It was as heavy as a \npiece of canvas. They squeezed it, twisting it at the end s until it regained its \nnatural weight. They turned over the mat and the sweat  came out of the other \nside. Aureliano was anxious for that operation never to  e n d .  H e  k n e w  t h e  \ntheoretical mechanics of love, but he could not stay on h is feet because of the \nweakness of his knees, and although he had goose pimples on his burning skin \nhe could not resist the urgent need to expel the weig ht of his bowels. When the \ngirl finished fixing up the bed and told him to get  undressed, he gave her a \nconfused explanation: “They made me come in. They told m e to throw twenty \ncents into the hopper and hurry up.” The girl understoo d his confusion. “If you \nthrow in twenty cents more when you go out, you can stay a little longer,” she \nsaid softly. Aureliano got undressed, tormented by shame,  unable to get rid of the \nidea that-his nakedness could not stand comparison with tha t of his brother. In \nspite of the girl’s efforts he felt more and more ind ifferent and terribly alone. “I’ll \nthrow in other twenty cents,” he said with a desolate v oice. The girl thanked him \nin silence. Her back was raw. Her skin was stuck to her ribs an d her breathing \nwas forced because of an immeasurable exhaustion. Two year s before, far away \nfrom there, she had fallen asleep without putting ou t the candle and had \nawakened surrounded by flames. The house where she live d with the grand-\nmother who had raised her was reduced to ashes. Since the n her grandmother \ncarried her from town to town, putting her to bed fo r twenty cents in order to make \nup the value of the burned house. According to the girl ’s calculations, she still had",
            "15": "ten years of seventy men per night, because she also had t o pay the expenses of \nthe trip and food for both of them as well as the pay of the Indians who carried the \nrocking chair. When the matron knocked on the door the second time, Aureliano \nleft the room without having done anything, troubled by a desire to weep. That \nnight he could not sleep, thinking about the girl, wi th a mixture of desire and pity. \nHe felt an irresistible need to love her and protect h er. At dawn, worn out by \ninsomnia and fever, he made the calm decision to marry her in order to free her \nfrom the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy al l the nights of satisfaction \nthat she would give the seventy men. But at ten o’clock i n the morning, when he \nreached Catarino’s store, the girl had left town. \nTime mitigated his mad proposal, but it aggravated hi s feelings of frustration. \nHe took refuge in work. He resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his \nlife in order to hide the shame of his uselessness. In the meantime, Melquíades \nhad printed on his plates everything that was printable  in Macondo, and he left \nthe daguerreotype laboratory to the fantasies of José Arca dio Buendía  who had \nresolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the exi stence of God. Through a \ncomplicated process of superimposed exposures taken in diffe rent parts of the \nhouse, he was sure that sooner or later he would get a  daguerreotype of God, if \nHe existed, or put an end once and for all to the sup position of His existence. \nMelquíades got deeper into his interpretations of Nost radamus. He would stay up \nuntil very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his tiny sparrow \nhands, whose rings had lost the glow of former times. O ne night he thought he \nhad found a prediction of the future of Macondo. It w as to be a luminous city with \ngreat glass houses where there was no trace remaining of the race of the \nBuendía. “It’s a mistake,” José Arcadio Buendía thundered . “They won’t be \nhouses of glass but of ice, as I dreamed, and there will  always be a Buendía, per \nomnia secula seculorum .” Úrsula fought to preserve common sense in that \nextravagant house, having broadened her business of litt le candy animals with an",

She had reached an age \nwhere she had a right to rest, but she was nonetheless mo re and more active. So \nbusy was she in her prosperous enterprises that one afterno on she looked \ndistractedly toward the courtyard while the Indian woman  helped her sweeten the \ndough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescent  girls doing frame \nembroidery in the light of the sunset. They were Rebeca and Amaranta. As soon \nas they had taken off the mourning clothes for their gra ndmother, which they \nwore with inflexible rigor for three years, their bri ght clothes seemed to have \ngiven them a new place in the world. Rebeca, contrary t o what might have been \nexpected, was the more beautiful. She had a light comp lexion, large and peaceful \neyes, and magical hands that seemed to work out the design  of the embroidery \nwith invisible threads. Amaranta, the younger, was some what graceless, but she \nhad the natural distinction, the inner tightness of her  dead grandmother. N ext to \nthem, although he was already revealing the physical dr ive of his father, Arcadio \nlooked like a child. He set about learning the art of  silverwork with Aureliano, who \nhad also taught him how to read and write. Úrsula sud denly realized that the \nhouse had become full of people, that her children wer e on the point of marrying \nand having children, and that they would be obliged  to scatter for lack of space. \nThen she took out the money she had accumulated over l ong years of hard labor, \nmade some arrangements with her customers, and undertoo k the enlargement of \nthe house. She had a formal parlor for visits built, a nother one that was more \ncomfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room with a table with twelve places \nwhere the family could sit with all of their guests, ni ne bedrooms with windows on \nthe courtyard and a long porch protected from the heat  of noon by a rose garden \nwith a railing on which to place pots of ferns and beg onias. She had the kitchen \nenlarged to hold two ovens. The granary where Pilar T ernera had read José",
            "17": "Arcadio’s future was torn down and another twice as lar ge built so that there \nwould never be a lack of food in the house. She had ba ths built is the courtyard in \nthe shade of the chestnut tree, one for the women an d another for the men, and \nin the rear a large stable, a fenced-in chicken yard, a shed for the milk cows, and \nan aviary open to the four winds so that wandering bird s could roost there at their \npleasure. Followed by dozens of masons and carpenters,  as if she had \ncontracted her husband’s hallucinating fever, Úrsula fi xed the position of light and \nheat and distributed space without the least sense of it s limitations. The primitive \nbuilding of the founders became filled with tools and  materials, of workmen \nexhausted by sweat, who asked everybody please not to molest them, \nexasperated by the sack of bones that followed them eve rywhere with its dull \nrattle. In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar , no one could see very well \nhow from the bowels of the earth there was rising not only the largest house is \nthe town, but the most hospitable and cool house that h ad ever existed in the \nregion of the swamp. José Buendía, trying to surprise Di vine Providence in the \nmidst of the cataclysm, was the one who least understood i t. The new house was \nalmost finished when Úrsula drew him out of his chimer ical world in order to \ninform him that she had an order to paint the front blue and not white as they had \nwanted. She showed him the official document. José Arca dio Buendía, without \nunderstanding what his wife was talking about, decipher ed the signature. \n“Who is this fellow?” he asked: \n“The magistrate,” Úrsula answered disconsolately. They say h e’s an \nauthority sent by the government.” \nDon Apolinar Moscote, the magistrate, had arrived in M acondo very quietly. \nHe put up at the Hotel Jacob—built by one of the first Arabs who came to swap \nknickknacks for macaws—and on the following day he rented a s mall room with a \ndoor on the street two blocks away from the Buendía house . He set up a table \nand a chair that he had bought from Jacob, nailed up on the wall the shield of the",
            "18": "republic that he had brought with him, and on the do or he painted the sign: \nMagistrate . His first order was for all the houses to be painted  blue in celebration \nof the anniversary of national independence. José Arcadio  Buendía, with the copy \nof the order in his hand, found him taking his nap in  a hammock he had set up in \nthe narrow office. “Did you write this paper?” he asked him. Don Apolinar \nMoscote, a mature man, timid, with a ruddy complexion, said yes. “By what \nright?” José Arcadio Buendía asked again. Don Apolinar M oscote picked up a \npaper from the drawer of the table and showed it to  h i m .  “ I  h av e  be en  n am e d \nmagistrate of this town.” José Arcadio Buendía did not e ven look at the \nappointment. \n“In this town we do not give orders with pieces of pape r,” he said without \nlosing his calm. “And so that you know it once and for al l, we don’t need any \njudge here because there’s nothing that needs judging.”  \nFacing Don Apolinar Moscote, still without raising his v oice, he gave a \ndetailed account of how they had founded the village, of how they had distributed \nthe land, opened the roads, and introduced the improv ements that necessity \nrequired without having bothered the government and  without anyone having \nbothered them. “We are so peaceful that none of us has died even of a natural \ndeath,” he said. “You can see that we still don’t have any cemetery.” No once was \nupset that the government had not helped them. On th e contrary, they were \nhappy that up until then it had let them grow in pe ace, and he hoped that it would \ncontinue leaving them that way, because they had not foun ded a town so that the \nfirst upstart who came along would tell them what to d o. Don Apolinar had put on \nhis denim jacket, white like his trousers, without losing at any moment the \nelegance of his gestures. \n“So that if you want to stay here like any other ordina ry citizen, you’re quite \nwelcome,” José Arcadio Buendía concluded. “But if you’ve co me to cause \ndisorder by making the people paint their houses blue, you can pick up your junk",
            "19": "and go back where you came from. Because my house is going to be white, \nwhite, like a dove.” \nDon Apolinar Moscote turned pale. He took a step backward  and tightened \nhis jaws as he said with a certain affliction: \n“I must warn you that I’m armed.” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía did not know exactly when his hands re gained the \nuseful strength with which he used to pull down horses. He grabbed Don Apolinar \nMoscote by the lapels and lifted him up to the level of his eyes. \n“I’m doing this,” he said, “because I would rather carry you around alive and \nnot have to keep carrying you around dead for the rest o f my life.” \nIn that way he carried him through the middle of the street, suspended by the \nlapels, until he put him down on his two feet on the swamp road. A week later he \nwas back with six barefoot and ragged soldiers, armed wit h shotguns, and an \noxcart in which his wife and seven daughters were trave ling. Two other carts \narrived later with the furniture, the baggage, and the household utensils. He \nsettled his family in the Hotel Jacob, while he looked fo r a house, and he went \nback to open his office under the protection of the sold iers. The founders of \nMacondo, resolving to expel the invaders, went with the ir older sons to put \nthemselves at the disposal of José Arcadio Buendía. But h e was against it, as he \nexplained, because it was not manly to make trouble for someone in front of his \nfamily, and Don Apolinar had returned with his wife a nd daughters. So he decided \nto resolve the situation in a pleasant way. \nAureliano went with him. About that time he had beg un to cultivate the black \nmustache with waxed tips and the somewhat stentorian vo ice that would \ncharacterize him in the war. Unarmed, without paying a ny attention to the guards, \nthey went into the magistrate’s office. Don Apolinar Mo scote did not lose his \ncalm. He introduced them to two of his daughters who h appened to be there: \nAmparo, sixteen, dark like her mother, and Remedios, on ly nine, a pretty little girl",
            "20": "with lily-colored skin and green eyes. They were gracious a nd well-mannered. As \nsoon as the men came in, before being introduced, they g ave them chairs to sit \non. But they both remained standing. \n“Very well, my friend,” José Arcadio Buendía said, “you ma y stay here, not \nbecause you have those bandits with shotguns at the door , but out of \nconsideration for your wife and daughters.” \nDon Apolinar Moscote was upset, but José Arcadio Buendía d id not give him \ntime to reply. “We only make two conditions,” he went on . “The first: that \neveryone can paint his house the color he feels like. The second: that the soldiers \nleave at once. We will guarantee order for you.” The magistrate raised his right \nhand with all the fingers extended. \n“Your word of honor?” \n“The word of your enemy,” José Arcadio Buendía said. And he added in a \nbitter tone: “Because I must tell you one thing: you and  I are still enemies.” \nThe soldiers left that same afternoon. A few days later José Arcadio Buendía \nfound a house for the magistrate’s family. Everybody was at peace except \nAureliano. The image of Remedios, the magistrate’s youn ger daughter, who, \nbecause of her age, could have been his daughter, kept paining him in some part \nof his body. It was a physical sensation that almost bothere d him when he \nwalked, like a pebble in his shoe."

            "0": "THE NEW HOUSE, white, like a dove, was inaugurated wi th a dance. Úrsula \nhad got that idea from the afternoon when she saw Re beca and Amaranta \nchanged into adolescents, and it could almost have been said that the main \nreason behind the construction was a desire to have a pro per place for the girls to \nreceive visitors. In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like \na galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that bef ore they were finished \nshe had ordered costly necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the \nmarvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishment of the town and the \njubilation of the young people: the pianola. They del ivered it broken down, packed \nin several boxes that were unloaded along with the Vi ennese furniture, the \nBohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Compa ny, the tablecloths \nfrom Holland, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks,  hangings and drapes. \nThe import house sent along at its own expense an Ital ian expert, Pietro Crespi, \nto assemble and tune the pianola, to instruct the purcha sers in its functioning, \nand to teach them how to dance the latest music printed on its six paper rolls. \nPietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and  well mannered \nman who had ever been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in h is dress that in spite \nof the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade ve st and heavy coat of dark \ncloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the \nhouse, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like \nthat of Aureliano in his silverwork. One morning, with out opening the door, \nwithout calling anyone to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola \nand the tormenting hammering and the constant noise of  wooden lathings ceased \nin a silence that was startled at the order and neatness of the music. They all ran \nto the parlor. José Arcadio Buendía was as if struck by ligh tning, not because of",
            "1": "the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic w orking of the keys of the \npianola, and he set up Melquíades’ camera with the ho pe of getting a \ndaguerreotype of the invisible player. That day the It alian had lunch with them. \nRebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidat ed by the way in which \nthe angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulate d the utensils. In the \nliving room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taugh t them how to dance. He \nshowed them the steps without touching them, keeping ti me with a metronome, \nunder the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did not leave th e room for a moment while \nher daughters had their lesson. Pietro Crespi wore speci al pants on those days, \nvery elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, “You don’t  have to worry so much,” \nJosé Arcadio Buendía told her. “The man’s a fairy.” But she did not leave off her \nvigilance until the apprenticeship was over and the It alian left Macondo. Then \nthey began to organize the party. Úrsula drew up a strict  guest list, in which the \nonly ones invited were the descendants of the founders, except for the family of \nPilar Ternera, who by then had had two more children by unknown fathers. It was \ntruly a high-class list, except that it was determined by feelings of friendship, for \nthose favored were not only the oldest friends of José A rcadio Buendía’s house \nsince before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also \ntheir sons and grandsons, who were the constant companions of Aureliano and \nArcadio since infancy, and their daughters, who were the only ones who visited \nthe house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta. Don Apolinar Moscote, the \nbenevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from his \nscanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. \nIn older to support the household expenses his daughter s had opened a sewing \nshop, where they made felt flowers as well as guava del icacies, and wrote love \nnotes to order. But in spite of being modest and hard- working, the most beautiful \ngirls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, th ey did not manage to be \nconsidered for the party.",
            "2": "While Úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished  silverware, and hung \npictures of maidens in boats full of roses, which gave a breath of new life to the \nnaked areas that the masons had built, José Arcadio Buendí a stopped his pursuit \nof the image of God, convinced of His nonexistence, and h e took the pianola \napart in order to decipher its magical secret. Two days b efore the party, swamped \nin a shower of leftover keys and hammers, bungling in th e midst of a mix-up of \nstrings that would unroll in one direction and roll up  a g a i n  i n  t h e  o t h e r ,  h e  \nsucceeded in a fashion in putting the instrument back tog ether. There had never \nbeen as many surprises and as much dashing about as in  those days, but the \nnew pitch lamps were lighted on the designated day a nd hour. The house was \nopened, still smelling of resin and damp whitewash, a nd the children and \ngrandchildren of the founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias, the quiet \nrooms, the garden saturated with the fragrance of the roses, and they gathered \ntogether in the parlor, facing the unknown invention  that had been covered with a \nwhite sheet. Those who were familiar with the piano,  popular in other towns in the \nswamp, felt a little disheartened, but more bitter wa s Úrsula’s disappointment \nwhen she put in the first roll so that Amaranta and R ebeca could begin the \ndancing and the mechanism did not work. Melquíades, a lmost blind by then, \ncrumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of his timel ess wisdom in an attempt to \nfix it. Finally José Arcadio Buendía managed, by mistake, to move a device that \nwas stuck and the music came out, first in a burst and then  in a flow of mixed-up \nnotes. Beating against the strings that had been put in  without order or concert \nand had been tuned with temerity, the hammers let go.  But the stubborn \ndescendants of the twenty-one intrepid people who plowe d through the \nmountains in search of the sea to the west avoided the reefs of the melodic mix-\nup and the dancing went on until dawn. \nPietro Crespi came back to repair the pianola. Rebeca an d Amaranta helped \nhim put the strings in order and helped him with thei r laughter at the mix-up of the",
            "3": "melodies. It was extremely pleasant and so chaste in its w ay that Úrsula ceased \nher vigilance. On the eve of his departure a farewell dance for him was \nimprovised with the pianola and with Rebeca he put o n a skillful demonstration of \nmodern dance, Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in gra ce and skill. But the \nexhibition was interrupted because Pilar Ternera, who w as at the door with the \nonlookers, had a fight, biting and hair pulling, with  a wom an wh o h ad dared to \ncomment that Arcadio had a woman’s behind. Toward midn ight Pietro Crespi \ntook his leave with a sentimental little speech, and he promised to return very \nsoon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and having cl osed up the house and \nput out the lamps, she went to her room to weep. It was an inconsolable weeping \nthat lasted for several days, the cause of which was not k nown even by \nAmaranta. Her hermetism was not odd. Although she seem ed expansive and \ncordial, she had a solitary character and an impenetrable  heart. She was a \nsplendid adolescent with long and firm bones, but she st ill insisted on using the \nsmall wooden rocking chair with which she had arrived a t the house, reinforced \nmany times and with the arms gone. No one had discovered that even at that age \nshe still had the habit of sucking her finger. That was w hy she would not lose an \nopportunity to lock herself in the bathroom and had acqu ired the habit of sleeping \nwith her face to the wall. On rainy afternoons, embroi dering with a group of \nfriends on the begonia porch, she would lose the threa d of the conversation and a \ntear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw t he strips of damp earth and \nthe piles of mud that the earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those secret \ntastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, br oke out into an \nirrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went b ack to eating earth. The \nfirst time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that  the bad taste would be the \nbest cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could no t bear the earth in her \nmouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxi ety, and little by little \nshe was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the",

S he would put handfuls of \nearth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without  being seen, with a \nconfused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the \nmost difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the \nsacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them. The \nhandfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of degradation less \nremote and more certain, as if the ground that he wal ked on with his fine patent \nleather boots in another part of the world were tran smitting to her the weight and \nthe temperature of his blood in a mineral savor that left a harsh aftertaste in her \nmouth and a sediment of peace in her heart. One after noon, for no reason, \nAmparo Moscote asked permission to see the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, \ndisconcerted by the unexpected visit, attended her with a stiff formality. They \nshowed her the remodeled mansion, they had her listen to the rolls on the \npianola, and they offered her orange marmalade and cr ackers. Amparo gave a \nlesson in dignity, personal charm, and good manners that  impressed Úrsula in \nthe few moments that she was present during the visit.  After two hours, when the \nconversation was beginning to wane, Amparo took advantag e of Amaranta’s \ndistraction and gave Rebeca a letter. She was able to se e the name of the \nEstimable Señorita Rebeca Buendía, written in the same  methodical hand, with \nthe same green ink, and the same delicacy of words with w hich the instructions \nfor the operation of the pianola were written, and she folded the letter with the tips \nof her fingers and hid it in her bosom, looking at Amp aro Moscote with an \nexpression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of \ncomplicity unto death. \nThe sudden friendship between Amparo Moscote and Rebe ca Buendía \nawakened the hopes of Aureliano. The memory of little Remedios had not \nstopped tormenting him, but he had not found a chance  to see her. When he \nwould stroll through town with his closest friends, Magn ífico Visbal and Gerineldo",

The \npresence of Amparo Moscote in the house was like a premoni tion. “She has to \ncome with her,” Aureliano would say to himself in a low  voice. “She has to come.” \nHe repeated it so many times and with such conviction tha t one afternoon when \nhe was putting together a little gold fish in the wo rk shop, he had the certainty that \nshe had answered his call. Indeed, a short time later he heard the childish voice, \nand when he looked up his heart froze with terror as h e saw the girl at the door, \ndressed in pink organdy and wearing white boots. \n“You can’t go in there, Remedios, Amparo Moscote said fr om the hall. \nThey’re working.” \nBut Aureliano did not give her time to respond. He p icked up the little fish by \nthe chain that came through its mouth and said to her. \n“Come in.” \nRemedios went over and asked some questions about the fis h that Aureliano \ncould not answer because he was seized with a sudden attack of asthma. He \nwanted to stay beside that lily skin forever, beside tho se emerald eyes, close to \nthat voice that called him “sir” with every question. sh owing the same respect that \nshe gave her father. Melquíades was in the corner seated  at the desk scribbling \nindecipherable signs. Aureliano hated him. All he could  do was tell Remedios that \nhe was going to give her the little fish and the girl  was so startled by the offer that \nshe left the workshop as fast as she could. That afternoo n Aureliano lost the \nhidden patience with which he had waited for a chance  to see her. He neglected \nhis work. In several desperate efforts of concentration he  willed her to appear but \nRemedios did not respond. He looked for her in her siste rs’ shop, behind the \nwindow shades in her house, in her father’s office, but  he found her only in the \nimage that saturated his private and terrible solitude .

            "6": "listening to it because it was the music with which Pietr o Crespi had taught them \nhow to dance. Aureliano listened to it simply because ev erything, even music, \nreminded him of Remedios. \nThe house became full of loves Aureliano expressed it in  poetry that had no \nbeginning or end. He would write it on the harsh pi eces of parchment that \nMelquíades gave him, on the bathroom walls, on the skin  of his arms, and in all of \nit Remedios would appear transfigured: Remedios in the  soporific air of two in the \nafternoon, Remedios in the soft breath of the roses, Re medios in the water-clock \nsecrets of the moths, Remedios in the steaming morning br ead, Remedios every-\nwhere and Remedios forever. Rebeca waited for her lov e at four in the afternoon, \nembroidering by the window. She knew that the mailma n’s mule arrived only \nevery two weeks, but she always waited for him, convinced th at he was going to \narrive on some other day by mistake. It happened quite the opposite: once the \nmule did not come on the usual day. Mad with desperati on, Rebeca got up in the \nmiddle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in th e garden with a suicidal drive, \nweeping with pain and fury, chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth \non snail shells. She vomited until dawn. She fell in to a state of feverish \nprostration, lost consciousness, and her heart went into a  shameless delirium. \nÚrsula, scandalized, forced the lock on her trunk and foun d at the bottom, tied \ntogether with pink ribbons, the sixteen perfumed let ters and the skeletons of \nleaves and petals preserved in old books and the dried butterflies that turned to \npowder at the touch. \nAureliano was the only one capable of understanding suc h desolation. That \nafternoon, while Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the slough of delirium, \nhe went with Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez t o Catarino’s store. The \nestablishment had been expanded with a gallery of woo den rooms where single \nwomen who smelled of dead flowers lived.

The three friends drank ferment ed cane juice. \nMagnífico and Gerineldo, contemporaries of Aureliano b ut more skilled in the \nways of the world, drank methodically with the women seat ed on their laps. One \nof the women, withered and with goldwork on her teet h, gave Aureliano a caress \nthat made him shudder. He rejected her. He had discove red that the more he \ndrank the more he thought about Remedios, but he could  bear the torture of his \nrecollections better. He did not know exactly when he be gan to float. He saw his \nfriends and the women sailing in a radiant glow, with out weight or mass, saying \nwords that did not come out of their mouths and making mysterious signals that \ndid not correspond to their expressions. Catarino put a  hand on his shoulder and \nsaid to him: “It’s going on eleven.” Aureliano turned  his head, saw the enormous \ndisfigured face with a felt flower behind the ear, an d then he lost his memory, as \nduring the times of forgetfulness, and he recovered it on a strange dawn and in a \nroom that was completely foreign, where Pilar Ternera stood in her slip, barefoot, \nher hair down, holding a lamp over him, startled wit h disbelief. \n“Aureliano!” \nAureliano checked his feet and raised his head. He did n ot know how he had \ncome there, but he knew what his aim was, because he had  carried it hidden \nsince infancy in an inviolable backwater of his heart. \n“I’ve come to sleep with you,” he said. \nHis clothes were smeared with mud and vomit.

She felt for Aurelia no in the darkness, put her \nhand on his stomach and kissed him on the neck with a mate rnal tenderness. “My \npoor child,” she murmured. Aureliano shuddered. With  a calm skill, without the \nslightest misstep, he left his accumulated grief behind a nd found Remedios \nchanged into a swamp without horizons, smelling of a ra w animal and recently \nironed clothes. When he came to the surface he was weepi ng. First they were \ninvoluntary and broken sobs. Then he emptied himself out  in an unleashed flow, \nfeeling that something swollen and painful had burst i nside of him. She waited, \nsnatching his head with the tips of her fingers, until his body got rid of the dark \nmaterial that would not let him live. They Pilar Ter nera asked him: “Who is it?” \nAnd Aureliano told her. She let out a laugh that in  other times frightened the \ndoves and that now did not even wake up the children . “You’ll have to raise her \nfirst,” she mocked, but underneath the mockery Aureliano found a reservoir of \nunderstanding. When he went out of the room, leaving  behind not only his doubts \nabout his virility but also the bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many \nmonths, Pilar Ternera made him a spontaneous promise. \n“I’m going to talk to the girl,” she told him, “and yo u’ll see what I’ll serve her \non the tray.” \nShe kept her promise. But it was a bad moment, because t he house had lost \nits peace of former days.

Weepin g with rage, she cursed \nthe day that it had occurred to her to buy the piano la, and she forbade the \nembroidery lessons and decreed a kind of mourning with n o one dead which was \nto be prolonged until the daughters got over their h opes. Useless was the \nintervention of José Arcadio Buendía, who had modified  his first impression of \nPietro Crespi and admired his ability in the manipulat ion of musical machines. So \nthat when Pilar Ternera told Aureliano that Remedio s had decided on marriage, \nhe could see that the news would only give his parents mo re trouble. Invited to \nthe parlor for a formal interview, José Arcadio Buendía  and Úrsula listened stonily \nto their son’s declaration. When he learned the name of the fiancée, however, \nJosé Arcadio Buendía grew red with indignation. “Love is a disease,” he \nthundered. “With so many pretty and decent girls around,  t h e  o n l y  t h i n g  t h a t  \noccurs to you is to get married to the daughter of our e nemy.” But Úrsula agreed \nwith the choice. She confessed her affection for the sev en Moscote sisters. for \ntheir beauty, their ability for work, their modesty, an d their good manners, and \nshe celebrated her son’s prudence. Conquered by his wife’s enthusiasm, José \nArcadio Buendía then laid down one condition: Rebeca, who was the one he \nwanted, would marry Pietro Crespi. Úrsula would take Am aranta on a trip to the \ncapital of the province when she had time, so that cont act with different people \nwould alleviate her disappointment. Rebeca got her he alth back just as soon as \nshe heard of the agreement, and she wrote her fiancé a jubilant letter that she \nsubmitted to her parents’ approval and put into the m ail without the use of any \nintermediaries. Amaranta pretended to accept the decisi on and little by little she \nrecovered from her fevers, but she promised herself that  Rebeca would marry \nonly over her dead body. \nThe following Saturday José Arcadio Buendía put on his d ark suit, his \ncelluloid collar, and the deerskin boots that he had wo rn for the first time the night \nof the party, and went to ask for the hand of Remedios Moscote.

In ord er to remove the mistake, \nthe mother woke Remedios up and carried her into the l iving room, still drowsy \nfrom sleep. They asked her if it was true that she had decided to get married, and \nshe answered, whimpering, that she only wanted them to let her sleep. José \nArcadio Buendía, understanding the distress of the Moscote s, went to clear \nthings up with Aureliano. When he returned, the Moscot es had put on formal \nclothing, had rearranged the furniture and put fresh flowers in the vases, and \nwere waiting in the company of their older daughters.  O v e r w h e l m e d  b y  t h e  \nunpleasantness of the occasion and the bothersome hard coll ar, José Arcadio \nBuendía confirmed the fact that Remedios, indeed, was t he chosen one. “It \ndoesn’t make sense,” Don Apolinar Moscote said with constern ation. “We have \nsix other daughters, all unmarried, and at an age wher e they deserve it, who \nwould be delighted to be the honorable wife of a ge ntleman as serious and hard-\nworking as your son, and Aurelito lays his eyes precisely on t he one who still \nwets her bed.” His wife, a well-preserved woman with a fflicted eyelids and \nexpression, scolded his mistake.

Intrigued, protesting that th ey were involving her in \nmen’s affairs, but really feeling deep emotion, Úrsul a went to visit her the next \nday. A half hour later she returned with the news tha t Remedios had not reached \npuberty. Aureliano did not consider that a serious barri er.

In \nreality, the only thing that could be isolated in the r ocky paragraphs was the \ninsistent hammering on the word equinox, equinox, equinox , and the name of \nAlexander von Humboldt. Arcadio got a little closer to  him when he began to help \nAureliano in his silverwork.

Don Ap olinar Moscote ventured to \nremind him that an unburied drowned man was a danger  to public health. “None \nof that, because he’s alive,” was the answer of José Arcadi o Buendía, who \nfinished the seventy-two hours with the mercurial incen se as the body was \nalready beginning to burst with a livid fluorescence, the  soft whistles of which \nimpregnated the house with a pestilential vapor. Only then did he permit them to \nbury him, not in any ordinary way, but with the honors reserved for Macondo’s \ngreatest benefactor. It was the first burial and the be st-attended one that was \never seen in the town, only surpassed, a century later, by Big Mama’s funeral \ncarnival.

The Italian, whose head covered with pate nt leather curls aroused in \nwomen an irrepressible need to sigh, dealt with Amaran ta as with a capricious \nlittle girl who was not worth taking seriously. \n“I have a younger brother,” he told her. “He’s coming to help me in the store.” \nAmaranta felt humiliated and told Pietro Crespi with  a virulent anger that she \nwas prepared to stop her sister’s wedding even if her o wn dead body had to lie",

It was an unnecessary precaution, for the Italia n had shown himself to \nbe so respectful that he did not even touch the hand of  the woman who was \ngoing to be his wife within the year. Those visits wer e filling the house with \nremarkable toys. Mechanical ballerinas, music boxes, acroba tic monkeys, trotting \nhorses, clowns who played the tambourine: the rich and st artling mechanical \nfauna that Pietro Crespi brought dissipated José Arcadio  Buendía’s affliction over \nthe death of Melquíades and carried him back to his old days as an alchemist. He \nlived at that time in a paradise of disemboweled ani mals, of mechanisms that had \nbeen taken apart in an attempt to perfect them with a  system of perpetual motion \nbased upon the principles of the pendulum. Aureliano, for his part, had neglected \nthe workshop in order to teach little Remedios to read and write.

She remembered a ba ld gentleman \ndressed in linen and with his collar closed by a gold bu tton, who had nothing to \ndo with the king of hearts. She remembered a very youn g and beautiful woman \nwith warm and perfumed hands, who had nothing in comm on with the jack of \ndiamonds and his rheumatic hands, and who used to put f lowers in her hair and \ntake her out walking in the afternoon through a town with green streets. \n“I don’t understand,” she said. \nPilar Ternera seemed disconcerted: \n“I don’t either, but that’s what the cards say.” \nRebeca was so preoccupied with the enigma that she told  it to José Arcadio \nBuendía, and he scolded her for believing in the predi ctions of the cards, but he \nundertook the silent task of searching closets and trunks, m oving furniture and \nturning over beds and floorboards looking for the bag  of bones. He remembered \nthat he had not seen it since the time of the rebuildi ng. He secretly summoned \nthe masons and one of them revealed that he had walle d up the bag in some \nbedroom because it bothered him in his work. After seve ral days of listening, with",
            "16": "their ears against the walls, they perceived the deep cloc-cloc . They penetrated \nthe wall and there were the bones in the intact bag. They buried it the same day \nin a grave without a stone next to that of Melquíade s, and José Arcadio Buendía \nreturned home free of a burden that for a moment ha d weighed on his conscience \nas much as the memory of Prudencio Aguilar. When he we nt through the kitchen \nhe kissed Rebeca on the forehead. \n“Get those bad thoughts out of your head,” he told her . “You’re going to be \nhappy.” \nThe friendship with Rebeca opened up to Pilar Terner a the doors of the \nhouse, closed by Úrsula since the birth of Arcadio. She would arrive at any hour \nof the day, like a flock of goats, and would unleash her  feverish energy in the \nhardest tasks. Sometimes she would go into the workshop an d help Arcadio \nsensitize the daguerreotype plates with an efficiency and  a tenderness that ended \nup by confusing him. That woman bothered him. The tan of her skin, her smell of \nsmoke, the disorder of her laughter in the darkroom dist racted his attention and \nmade him bump into things. \nOn a certain occasion Aureliano was there working on his silver, and Pilar \nTernera leaned over the table to admire his laboriou s patience. Suddenly it \nhappened. Aureliano made sure that Arcadio was in the  darkroom before raising \nhis eyes and meeting those of Pilar Ternera, whose thou ght was perfectly visible, \nas if exposed to the light of noon. \n“Well,” Aureliano said. “Tell me what it is.” \nPilar Ternera bit her lips with a sad smile. \n“That you’d be good in a war,” she said. “Where you put  your eye, you put \nyour bullet.” \nAureliano relaxed with the proof of the omen. He wen t back to concentrate \non his work as if nothing had happened, and his voice to ok on a restful strength. \n“I will recognize him,” he said. “He’ll bear my name.”",
            "17": "José Arcadio Buendía finally got what he was looking for : he connected the \nmechanism of the clock to a mechanical ballerina, and t he toy danced \nuninterruptedly to the rhythm of her own music for thr ee days. That discovery \nexcited him much more than any of his other harebrain ed undertakings. He \nstopped eating. He stopped sleeping. Only the vigilance and care of Rebeca kept \nhim from being dragged off by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium \nfrom which he would not recover. He would spend the n ights walking around the \nroom thinking aloud, searching for a way to apply the pr inciples of the pendulum \nto oxcarts, to harrows, to everything that was useful whe n put into motion. The \nfever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn  he could not recognize the \nold man with white hair and uncertain gestures who came  into his bedroom. It \nwas Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him,  startled that the dead also \naged, José Arcadio Buendía felt himself shaken by nostalgi a. “Prudencio,” he ex-\nclaimed. “You’ve come from a long way off!” After many years of death the \nyearning for the living was so intense, the need for comp any so pressing, so \nterrifying the neatness of that other death which exists within death, that \nPrudencio Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy. He had spent a great \ndeal of time looking for him. He asked the dead from R iohacha about him, the \ndead who came from the Upar Valley, those who came from  the swamp, and no \none could tell him because Macondo was a town that was u nknown to the dead \nuntil Melquíades arrived and marked it with a small b lack dot on the motley maps \nof death. José Arcadio Buendía conversed with Prudencio A guilar until dawn. A \nfew hours later, worn out by the vigil, he went into  Aureliano’s workshop and \nasked him: “What day is today?” Aureliano told him that it was Tuesday. “I was \nthinking the same thing,” José Arcadio Buendía said, “bu t suddenly I realized that \nit’s still Monday, like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the  walls, look at the \nbegonias. Today is Monday too.” Used to his manias, Aurel iano paid no attention \nto him. On the next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Buendía went back to the",
            "18": "workshop. “This is a disaster,” he said. “Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of \nthe sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today i s Monday too.” That \nnight Pietro Crespi found him on the porch, weeping for Prudencio Aguilar, for \nMelquíades, for Rebeca’s parents, for his mother and fat her, for all of those he \ncould remember and who were now alone in death. He g ave him a mechanical \nbear that walked on its hind legs on a tightrope, but he could not distract him from \nhis obsession. He asked him what had happened to the pr oject he had explained \nto him a few days before about the possibility of buildi ng a pendulum machine \nthat would help men to fly and he answered that it wa s impossible because a \npendulum could lift anything into the air but it could  not lift itself. On Thursday he \nappeared in the workshop again with the painful look of plowed ground. “The time \nmachine has broken,” he almost sobbed, “and Úrsula and Amaranta so far away!” \nAureliano scolded him like a child and he adopted a con trite air. He spent six \nhours examining things, trying to find a difference fr om their appearance on the \nprevious day in the hope of discovering in them some ch ange that would reveal \nthe passage of time. He spent the whole night in bed w ith his eyes open, calling \nto Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquíades, to all the dead , so that they would share his \ndistress. But no one came. On Friday. before anyone arose,  he watched the \nappearance of nature again until he did not have the  slightest doubt but that it \nwas Monday. Then he grabbed the bar from a door and w ith the savage violence \nof his uncommon strength he smashed to dust the equipmen t in the alchemy \nlaboratory, the daguerreotype room, the silver workshop , shouting like a man \npossessed in some high-sounding and fluent but completely incomprehensible \nlanguage. He was about to finish off the rest of the house when Aureliano asked \nthe neighbors for help. Ten men were needed to get h im down, fourteen to tie him \nup, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the cou rtyard, where they left him \ntied up, barking in the strange language and giving o ff a green froth at the mouth. \nWhen Úrsula and Amaranta returned he was still tied t o the trunk of the chestnut",
            "19": "tree by his hands and feet, soaked with rain and in a state of total innocence. \nThey spoke to him and he looked at them without recogni zing them, saying things \nthey did not understand. Úrsula untied his wrists and ankl es, lacerated by the \npressure of the rope, and left him tied only by the wa ist. Later on they built him a \nshelter of palm brandies to protect him from the sun a nd the rain."

            "0": "AURELIANO BUENDÍA and Remedios Moscote were married on e Sunday \nin March before the altar Father Nicanor Reyna had set  u p in  th e parl or. It was  \nthe culmination of four weeks of shocks in the Moscote house hold because little \nRemedios had reached puberty before getting over the habits of childhood. In \nspite of the fact that her mother had taught her abou t the changes of \nadolescence, one February afternoon she burst shouting i nto the living room, \nwhere her sisters were chatting with Aureliano, and sho wed them her panties, \nsmeared with a chocolate-colored paste. A month for the  wedding was agreed \nupon. There was barely enough time to teach her how to  wash herself, get \ndressed by herself, and understand the fundamental busin ess of a home. They \nmade her urinate over hot bricks in order to cure her o f the habit of wetting her \nbed. It took a good deal of work to convince her of the  inviolability of the marital \nsecret, for Remedios was so confused and at the same time so  am az ed at th e \nrevelation that she wanted to talk to everybody about  the details of the wedding \nnight. It was a fatiguing effort, but on the date set  for the ceremony the child was \nas adept in the ways of the world as any of her sisters. Do n Apolinar Moscote \nescorted her by the arm down the street that was decorate d with flowers and \nwreaths amidst the explosion of rockets and the music of several bands, and she \nwaved with her hand and gave her thanks with a smile t o those who wished her \ngood luck from the windows. Aureliano, dressed in black, w earing the same \npatent leather boots with metal fasteners that he woul d have on a few years later \nas he faced the firing squad, had an intense paleness and  a  h a r d  l u m p  i n  h i s \nthroat when he met the bride at the door of the hou se and led her to the altar. \nShe behaved as naturally, with such discretion, that sh e did not lose her \ncomposure, not even when Aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her",
            "1": "finger. In the midst of the. murmurs and confusion of t he guests, she kept her arm \nwith the fingerless lace glove held up and remained like  that with her ring finger \nready until the bridegroom managed to stop the ring w ith his foot before it rolled \nto the door, and came back blushing to the altar. Her  mother and sisters suffered \nso much from the fear that the child would do somethi ng wrong during the \nceremony that in the end they were the ones who committe d the impertinence of \npicking her up to kiss her. From that day on the sense of responsibility, the \nnatural grace, the calm control that Remedios would hav e in the face of adverse \ncircumstances was revealed. It was she who, on her own init iative, put aside the \nlargest piece that she had cut from the wedding cake an d took it on a plate with a \nfork to José Arcadio Buendía. Tied to the trunk of the c hestnut tree, huddled on a \nwooden stool underneath the palm shelter, the enormo us old man, discolored by \nthe sun and rain, made a vague smile of gratitude a nd at the piece of cake with \nhis fingers, mumbling an unintelligible psalm. The onl y unhappy person in that \nnoisy celebration, which lasted until dawn on Monday, wa s Rebeca Buendía. It \nwas her own frustrated party. By an arrangement of Úrsu la’s, her marriage was to \nbe celebrated on the same day, but that Friday Pietro C respi received a letter \nwith the news of his mother’s imminent death. The wedd ing was postponed. \nPietro Crespi left for the capital of the province an hour after receiving the letter, \nand on the road he missed his mother, who arrived punct ually Saturday night and \nat Aureliano’s wedding sang the sad aria that she had prepared for the wedding \nof her son. Pietro Crespi returned on Sunday midnight to sweep up the ashes of \nthe party, after having worn out five horses on the roa d in an attempt to be in time \nfor his wedding. It was never discovered who wrote the letter. Tormented by \nÚrsula, Amaranta wept with indignation and swore her innocence in front of the \naltar, which the carpenters had not finished dismantl ing. \nFather Nicanor Reyna—whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brou ght from the \nswamp to officiate at the wedding—was an old man harden ed by the ingratitude",
            "2": "of his ministry. His skin was sad, with the bones almost exp osed, and he had a \npronounced round stomach and the expression of an old angel, which came more \nfrom, simplicity than from goodness. He had planned to return to his pariah after \nthe wedding, but he was appalled at the hardness of th e inhabitants of Macondo, \nwho were prospering in the midst of scandal, subject to the natural law, without \nbaptizing their children or sanctifying their festivals. Thinking that no land needed \nthe seed of God so much, he decided to stay on for anot her week to Christianize \nboth circumcised and gentile, legalize concubinage, an d give the sacraments to \nthe dying. But no one paid any attention to him. They would answer him that they \nhad been many years without a priest, arranging the bus iness of their souls \ndirectly with God, and that they had lost the evil of o riginal sin. Tired of preaching \nin the open, Father Nicanor decided to undertake the b uilding of a church, the \nlargest in the world, with life-size saints and stained- glass windows on the sides, \nso that people would come from Rome to honor God in t he center of impiety. He \nwent everywhere begging alms with a copper dish. They g ave him a large \namount, but he wanted more, because the church had t o have a bell that would \nraise the drowned up to the surface of the water. He pleaded so much that he lost \nhis voice. His bones began to fill with sounds. One Satur day, not even having \ncollected the price of the doors, he fell into a despera te confusion. He improvised \nan altar in the square and on Sunday he went through the town with a small bell, \nas in the days of insomnia, calling people to an open-ai r mass. Many went out of \ncuriosity. Others from nostalgia. Others so that God woul d not take the disdain for \nHis intermediary as a personal insult. So that at eight  in the morning half the town \nwas in the square, where Father Nicanor chanted the go spels in a voice that had \nbeen lacerated by his pleading. At the end, when the co ngregation began to \nbreak up, he raised his arms signaling for attention. \n“Just a moment,” he said. “Now we shall witness an undeni able proof of the \ninfinite power of God.”",
            "3": "The boy who had helped him with the mass brought him a  cup of thick and \nsteaming chocolate, which he drank without pausing to breathe. Then he wiped \nhis lips with a handkerchief that he drew from his sleeve , extended his arms, and \nclosed his eyes. Thereupon Father Nicanor rose six inches ab ove the level of the \nground. It was a convincing measure. He went among th e houses for several \ndays repeating the demonstration of levitation by mean s of chocolate while the \nacolyte collected so much money in a bag that in less than a month he began the \nconstruction of the church. No one doubted the divine origin of the demonstration \nexcept José Arcadio Buendía, who without changing expr ession watched the \ntroop of people who gathered around the chestnut tre e one morning to witness \nthe revelation once more. He merely stretched on his sto ol a little and shrugged \nhis shoulders when Father Nicanor began to rise up fro m the ground along with \nthe chair he was sitting on. \n“Hoc est simplicissimus ,” José Arcadio Buendía said. “ Homo iste statum \nquartum materiae invenit .” \nFather Nicanor raised his hands and the four legs of the  chair all landed on \nthe ground at the same time. “ Nego ,” he said. “ Factum hoc existentiam Dei \nprobat sine dubio .” \nThus it was discovered that José Arcadio Buendía’s devilish  jargon was \nLatin. Father Nicanor took advantage of the circumstance  of h i s bein g th e on l y \nperson who had been able to communicate with him to tr y to inject the faith into \nhis twisted mind. Every afternoon he would sit by the ch estnut tree preaching in \nLatin, but José Arcadio Buendía insisted on rejecting rh etorical tricks and the \ntransmutation of chocolate, and he demanded the dague rreotype of God as the \nonly proof. Father Nicanor then brought him medals and  pictures and even a \nreproduction of the Veronica, but José Arcadio Buendía r ejected them as artistic \nobjects without any scientific basis. He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor gave \nup his attempts at evangelization and continued visiti ng him out of humanitarian",
            "4": "feelings. But then it was José Arcadio Buendía who took t he lead and tried to \nbreak down the priest’s faith with rationalist tricks. On a certain occasion when \nFather Nicanor brought a checker set to the chestnut tre e and invited him to a \ngame, José Arcadio Buendía would not accept, because accordi ng to him he \ncould never understand the sense of a contest in which t he two adversaries have \nagreed upon the rules. Father Nicanor, who had never seen checkers played that \nway, could not play it again. Ever more startled at José  Arcadio Buendía’s \nlucidity, he asked him how it was possible that they had hi m tied to a tree. \n“Hoc est simplicissimus ,” he replied. “Because I’m Crazy.” \nFrom then on, concerned about his own faith, the priest  did not come back to \nvisit him and dedicated himself to hurrying along the building of the church. \nRebeca felt her hopes being reborn. Her future was pre dicated on the completion \nof the work, for one Sunday when Father Nicanor was lun ching at the house and \nthe whole family sitting at the table spoke of the solem nity and splendor that \nreligious ceremonies would acquire when the church was b uilt, Amaranta said: \n“The luckiest one will be Rebeca.” And since Rebeca did n ot understand what \nshe meant, she explained it to her with an innocent smi le: \n“You’re going to be the one who will inaugurate the  church with your \nwedding.” \nRebeca tried to forestall any comments. The way the constr uction was going \nthe church would not be built before another ten yea rs. Father Nicanor did not \nagree: the growing generosity of the faithful permitt ed him to make more \noptimistic calculations. To the mute Indignation of Reb eca, who could not finish \nher lunch, Úrsula celebrated Amaranta’s idea and contr ibuted a considerable sum \nfor the work to move faster. Father Nicanor felt that with another contribution like \nthat the church would be ready within three years. Fro m then on Rebeca did not \nsay another word to Amaranta, convinced that her initia tive had not the innocence \nthat she attempted to give it. “That was the least seri ous thing I could have done,”",
            "5": "Amaranta answered her during the violent argument the y had that night. “In that \nway I won’t have to kill you for three years.” Rebeca accep ted the challenge. \nWhen Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponeme nt, he went through \na crisis of disappointment, but Rebeca gave him a final proof of her loyalty. “We’ll \nelope whenever you say,” she told him. Pietro Crespi, ho wever, was not a man of \nadventure. He lacked the impulsive character of his fi ancée and he considered \nrespect for one’s given word as a wealth that should no t be squandered. Then \nRebeca turned to more audacious methods. A mysterious wind  b l e w  o u t  t h e  \nlamps in the parlor and Úrsula surprised the lovers k issing in the dark. Pietro \nCrespi gave her some confused explanations about the poo r quality of modern \npitch lamps and he even helped her install a more secur e system of illumination \nfor the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks b ecame clogged and Úrsula \nfound Rebeca sitting on her fiancé’s lap. This time she  would accept no \nexplanation. She turned the responsibility of the bake ry over to the Indian woman \nand sat in a rocking chair to watch over the young people  during the visits, ready \nto win out over maneuvers that had already been old w hen she was a girl. “Poor \nMama,” Rebeca would say with mock indignation, seeing Úr sula yawn during the \nboredom of the visits. “When she dies she’ll go off to her reward in that rocking \nchair.” After three months of supervised love, fatigued by the slow progress of the \nconstruction, which he went to inspect every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give \nFather Nicanor the money he needed to finish the chur ch. Amaranta did not grow \nimpatient. As she conversed with her girl friends every afternoon when they came \nto embroider on the porch, she tried to think of new subterfuges. A mistake in \ncalculation spoiled the one she considered the most effe ctive: removing the \nmothballs that Rebeca had put in her wedding dress befo re she put it away in the \nbedroom dresser. She did it when two months were left for the completion of the \nchurch. But Rebeca was so impatient with the approach o f the wedding that she \nwanted to get the dress ready earlier than Amaranta ha d foreseen. When she",
            "6": "opened the dresser and unfolded first the papers and th en the protective cloth, \nshe found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the  veil and even the crown \nof orange blossoms perforated by moths. Although she was sure that she had put \na handful of mothballs in the wrappings, the disaster se emed so natural that she \ndid not dare blame Amaranta. There was less than a mon th until the wedding, but \nAmparo Moscote promised to sew a new dress within a week. Amaranta felt faint \nthat rainy noontime when Amparo came to the house wrap ped in the froth of \nneedlework for Rebeca to have the final fitting of the  dress. She lost her voice \nand a thread of cold sweat ran down the path of her sp ine. For long months she \nhad trembled with fright waiting for that hour, beca use if she had not been able to \nconceive the ultimate obstacle to Rebeca’s wedding, she w as sure that at the last \nmoment, when all the resources of her imagination had failed, she would have \nthe courage to poison her. That afternoon, while Rebe ca was suffocating with \nheat inside the armor of thread that Amparo Moscote wa s putting about her body \nwith thousands of pins and infinite patience, Amaranta made several mistakes in \nher crocheting and pricked her finger with the needle , but she decided with \nfrightful coldness that the date would be the last Fri day before the wedding and \nthe method would be a dose of laudanum in her coffee.  \nA greater obstacle, as impassable as it was unforeseen, obl iged a new and \nindefinite postponement. One week before the date set for the wedding, little \nRemedios woke up in the middle of the night soaked in a hot broth which had \nexploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch,  and she died three days later, \npoisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed i n her stomach. \nAmarante suffered a crisis of conscience. She had begged God with such fervor \nfor something fearful to happen so that she would not  have to poison Rebeca that \nshe felt guilty of Remedios’ death. That was not the o bstacle that she had begged \nfor so much. Remedios had brought a breath of merrime nt to the house. She had \nsettled down with her husband in a room near the worksh op, which she",
            "7": "decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood , and her merry vitality \noverflowed the four walls of the bedroom and went li ke a whirlwind of good health \nalong the porch with the begonias: She would start sin ging at dawn. She was the \nonly person who dared intervene in the arguments betwee n Rebeca and \nAmaranta. She plunged into the fatiguing chore of ta king care of José Arcadio \nBuendía. She would bring him his food, she would help  him with his daily \nnecessities, wash him with soap and a scrubbing brush, keep  his hair and beard \nfree of lice and nits, keep the palm shelter in good co ndition and reinforce it with \nwaterproof canvas in stormy weather. In her last months sh e had succeeded in \ncommunicating with him in phrases of rudimentary Latin. When the son of \nAureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house and baptized in \nan intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano José, Reme dios decided that he \nwould be considered their oldest child. Her maternal i nstinct surprised Úrsula. \nAureliano, for his part, found in her the justificatio n that he needed to live. He \nworked all day in his workshop and Remedios would bring h im a cup of black \ncoffee in the middle of the morning. They would both visit the Moscotes every \nnight. Aureliano would play endless games of dominoes wi th his father-in-law \nwhile Remedios chatted with her sisters or talked to h er mother about more \nimportant things. The link with the Buendías consolidate d Don Apolinar Moscote’s \nauthority in the town. On frequent trips to the capita l of the province he \nsucceeded in getting the government to build a school so  that Arcadio, who had \ninherited the educational enthusiasm of his grandfath er, could take charge of it. \nThrough persuasion he managed to get the majority of houses painted blue in \ntime for the date of national independence. At the u rging of Father Nicanor, he \narranged for the transfer of Catarino’s store to a back street and he closed down \nseveral scandalous establishments that prospered in the cen ter of town. Once he \nreturned with six policemen armed with rifles to whom he entrusted the \nmaintenance of order, and no one remembered the ori ginal agreement not to",
            "8": "have armed men in the town. Aureliano enjoyed his fat her-in-law’s efficiency. \n“You’re going to get as fat as he is,” his friends would  say to him. But his \nsedentary life, which accentuated his cheekbones and concent rated the sparkle \nof his eyes, did not increase his weight or alter the par simony of his character, \nbut, on the contrary, it hardened on his lips the straig ht line of solitary meditation \nand implacable decision. So deep was the affection that he and his wife had \nsucceeded in arousing in both their families that when Remedios announced that \nshe was going to have a child. even Rebeca and Amarant a declared a truce in \norder to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink wool in case it was \na girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought about a  few years later when he \nfaced the firing squad. \nÚrsula ordered a mourning period of closed doors and w indows, with no one \nentering or leaving except on matters of utmost necessity. She prohibited any \ntalking aloud for a year and she put Remedios’ daguer reotype in the place where \nher body had been laid out, with a black ribbon around  it and an oil lamp that was \nalways kept lighted. Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, would be \npuzzled at that girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, an d with an organdy band \naround her head, and they were never able to connect  her with the standard \nimage of a great-grandmother. Amaranta took charge o f Aureliano José. She \nadopted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her from the \ninvolutary laudanum that her mad beseeching had throw n into Remedios’ coffee. \nPietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribb on on his hat, and he would \npay a silent visit to Rebeca, who seemed to be bleeding t o death inside the black \ndress with sleeves down to her wrists. Just the idea of t hinking about a new date \nfor the wedding would have been so irreverent that th e engagement turned into \nan eternal relationship, a fatigued love that no on e worried about again, as if the \nlovers, who in other days had sabotaged the lamps in ord er to kiss, had been",
            "9": "abandoned to the free will of death. Having lost her bearings, completely \ndemoralized, Rebeca began eating earth again. \nSuddenly—when the mourning had gone on so long that th e needlepoint \nsessions began again—someone pushed open the street door a t two in the \nafternoon in the mortal silence of the heat and the braces in the foundation shook \nwith such force that Amaranta and her friends sewing o n the porch, Rebeca \nsucking her finger in her bedroom, Úrsula in the kitch en, Aureliano in the \nworkshop, and even José Arcadio Buendía under the solitar y chestnut tree had \nthe impression that an earthquake was breaking up the ho use. A huge man had \narrived. His square shoulders barely fitted through the doorways. He was wearing \na medal of Our Lady of Help around his bison neck, his ar ms and chest were \ncompletely covered with cryptic tattooing, and on his righ t wrist was the tight \ncopper bracelet of the niños-en-cruz amulet. His skin was tanned by the salt of \nthe open air, his hair was short and straight like the mane of a mule, his jaws \nwere of iron, and he wore a sad smile. He had a belt on that was twice as thick as \nthe cinch of a horse, boots with leggings and spurs and i ron on the heels, and his \npresence gave the quaking impression of a seismic tremor.  H e wen t th rou gh  th e \nparlor and the living room, carrying some half-worn sad dlebags in his hand, and \nhe appeared like a thunderclap on the porch with the  begonias where Amaranta \nand her friends were paralyzed, their needles in the a ir. “Hello,” he said to them in \na tired voice, threw the saddlebags on a worktable, and  went by on his way to the \nback of the house. “Hello,” he said to the startled Rebe cca, who saw him pass by \nthe door of her bedroom. “Hello,” he said to Aurelia no, who was at his \nsilversmith’s bench with all five senses alert. He did n ot linger with anyone. He \nwent directly to the kitchen and there he stopped for th e first time at the end of a \ntrip that had begun of the other side of the world. “Hello,” he said. Úrsula stood for \na fraction of a second with her mouth open, looked int o his eyes, gave a cry, and \nflung her arms around his neck, shouting and weeping wit h joy. It was José",
            "10": "Arcadio. He was returning as poor as when he had left, to such an extreme that \nÚrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the rental of his horse. He spoke a \nSpanish that was larded with sailor slang. They asked whe re he had been and he \nanswered: “Out there.” He hung his hammock in the room they assigned him and \nslept for three days. When he woke up, after eating six teen raw eggs, he went \ndirectly to Catarino’s store, where his monumental size p rovoked a panic of \ncuriosity among the women. He called for music and cane liquor for everyone, to \nbe put on his bill. He would Indian-wrestle with five  men at the same time. “It can’t \nbe done,” they said, convinced that they would not be a ble to move his arm. “He \nhas niños-en-cruz .” Catarino, who did not believe in magical tricks of st rength, bet \nhim twelve pesos that he could not move the counter. José Arcadio pulled it out \nof its place, lifted it over his head, and put it in the street. It took eleven men to \nput it back. In the heat of the party he exhibited his u nusual masculinity on the \nbar, completely covered with tattoos of words in several languages intertwined in \nblue and red. To the women who were besieging him an d coveting him he put the \nquestion as to who would pay the most. The one who had the most money \noffered him twenty pesos. Then he proposed raffling him self off among them at \nten pesos a chance. It was a fantastic price because the mo st sought-after wom-\nan earned eight pesos a night, but they all accepted. Th ey wrote their names on \nfourteen pieces of paper which they put into a hat and  each woman took one out. \nWhen there were only two pieces left to draw, it was est ablished to whom they \nbelonged. \n“Five pesos more from each one,” José Arcadio proposed, “ and I’ll share \nmyself with both. \nHe made his living that way. He had been around the wo rld sixty-five times, \nenlisted in a crew of sailors without a country. The wome n who went to bed with \nhim that night in Catarino’s store brought him naked into the dance salon so that \npeople could see that there was not a square inch of hi s body that was not",

He slept all da y and spent the night in the \nred-light district, making bets on his strength. On the r are occasions when Úrsula \ngot him to sit down at the table, he gave signs of rad iant good humor, especially \nwhen he told about his adventures in remote countries. He had been shipwrecked \nand spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feedin g on the body of a \ncomrade who had succumbed to sunstroke and whose extreme ly salty flesh as it \ncooked in the sun had a sweet and granular taste. Under  a bright noonday sun in \nthe Gulf of Bengal his ship had killed a sea dragon, in the stomach of which they \nfound the helmet, the buckles, and the weapons of a Cru sader. In the Caribbean \nhe had seen the ghost of the pirate ship of Victor Hugu es, with its sails torn by the \nwinds of death, the masts chewed by sea worms, and still l ooking for the course \nto Guadeloupe. Úrsula would weep at the table as if s he were reading the letters \nthat had never arrived and in which José Arcadio told a bout his deeds and \nmisadventures. “And there was so much of a home here fo r you, my son,” she \nwould sob, “and so much food thrown to the hogs!” But  u n d e r n e a t h  i t  a n  s h e  \ncould not conceive that the boy the gypsies took away was th e same lout who \nwould eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose fla tulence withered the flowers. \nSomething similar took place with the rest of the famil y. Amaranta could not \nconceal the repugnance that she felt at the table because  of his bestial belching. \nArcadio, who never knew the secret of their relationship , scarcely answered the \nquestions that he asked with the obvious idea of gaining his affection. Aureliano \ntried to relive the times when they slept in the same r oom, tried to revive the \ncomplicity of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten ab out it, because life at \nsea had saturated his memory with too many things to rem ember. Only Rebeca \nsuccumbed to the first impact. The day that she saw him p ass by her bedroom \nshe thought that Pietro Crespi was a sugary dandy next to  that protomale whose \nvolcanic breathing could be heard all over the house. S he tried to get near him",
            "12": "under any pretext. On a certain occasion José Arcadio looke d at her body with \nshameless attention and said to her “You’re a woman, li ttle sister.” Rebeca lost \ncontrol of herself. She went back to eating earth and t he whitewash on the walls \nwith the avidity of previous days, and she sucked her fing er with so much anxiety \nthat she developed a callus on her thumb. She vomite d up a green liquid with \ndead leeches in it. She spent nights awake shaking with fever, fighting against \ndelirium, waiting until the house shook with the retu rn of José Arcadio at dawn. \nOne afternoon, when everyone was having a siesta, she co uld no longer resist \nand went to his bedroom. She found him in his shorts,  lying in the hammock that \nhe had hung from the beams with a ship’s hawser. She was so impressed by his \nenormous motley nakedness that she felt an impulse to ret reat. “Excuse me,” she \nsaid, “I didn’t know you were here.” But she lowered he r voice so as not to wake \nanyone up. “Come here,” he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stop ped beside the \nhammock in an icy sweat, feeling knots forming in her int estines, while José \nArcadio stroked her ankles with the tips of his fingers, t hen her calves, then her \nthighs, murmuring: “Oh, little sister, little sister.” S he had to make a supernatural \neffort not to die when a startlingly regulated cyclonic p ower lifted her up by the \nwaist and despoiled her of her intimacy with three clash es of its claws and \nquartered her like a little bird. She managed to tha nk God for having been born \nbefore she lost herself in the inconceivable pleasure o f that unbearable pain, \nsplashing in the steaming marsh of the hammock which a bsorbed the explosion \nof blood like a blotter. \nThree days later they were married during the five-o’cl ock mass. José \nArcadio had gone to Pietro Crespi’s store the day before . He found him giving a \nzither lesson and did not draw him aside to speak to him . “I’m going to marry \nRebeca,” he told him. Pietro Crespi turned pale, gave  th e  z i th e r  t o  on e  o f  h i s \npupils, and dismissed the class. When they were alone in t he room that was \ncrowded with musical instruments and mechanical toys, Piet ro Crespi said:",
            "13": "“She’s your sister.” \n“I don’t care,” José Arcadio replied. \nPietro Crespi mopped his brow with the handkerchief th at was soaked in \nlavender. \n“It’s against nature,” he explained, “and besides, it’s against the law.” \nJosé Arcadio grew impatient, not so much at the argumen t as over Pietro \nCrespi’s paleness. \n“Fuck nature two times over,” he said. “And I’ve come to  tell you not to \nbother going to ask Rebeca anything.” \nBut his brutal deportment broke down when he saw Pietr o Crespi’s eyes \ngrow moist. \n“Now,” he said to him in a different tone, “if you re ally like the family, there’s \nAmaranta for you.” \nFather Nicanor revealed in his Sunday sermon that José Ar cadio and \nRebeca were not brother and sister. Úrsula never forga ve what she considered \nan inconceivable lack of respect and when they came back from  c h u r c h  s h e  \nforbade the newlyweds to set foot in the house again. F or her it was as if they \nwere dead. So they rented a house across from the cemete ry and established \nthemselves there with no other furniture but José Arcad io’s hammock. On their \nwedding night a scorpion that had got into her slipper  bit Rebeca on the foot. Her \ntongue went to sleep, but that did not stop them from  spending a scandalous \nhoneymoon. The neighbors were startled by the cries that  woke up the whole \ndistrict as many as eight times in a single night and thre e times during siesta, and \nthey prayed that such wild passion would not disturb the peace of the dead. \nAureliano was the only one who was concerned about them.  H e  b o u g h t  \nthem some furniture and gave them some money until José Arcadio recovered \nhis sense of reality and began to work the no-man’s-land that bordered the \ncourtyard of the house. Amaranta, on the other hand, n ever did overcome her",

He still wore t he black ribbon on his hat as \na sign of respect for the family, and he took pleasure i n showing his affection for \nÚrsula by bringing her exotic gifts: Portuguese sardines , Turkish rose marmalade, \nand on one occasion a lovely Manila shawl. Amaranta lo oked after him with a \nloving diligence. She anticipated his wants, pulled out  the threads on the cuffs of \nhis shirt, and embroidered a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his birthday. \nOn Tuesdays, after lunch, while she would embroider o n the porch, he would \nkeep her happy company. For Pietro Crespi, that woman wh om he always had \nconsidered and treated as a child was a revelation. Al though her temperament \nlacked grace, she had a rare sensibility for appreciating the things of the world \nand had a secret tenderness. One Tuesday, when no one dou bted that sooner or \nlater it had to happen, Pietro Crespi asked her to mar ry him. She did not stop her \nwork. She waited for the hot blush to leave her ears and gave her voice a serene \nstress of maturity. \n“Of course, Crespi,” she said. “But when we know each othe r better. It’s \nnever good to be hasty in things.” \nÚrsula was confused. In spite of the esteem she had for P ietro Crespi, she \ncould not tell whether his decision was good or bad fro m the moral point of view \nafter his prolonged and famous engagement to Rebeca. B ut she finally accepted \nit as an unqualified fact because no one shared her dou bts. Aureliano, who was \nthe man of the house, confused her further with his eni gmatic and final opinion: \n“These are not times to go around thinking about wedd ings.” \nThat opinion, which Úrsula understood only some months l ater, was the only \nsincere one that Aureliano could express at that moment,  not only with respect to \nmarriage, but to anything that was not war. He himself , facing a firing squad,",
            "15": "would not understand too well the concatenation of the  series of subtle but \nirrevocable accidents that brought him to that point. T he death of Remedios had \nnot produced the despair that he had feared. It was, r ather, a dull feeling of rage \nthat grades ally dissolved in a solitary and passive frustra tion similar to the one \nhe had felt during the time he was resigned to living  w i t h o u t  a  w o m a n .  H e  \nplunged into his work again, but he kept up the custom of playing dominoes with \nhis father-in-law. In a house bound up in mourning, t he nightly conversations \nconsolidated the friendship between the two men. “Get  m arri ed agai n .

The \nLiberals were determined to go to war. Since Aurelia no at that time had very \nconfused notions about the difference between Conservati ves and Liberals, his \nfather-in-law gave him some schematic lessons. The Libera ls, he said, were \nFreemasons, bad people, wanting to hang priests, to inst itute civil marriage and \ndivorce, to recognize the rights of illegitimate child ren as equal to those of \nlegitimate ones, and to cut the country up into a feder al system that would take \npower away from the supreme authority. The Conservativ es, on the other hand, \nwho had received their power directly from God, propose d the establishment of \npublic order and family morality. They were the defende rs of the faith of Christ, of \nthe principle of authority, and were not prepared to  permit the country to be \nbroken down into autonomous entities. Because of his hum anitarian feelings \nAureliano sympathized with the Liberal attitude with  respect to the rights of \nnatural children, but in any case, he could not underst and how people arrived at \nthe extreme of waging war over things that could not be touched with the hand. It \nseemed an exaggeration to him that for the elections his father-in-law had them \nsend six soldiers armed with rifles under the command of  a sergeant to a town \nwith no political passions. They not only arrived, but they went from house to",
            "16": "house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kit chen knives before \nthey distributed among males over twenty-one the blue b allots with the names of \nthe Conservative candidates and the red ballots with th e names of the Liberal \ncandidates. On the eve of the elections Don Apolinar Mo scote himself read a \ndecree that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages a nd the gathering together \nof more than three people who were not of the same f amily. The elections took \nplace without incident. At eight o’clock on Sunday mornin g a wooden ballot box \nwas set up in the square, which was watched over by the si x soldiers. The voting \nwas absolutely free, as Aureliano himself was able to att est since he spent almost \nthe entire day with his father-in-law seeing that no o ne voted more than once. At \nfour in the afternoon a roll of drums in the square a nnounced the closing of the \npolls and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box w ith a label crossed by his \nsignature. That night, while he played dominoes with A ureliano, he ordered the \nsergeant to break the seal in order to count the votes.  There were almost as \nmany red ballots as blue, but the sergeant left only ten  red ones and made up the \ndifference with blue ones. Then they sealed the box aga in with a new label and \nthe first thing on the following day it was taken to th e capital of the province. “The \nLiberals will go to war,” Aureliano said. Don Apolina r concentrated on his domino \npieces. “If you’re saying that because of the switch in bal lots, they won’t,” he said. \n“We left a few red ones in so there won’t be any compla ints.” Aureliano \nunderstood the disadvantages of being in the opposition . “If I were a Liberal,” he \nsaid, “I’d go to war because of those ballots.” His fathe r-in-law looked at him over \nhis glasses. \n“Come now, Aurelito,” he said, “if you were a Liberal , even though you’re my \nson-in-law, you wouldn’t have seen the switching of the ballots.” \nWhat really caused indignation in the town was. not the  results of the \nelections but the fact that the soldiers had not returne d the weapons. A group of \nwomen spoke with Aureliano so that he could obtain the  return of their kitchen",
            "17": "knives from his father-in-law. Don Apolinar Moscote expl ained to him, in strictest \nconfidence, that the soldiers had taken the weapons off a s proof that the Liberals \nwere preparing for war. The cynicism of the remark ala rmed him. He said nothing, \nbut on a certain night when Gerineldo Márquez and Ma gnífico Visbal were \nspeaking with some other friends about the incident of t he knives, they asked him \nif he was a Liberal or a Conservative. Aureliano did not hesitate. \n“If I have to be something I’ll be a Liberal,” he sai d, “because the \nConservatives are tricky.” \nOn the following day, at the urging of his friends, he  went to see Dr. Alirio \nNoguera to be treated for a supposed pain in his liver . He did not even \nunderstand the meaning of the subterfuge. Dr. Alirio Noguera had arrived in \nMacondo a few years before with a medicine chest of taste less pills and a \nmedical motto that convinced no one: One nail draws another . In reality he was a \ncharlatan. Behind his innocent façade of a doctor withou t prestige there was \nhidden a terrorist who with his short legged boots cove red the scars that five \nyears in the stocks had left on his legs. Taken prisoner duri ng the first federalist \nadventure, he managed to escape to Curaçao disguised in the garment he \ndetested most in this world: a cassock. At the end of a pr olonged exile, stirred up \nby the exciting news that exiles from all over the Cari bbean brought to Curaçao, \nhe set out in a smuggler’s schooner and appeared in Ri ohacha with the bottles of \npills that were nothing but refined sugar and a dip loma from the University of \nLeipzig that he had forged himself. He wept with disa ppointment. The federalist \nfervor, which the exiles had pictured as a powder keg a bout to explode, had \ndissolved into a vague electoral illusion. Embittered b y failure, yearning for a safe \nplace where he could await old age, the false homeopat h took refuge in \nMacondo. In the narrow bottle-crowded room that he re nted on one side of the \nsquare, he lived several years off the hopelessly ill who , after having tried \neverything, consoled themselves with sugar pills. His inst incts of an agitator",
            "18": "remained dormant as long as Don Apolinar Moscote was a f igurehead. He \npassed the time remembering and fighting against asthma . The  approach of the \nelections was the thread that led him once more to the skein of subversion. He \nmade contact with the young people in the town, who l acked political knowledge, \nand he embarked on a stealthy campaign of instigation. T he numerous red ballots \nthat appeared is the box and that were attributed by Don Apolinar Moscote to the \ncuriosity that came from youth were part of his plan: he  made his disciples vote in \norder to show them that elections were a farce. “The on ly effective thing,” he \nwould say, “is violence.” The majority of Aureliano’s fri ends were enthusiastic \nover the idea of liquidating the Conservative establi shment, but no one had dared \ninclude him in the plans, not only because of his ties wi th the magistrate, but \nbecause of his solitary and elusive character. It was known , furthermore, that he \nhad voted blue at his father-in-law’s direction. So it  was a simple matter of chance \nthat he revealed his political sentiments, and it was pu rely a matter of curiosity, a \ncaprice, that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain that he did \nnot have. In the den that smelled of camphorated cobwe bs he found himself \nfacing a kind of dusty iguana whose lungs whistled when h e breathed. Before \nasking him any questions the doctor took him to the window  an d ex ami ned th e \ninside of his lower eyelid. “It’s not there,” Aureliano  said, following what they told \nhim. He pushed the tips of his fingers into his liver a nd added: “Here’s where I \nhave the pain that won’t let me sleep.” Then Dr. No guera closed the window with \nthe pretext that there was too much sun, and explain ed to him in simple terms \nthat it was a patriotic duty to assassinate Conservatives. For several days \nAureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his shirt  pocket. He would take it out \nevery two hours, put three pills in the palm of his han d, and pop them into his \nmouth for them to be slowly dissolved on his tongue. Don  Apolinar Moscote made \nfun of his faith in homeopathy, but those who were in on the plot recognized \nanother one of their people in him. Almost all of th e sons of the founders were",
            "19": "implicated, although none of them knew concretely what action they were \nplotting. Nevertheless, the day the doctor revealed the  secret to Aureliano, the \nlatter elicited the whole plan of the conspiracy. Altho ugh he was convinced at that \ntime of the urgency of liquidating the Conservative r egime, the plot horrified him. \nDr. Noguera had a mystique of personal assassination. His system was reduced \nto coordinating a series of individual actions which in one master stroke covering \nthe whole nation would liquidate the functionaries of  th e regim e al ong wi th  th ei r \nrespective families, especially the children, in order to  exterminate Conservatism \nat its roots. Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters, needless to \nsay, were on the list. \n“You’re no Liberal or anything else,” Aureliano told  h i m  w i t h o u t  g e t t i n g  \nexcited. “You’re nothing but a butcher.” \n“In that case,” the doctor replied with equal calm, “gi ve me back the bottle. \nYou don’t need it any more.” \nOnly six months later did Aureliano learn that the doct or had given up on him \nas a man of action because he was a sentimental person wit h no future, with a \npassive character, and a definite solitary vocation. They tried to keep him \nsurrounded, fearing that he would betray the conspiracy. Aureliano calmed them \ndown: he would not say a word, but on the night they w ent to murder the Moscote \nfamily they would find him guarding the door. He show ed such a convincing deci-\nsion that the plan was postponed for an indefinite dat e. It was during those days \nthat Úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage betwe en Pietro Crespi and \nAmaranta, and he answered that these were not times t o be thinking about such \na thing. For a week he had been carrying an old-fashi oned pistol under his shirt. \nHe kept his eyes on his friends. In the afternoon he woul d go have coffee with \nJosé Arcadio and Rebeca, who had begun to put their hou se in order, and from \nseven o’clock on he would play dominoes with his father-i n-law. At lunchtime he \nwas chatting with Arcadio, who was already a huge adolesce nt, and he found him",
            "20": "more and more excited over the imminence of war. In sc hool, where Arcadio had \npupils older than himself mixed in with children who were barely beginning to talk, \nthe Liberal fever had caught on. There was talk of sho oting Father Nicanor, of \nturning the church into a school, of instituting free  love. Aureliano tried to calm \ndown his drive. He recommended discretion and prudence t o him. Deaf to his \ncalm reasoning, to his sense of reality, Arcadio reproache d him in public for his \nweakness of character. Aureliano waited. Finally, in the  beginning of December, \nÚrsula burst into the workshop all upset. \n“War’s broken out!” \nWar, in fact, had broken out three months before. Mart ial law was in effect in \nthe whole country. The only one who knew it immediate ly was Don Apolinar \nMoscote, but he did not give the news even to his wife while the army platoon \nthat was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way. They entered noiselessly \nbefore dawn, with two pieces of light artillery drawn by mules, and they set up \ntheir headquarters in the school. A",

They dragged out Dr. N oguera, tied him to a \ntree in the square, and shot him without any due proce ss of law. Father Nicanor \ntried to impress the military authorities with the mira cle of levitation and had his \nhead split open by the butt of a soldier’s rifle. The L iberal exaltation had been \nextinguished into a silent terror. Aureliano, pale, mysterious, continued playing \ndominoes with his father-in-law. He understood that in  spite of his present title of \ncivil and military leader of the town, Don Apolinar Mo scote was once more a \nfigurehead. The decisions were made by the army captain,  w h o  e a ch  m o rn i n g \ncollected an extraordinary levy for the defense of publi c order. Four soldiers \nunder his command snatched a woman who had been bitte n by a mad dog from \nher family and killed her with their rifle butts. One  Sunday, two weeks after the \noccupation, Aureliano entered Gerineldo Márquez’s house and with his usual",

When t he two of them were \nalone in the kitchen, Aureliano gave his voice an auth ority that had never been \nheard before. “Get the boys ready,” he said. “We’re goi ng to war.” Gerineldo \nMárquez did not believe him. \n“With what weapons?” he asked. \n“With theirs,” Aureliano replied. \nTuesday at midnight in a mad operation, twenty-one me n under the age of \nthirty commanded by Aureliano Buendía, armed with tab le knives and sharpened \ntools, took the garrison by surprise, seized the weapons, and in the courtyard \nexecuted the captain and the four soldiers who had kill ed the woman. \nThat same night, while the sound of the firing squad co uld be heard, Arcadio \nwas named civil and military leader of the town. The ma rried rebels barely had \ntime to take leave of their wives, whom they left to t heir our devices. They left at \ndawn, cheered by the people who had been liberated f rom the terror, to join the \nforces of the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, wh o, according to the latest \nreports, was on his way to Manaure. Before leaving, Aur eliano brought Don \nApolinar Moscote out of a closet. “Rest easy, father-in-l aw,” he told him. “The new \ngovernment guarantees on its word of honor your persona l safety and that of your \nfamily.” Don Apolinar Moscote had trouble identifying t hat conspirator in high \nboots and with a rifle slung over his shoulder with the  person he had played \ndominoes with until nine in the evening. \n“This is madness, Aurelito,” he exclaimed. \n“Not madness,” Aureliano said. “War.

            "0": "COLONEL AURELIANO BUENDÍA organized thirty-two armed  uprisings and \nhe lost them all. He had seventeen male children by sev enteen different women \nand they were exterminated one after the other on a single night before the oldest \none had reached the age of thirty-five. He survived fourteen attempts on his life, \nseventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad. He lived th rough a dose of \nstrychnine in his coffee that was enough to kill a horse. He refused the Order of \nMerit, which the President of the Republic awarded him . He rose to be \nCommander in Chief of the revolutionary forces, with j urisdiction and command \nfrom one border to the other, and the man most feare d by the government, but he \nnever let himself be photographed. He declined the l ifetime pension offered him \nafter the war and until old age he made his living fr om the little gold fishes that he \nmanufactured in his workshop in Macondo. Although he alw ays fought at the \nhead of his men, the only wound that he received was th e one he gave himself \nafter signing the Treaty of Neerlandia, which put an end to almost twenty years of \ncivil war. He shot himself in the chest with a pistol an d the bullet came out \nthrough his back without damaging any vital organ. The o nly thing left of all that \nwas a street that bore his name in Macondo. And yet, as h e declared a few years \nbefore he died of old age, he had not expected any of  th at on  the dawn  h e l eft \nwith his twenty-one men to join the forces of General V ictorio Medina. \n“We leave Macondo in your care.” was all that he said to  Arcadio before \nleaving. “We leave it to you in good shape, try to ha ve it in better shape when we \nreturn.” \nArcadio gave a very personal interpretation to the inst ructions. He invented a \nuniform with the braid and epaulets of a marshal, insp ired by the prints in one of \nMelquíades’ books, and around his waist he buckled the sa ber with gold tassels",
            "1": "that had belonged to the executed captain. He set up the two artillery pieces at \nthe entrance to town, put uniforms on his former pupil s, who had been amused by \nhis fiery proclamations, and let them wander through th e streets armed in order to \ngive outsiders an impression of invulnerability. It was a double-edged deception, \nfor the government did not dare attack the place for ten months, but when it did it \nunleashed such a large force against it that resistance was liquidated in a half \nhour. From the first day of his rule Arcadio revealed h is predilection for decrees. \nHe would read as many as four a day in order to decree a nd institute everything \nthat came into his head. He imposed obligatory military service for men over \neighteen, declared to be public property any animals wal king the streets after six \nin the evening, and made men who were overage wear r ed armbands. He \nsequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pa in of execution and \nprohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells un less it was for a Liberal \nvictory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a \nfiring squad organized in the square and had it shoot  at a scarecrow. At first no \none took him seriously. They were, after all, schoolchildr en playing at being \ngrown-ups. But one night, when Arcadio went into Cata rino’s store, the trumpeter \nin the group greeted him with a fanfare that made t he customers laugh and \nArcadio had him shot for disrespect for the authorities.  People who protested \nwere put on bread and water with their ankles in a se t of stocks that he had set \nup in a schoolroom. “You murderer!” Úrsula would shou t at him every time she \nlearned of some new arbitrary act. “When Aureliano fin ds out he’s going to shoot \nyou and I’ll be the first one to be glad.” But it was of no use. Arcadio continued \ntightening the tourniquet with unnecessary rigor until  he became the cruelest ruler \nthat Macondo had ever known. “Now let them suffer th e difference,” Don Apolinar \nMoscote said on one occasion. “This is the Liberal paradi se.” Arcadio found out \nabout it. At the head of a patrol he assaulted the ho use, destroyed the furniture, \nflogged the daughters, and dragged out Don Apolinar Moscote. When Úrsula",

That \nway I won’t have the eyes to weep for the shame of ha ving raised a monster.” \nWhipping him without mercy, she chased him to the back o f the courtyard, where \nArcadio curled up like a snail in its shell. Don Apolin ar Moscote was unconscious, \ntied to the post where previously they had had the scare crow that had been cut to \npieces by shots fired in fun. The boys in the squad scatter ed, fearful that Úrsula \nwould go after them too. But she did not even look a t them. She left Arcadio with \nhis uniform torn, roaring with pain and rage, and sh e untied Don Apolinar \nMoscote and took him home. Before leaving the headquar ters she released the \nprisoners from the stocks. \nFrom that time on she was the one who ruled in the t own. She reestablished \nSunday masses, suspended the use of red armbands, and abro gated the \nharebrained decrees. But in spite of her strength, she still wept over her \nunfortunate fate. She felt so much alone that she so ught the useless company of \nher husband, who had been forgotten under the chestnu t tree. “Look what we’ve \ncome to,” she would tell him as the June rains threaten ed to knock the shelter \ndown. “Look at the empty house, our children scattered a ll over the world, and the \ntwo of us alone again, the same as in the beginning.” José Arcadio Buendía, sunk \nin an abyss of unawareness, was deaf to her lamentations. At the beginning of \nhis madness he would announce his daily needs with urgent Latin phrases. In \nfleeting clear spells of lucidity, when Amaranta would bring him his meals he \nwould tell her what bothered him most and would accept  her sucking glasses and \nmustard plasters in a docile way.

Then she decided to lie to  h im . ‘R ou  won ’ t bel i ev e \nwhat I’m going to tell you,” she said as she threw ash es over his excrement in \norder to pick it up with the shovel. “God willed that José Arcadio and Rebeca \nshould get married, and now they’re very happy.” She g ot to be so sincere in the \ndeception that she ended up by consoling herself with h er own lies. “Arcadio is a \nserious man now,” she said, “and very brave, and a fine- looking young man with \nhis uniform and saber.” It was like speaking to a dead m an, for José Arcadio \nBuendía was already beyond the reach of any worry. But she  insisted. He \nseemed so peaceful, so indifferent to everything that sh e decided to release him. \nHe did not even move from his stool.

It was a twilight engagement. The Italian wou ld arrive at dusk, with a \ngardenia in his buttonhole, and he would translate P etrarch’s sonnets for \nAmaranta.

They had put together \na delightful album with the postcards that Pietro Cresp i received from Italy. They \nwere pictures of lovers in lonely parks, with vignettes of  hearts pierced with \narrows and golden ribbons held by doves. “I’ve been to this park in Florence,” \nPietro Crespi would say, going through the cards. “A per son can put out his hand \nand the birds will come to feed.” Sometimes, over a wa tercolor of Venice, \nnostalgia would transform the smell of mud and putref ying shellfish of the canals \ninto the warm aroma of flowers.

When Úrsula ordered the revival of \nSunday mass, Pietro Crespi donated a German harmonium t o the church, \norganized a children’s chorus, and prepared a Gregori an repertory that added a \nnote of splendor to Father Nicanor’s quiet rite.

The rigor \nof the mourning for Remedios had been relegated to t he background by the \nmortifications of the war, Aureliano’s absence, Arcadio’s brutality, and the \nexpulsion of José Arcadio and Rebeca. With the imminence of the wedding, \nPietro Crespi had hinted that Aureliano José, in whom he had stirred up a love \nthat was almost filial, would be considered their oldest  child. Everything made \nAmaranta think that she was heading toward a smooth hap piness. But unlike \nRebeca, she did not reveal the slightest anxiety. With the same patience with \nwhich she dyed tablecloths, sewed lace masterpieces, and e mbroidered \nneedlepoint peacocks, she waited for Pietro Crespi to be unable to bear the urges \nof his heart and more. Her day came with the ill-fated  October rains.

She withdrew \nhers like a timid little animal and went back to her wo rk. \n“Don’t be simple, Crespi.” She smiled. “I wouldn’t mar ry you even if I were \ndead.” \nPietro Crespi lost control of himself. He wept shamelessl y, almost breaking \nhis fingers with desperation, but he could not break her  down. “Don’t waste your \ntime,” was all that Amaranta said. “If you really love me so much, don’t set foot in \nthis house again.” Úrsula thought she would go mad w ith shame. Pietro Crespi \nexhausted all manner of pleas. He went through incredib le extremes of \nhumiliation.

He would spend the day in the rear of the st ore writing wild notes, \nwhich he would send to Amaranta with flower petals an d dried butterflies, and \nwhich she would return unopened. He would shut himsel f up for hours on end to \nplay the zither. One night he sang. Macondo woke up in a  kind of angelic stupor \nthat was caused by a zither that deserved more than this world and a voice that \nled one to believe that no other person on earth coul d feel such love. Pietro \nCrespi then saw the lights go on in every window in town  except that of \nAmaranta. On November second, All Souls’ Day, his broth er opened the store \nand found all the lamps lighted, all the music boxes o pened, and all the docks \nstriking an interminable hour, and in the midst of tha t mad concert he found Pietro \nCrespi at the desk in the rear with his wrists cut by a raz or and his hands thrust \ninto a basin of benzoin. \nÚrsula decreed that the wake would be in her house.

Amaranta did not leave her bedroom. From h er bed she heard Úrsula’s \nweeping, the steps and whispers of the multitude that i nvaded the house, the \nwailing of the mourners, and then a deep silence that smelled of trampled \nflowers. For a long time she kept on smelling Pietro C respi’s lavender breath at \ndusk, but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium . Úrsula abandoned her. \nShe did not even raise her eyes to pity her on the afte rnoon when Amaranta went \ninto the kitchen and put her hand into the coals of th e stove until it hurt her so \nmuch that she felt no more pain but instead smelled the pestilence of her own",

The \nonly external trace that the tragedy left was the banda ge of black gauze that she \nput on her burned hand and that she wore until her d eath. \nArcadio gave a rare display of generosity by decreeing off icial mourning for \nPietro Crespi. Úrsula interpreted it as the return of  the strayed lamb. But she was \nmistaken. She had lost Arcadio, not when he had put on his military uniform, but \nfrom the beginning. She thought she had raised him a s a son, as she had raised \nRebeca, with no privileges or discrimination. Neverthele ss, Arcadio was a solitary \nand frightened child during the insomnia plague, in the midst of Úrsula’s utilitarian \nfervor, during the delirium of José Arcadio Buendía, t he hermetism of Aureliano, \nand the mortal rivalry between Amaranta and Rebeca. A ureliano had taught him \nto read and write, thinking about other things, as he would have done with a \nstranger. He gave him his clothing so that Visitación co uld take it in when it was \nready to be thrown away. Arcadio suffered from shoes tha t were too large, from \nhis patched pants, from his female buttocks. He never succeed ed in \ncommunicating with anyone better than he did with Visit ación and Cataure in their \nlanguage. Melquíades was the only one who really was conce rned with him as he \nmade him listen to his incomprehensible texts and gave h im lessons in the art of \ndaguerreotype. No one imagined how much he wept in se cret and the \ndesperation with which he tried to revive Melquíades w ith the useless study of his \npapers. The school, where they paid attention to him a nd respected him, and \nthen power, with his endless decrees and his glorious unif orm, freed him from the \nweight of an old bitterness. One night in Catarino’s st ore someone dared tell him, \n“you don’t deserve the last name you carry.” Contrary to w hat everyone expected, \nArcadio did not have him shot. \n“To my great honor,” he said, “I am not a Buendía.”",

Pilar Ternera, his \nmother, who had made his blood boil in the darkroom, was as much an irresistible \nobsession for him as she had been first for José Arcadio an d then for Aureliano. \nIn spite of her having lost her charms and the splendor of her laugh, he sought \nher out and found her by the trail of her smell of sm oke. A short time before the \nwar, one noon when she was later than usual in coming  for her younger son at \nschool, Arcadio was waiting for her in the room where h e was accustomed to take \nhis siesta and where he later set up the stocks. While the child played in the \ncourtyard, he waited in his hammock, trembling with anxi ety, knowing that Pillar \nTernera would have to pass through there. She arrive d.

Suddenly, when anxie ty had broken down \ninto rage, the door opened. A few months later, facin g the firing squad, Arcadio \nwould relive the wandering steps in the classroom, the st umbling against \nbenches, and finally the bulk of a body in the shadows o f the room and the \nbreathing of air that was pumped by a heart that was n ot his.

Then he realized that this was no t the woman he was \nwaiting for, because she did not smell of smoke but of flower lotion, and she had \ninflated, blind breasts with nipples like. a man’s, a se x as stony and round as a \nnut, and the chaotic tenderness of excited inexperience.  She was a virgin and \nshe had the unlikely name of Santa Sofía de la Piedad.  P il ar Ternera had pai d \nher fifty pesos, half of her life savings, to do what she was doing.

All day long she would embroider beside the wi ndow, withdrawn from \nthe uneasiness of the war, until the ceramic pots would  begin to vibrate in the \ncupboard and she would get up to warm the meal, much  before the appearance, \nfirst, of the mangy hounds, and then of the colossus in l eggings and spurs with a \ndouble-barreled shotgun, who sometimes carried a dee r on his shoulder and \nalmost always a string of rabbits or wild ducks. One aftern oon, at the beginning of \nhis rule, Arcadio paid them a surprise visit. They had not seen him since they had \nleft the house, but he seemed so friendly and familiar that they invited him to \nshare the stew. \nOnly when they were having coffee did Arcadio reveal th e motive behind his \nvisit: he had received a complaint against José Arcadio. It was said that he had \nbegun by plowing his own yard and had gone straight ahe ad into neighboring \nlands, knocking down fences and buildings with his oxen un til he took forcible \npossession of the best plots of land around. On the peasan ts whom he had not \ndespoiled because he was not interested in their lands, h e levied a contribution \nwhich he collected every Saturday with his hunting dogs a nd his double-barreled \nshotgun. He did not deny it. He based his right on the fact that the usurped lands \nhad been distributed by José Arcadio Buendía at the time  of the founding, and he \nthought it possible to prove that his father had been cr azy ever since that time, for \nhe had disposed of a patrimony that really belonged to the family. It was an \nunnecessary allegation, because Arcadio had not come to do  justice. He simply \noffered to set up a registry office so that José Arcadio cou ld legalize his title to the \nusurped land, under the condition that he delegate t o the local government the \nright to collect the contributions. They made an agreeme nt. Years later, when \nColonel Aureliano Buendía examined the titles to pro perty, he found registered in \nhis brother’s name all of the land between the hill w here his yard was on up to the \nhorizon, including the cemetery, and discovered that duri ng the eleven months of \nhis rule, Arcadio had collected not only the money of the  contributions, but had",

At first she \nsuspected it. “Arcadio is building a house,” she confided with feigned pride to her \nhusband as she tried to put a spoonful of calabash syrup into his mouth. \nNevertheless, she involuntarily sighed and said, “I don’t know why, but all this has \na bad smell to me.” Later on, when she found out tha t Arcadio had not only built a \nhouse but had ordered some Viennese furniture, she confi rmed her suspicion that \nhe was using public funds. “You’re the shame of our fa mily name,” she shouted at \nhim one Sunday after mass when she saw him in his new ho use playing cards \nwith his officers. Arcadio paid no attention to her. On ly then did Úrsula know that \nhe had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofí a de la Piedad, with whom \nhe was living outside of marriage, was pregnant again.  She decided to write to \nColonel Aureliano Buendía, wherever he was, to bring  h i m  u p  t o  d a t e  o n  t h e  \nsituation. But the fast-moving events of those days not o nly prevented her plans \nfrom being carried out, they made her regret having co nceived them. The war, \nwhich until then had been only a word to designate a vague and remote \ncircumstance, became a concrete and dramatic reality. Around  the end of Febru-\nary an old woman with an ashen look arrived in Macondo  riding a donkey loaded \ndown with brooms. She seemed so inoffensive that the sen tries let her pass \nwithout any questions as another vendor, one of the man y who often arrived from \nthe towns in the swamp. She went directly to the barracks.  Arcadio received her \nin the place where the classroom used to be and which at  th at tim e h ad been \ntransformed into a kind of rearguard encampment, with roiled hammocks hanging \non hooks and mats piled up in the corners, and rifles and  carbines and even \nhunting shotguns scattered on the floor. The old woman stiffened into a military \nsalute before identifying herself:",

Colonel Aurelian o Buendía, whom he had \nleft fighting in retreat near Riohacha, had given h im a message for Arcadio. He \nshould surrender the town without resistance on the con dition that the lives and \nproperty of Liberals would be respected. Arcadio examined  that strange \nmessenger who could have been a fugitive grandmother w ith a look of pity. \n“You have brought something in writing, naturally,” h e said. \n“Naturally,” the emissary answered, “I have brought noth ing of the sort. It’s \neasy to understand that under the present circumstances a person can’t carry \nanything that would compromise him.” \nAs he was speaking he reached into his bodice and took ou t a small gold \nfish. “I think that this will be sufficient,” he said. Arcadio could see that indeed it \nwas one of the little fishes made by Colonel Aureliano  Buendía. But anyone could \nhave bought it before the war or stolen it, and it h ad no merit as a safe-conduct \npass. The messenger even went to the extreme of violati ng a military secret so \nthat they would believe his identity. He revealed that  he was on a mission to \nCuraçao, where he hoped to recruit exiles from all ove r the Caribbean and \nacquire arms and supplies sufficient to attempt a land ing at the end of the year. \nWith faith in that plan, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was not in favor of any useless \nsacrifices at that time. But Arcadio was inflexible. He ha d the prisoner put into the \nstocks until he could prove his identity and he resolved t o defend the town to the \ndeath. \nHe did not have long to wait. The news of the Libera l defeat was more and \nmore concrete. Toward the end of March, before a dawn of premature rain, the \ntense calm of the previous weeks was abruptly broken by the desperate sounds \nof a cornet and a cannon shot that knocked down the steep le of the church. \nActually, Arcadio’s decision to resist was madness. He had on ly fifty poorly armed",
            "13": "men with a ration of twenty cartridges apiece. But amon g them, his former pupils, \nexcited by the high-sounding proclamations, the determi nation reigned to \nsacrifice their skins for a lost cause. In the midst of the t ramping of boots, \ncontradictory commands, cannon shots that made the earth t remble, wild \nshooting, and the senseless sound of cornets, the supposed  Colonel Stevenson \nmanaged to speak to Arcadio. “Don’t let me undergo the  indignity of dying in the \nstocks in these women’s clothes,” he said to him. “If I have  t o  d i e ,  l e t  m e  d i e \nfighting.” He succeeded in convincing him. Arcadio ord ered them to give him a \nweapon and twenty cartridges, and he left him with fiv e men to defend \nheadquarters while he went off with his staff to head up the resistance. He did not \nget to the road to the swamp. The barricades had been broken and the defenders \nwere openly fighting in the streets, first until they use d up their ration of rifle \nbullets, then with pistols against rifles, and finally ha nd to hand. With the \nimminence of defeat, some women went into the street a rmed with sticks and \nkitchen knives. In that confusion Arcadio found Amaranta , who was looking for \nhim like a madwoman, in her nightgown and with two o ld pistols that had \nbelonged to José Arcadio Buendía. He gave his rifle to  an officer who had been \ndisarmed in the fight and escaped with Amaranta throug h a nearby street to take \nher home. Úrsula was, in the doorway waiting, indiffer ent to the cannon shots that \nhad opened up a hole in the front of the house next  door. The rain was letting up, \nbut the streets were as slippery and as smooth as melted soa p, and one had to \nguess distances in the darkness. Arcadio left Amaranta with  Úrsula and made an \nattempt to face two soldiers who had opened up with he avy firing from the corner. \nThe old pistols that had been kept for many years in the  bureau did not work. \nProtecting Arcadio with her body, Úrsula tried to drag him toward the house. \n“Come along in the name of God,” she shouted at him . “There’s been \nenough madness!” \nThe soldiers aimed at them.",
            "14": "“Let go of that man, ma’am,” one of them shouted, “ or we won’t be \nresponsible!” \nArcadio pushed Úrsula toward the house and surrender ed. A short time later \nthe shooting stopped and the bells began to toll. The  resistance had been wiped \nout in less than half an hour. Not a single one of Arca dio’s men had survived the \nattack, but before dying they had killed three hundred so ldiers. The last \nstronghold was the barracks. Before being attacked, the sup posed Colonel \nGregorio Stevenson had freed the prisoners and ordere d his men to go out and \nfight in the street. The extraordinary mobility and acc urate aim with which he \nplaced his twenty cartridges gave the impression that the barracks was well-\ndefended, and the attackers blew it to pieces with cannon  fire. The captain who \ndirected the operation was startled to find the rubble  deserted and a single dead \nman in his undershorts with an empty rifle still clutche d in an arm that had been \nblown completely off. He had a woman’s full head of ha ir held at the neck with a \ncomb and on his neck a chain with a small gold fish. When he turned him over \nwith the tip of his boot and put the light on his fa ce, the captain was perplexed. \n“Jesus Christ,” he exclaimed. Other officers came over. \n“Look where this fellow turned up,” the captain said. “ It’s Gregorio \nStevenson.” \nAt dawn, after a summary court martial, Arcadio was shot  against the wall of \nthe cemetery. In the last two hours of his life he did n ot manage to understand \nwhy the fear that had tormented him since childhood ha d disappeared. \nImpassive. without even worrying about making a show o f his recent bravery, he \nlistened to the interminable charges of the accusation.

He th ought about his people \nwithout sentimentality, with a strict dosing of his account s with life, beginning to \nunderstand how much he really loved the people he hat ed most. The president of \nthe court-martial began his final speech when Arcadio r ealized that two hours had \npassed. “Even if the proven charges did not have merit  enough,” the president \nwas saying, “the irresponsible and criminal boldness with which the accused \ndrove his subordinates on to a useless death would be en ough to deserve capital \npunishment.” In the shattered schoolhouse where for t he first time he had felt the \nsecurity of power, a few feet from the room where he h ad come to know the \nuncertainty of love, Arcadio found the formality of dea th ridiculous. Death really \ndid not matter to him but life did, and therefore t he sensation he felt when they \ngave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of n ostalgia. He did not speak \nuntil they asked him for his last request. \n“Tell my wife,” he answered in a well-modulated voice,  “to giv e the gi rl  th e \nname of Úrsula.” He paused and said it again: “Úrsul a, like her grandmother. And \ntell her also that if the child that is to be born is a boy, they should name him José \nArcadio, not for his uncle, but for his grandfather.” \nBefore they took him to the execution wall Father Nican or tried to attend him. \n“I have nothing to repent,” Arcadio said, and he put himself under the orders of \nthe squad after drinking a cup of black coffee. The lea der of the squad, a \nspecialist in summary executions, had a name that had muc h more about it than \nchance: Captain Roque Carnicero, which meant butcher. On the way to the \ncemetery, under the persistent drizzle, Arcadio saw that a radiant Wednesday \nwas breaking out on the horizon. His nostalgia disappear ed with the mist and left \nan immense curiosity in its place. Only when they ordered  him to put his back to \nthe wall did Arcadio see Rebeca, with wet hair and a pink flowered dress, \nopening wide the door. He made an effort to get her  to recognize him.

The \ncaptain gave the order to fire.

            "0": "THE WAR was over in May. Two weeks before the governmen t made the \nofficial announcement in a high-sounding proclamation,  which promised \nmerciless punishment for those who had started the rebe llion, Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía fell prisoner just as he was about to reach the western frontier disguised \nas an Indian witch doctor. Of the twenty-one men who h ad followed him to war, \nfourteen fell in combat, six were wounded, and only on e accompanied him at the \nmoment of final defeat: Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. The news of his capture was \nannounced in Macondo with a special proclamation. “He’s alive,” Úrsula told her \nhusband. “Let’s pray to God for his enemies to show him clemency.” After three \ndays of weeping, one afternoon as she was stirring some sw eet milk candy in the \nkitchen she heard her son’s voice clearly in her ear. “It was Aureliano, “ she \nshouted, running toward the chestnut tree to tell her husband the news. “I don’t \nknow how the miracle took place, but he’s alive and we’r e going to see him very \nsoon.” She took it for granted. She had the floors of the house scrubbed and \nchanged the position of the furniture. One week later a rumor from somewhere \nthat was not supported by any proclamation gave dramatic confirmation to the \nprediction. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been condem ned to death and the \nsentence would be carried out in Macondo as a lesson to t he population. On \nMonday, at ten-thirty in the morning, Amaranta was dre ssing Aureliano José \nwhen she heard the sound of a distant troop and the b last of a cornet one second \nbefore Úrsula burst into the room with the shout: “Th ey’re bringing him now!” The \ntroop struggled to subdue the overflowing crowd with their rifle butts. Úrsula and \nAmaranta ran to the corner, pushing their way through , and then they saw him. \nHe looked like a beggar. His clothing was torn, his hair  and beard were tangled, \nand he was barefoot. He was walking without feeling th e burning dust, his hands",
            "1": "tied behind his back with a rope that a mounted officer  had attached to the head \nof his horse. Along with him, also ragged and defeate d, they were bringing \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez. They were not sad. They seem ed more disturbed by \nthe crowd that was shouting all kinds of insults at the troops. \n“My son!” Úrsula shouted in the midst of the uproar, and  she slapped the \nsoldier who tried to hold her back. The officer’s horse r eared. Then Colonel \nAureliano Buendía stopped, tremulous, avoided the arm s of his mother, and fixed \na stern look on her eyes. \n“Go home, Mama,” he said. “Get permission from the aut horities to come \nsee me in jail.” \nHe looked at Amaranta, who stood indecisively two steps b ehind Úrsula, and \nhe smiled as he asked her, “What happened to your hand?”  Amaranta raised the \nhand with the black bandage. “A burn,” she said, and to ok Úrsula away so that \nthe horses would not run her down. The troop took off.  A special guard \nsurrounded the prisoners and took them to the jail at a  trot. \nAt dusk Úrsula visited Colonel Aureliano Buendía in ja il. She had tried to get \npermission through Don Apolinar Moscote, but he had lost  all authority in the face \nof the military omnipotence. Father Nicanor was in bed with hepatic fever. The \nparents of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who had not be en condemned to death, \nhad tried to see him and were driven off with rifle butts. Facing the impossibility of \nfinding anyone to intervene, convinced that her son wou ld be shot at dawn, \nÚrsula wrapped up the things she wanted to bring him and went to the jail alone. \n“I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía,” she announced. \nThe sentries blocked her way. “I’m going in in any case,” Úrsula warned \nthem. “So if you have orders to shoot, start right in. ” She pushed one of them \naside and went into the former classroom, where a group  of half-dressed soldiers \nwere oiling their weapons. An officer in a field unif orm, ruddy-faced, with very \nthick glasses and ceremonious manners, signaled to the sentri es to withdraw.",
            "2": "“I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendía,” Úrsu la repeated. \n“You must mean,” the officer corrected with a friendly sm ile, “that you are the \nmother of Mister  Aureliano Buendía.” Úrsula recognized in his affected way of \nspeaking the languid cadence of the stuck-up people from t he highlands. \n“As you say, mister ,” she accepted, “just as long as I can see him.” \nThere were superior orders that prohibited visits to prisoners condemned to \ndeath, but the officer assumed the responsibility of let ting her have a fifteen-\nminute stay. Úrsula showed him what she had in the bun dle: a change of clean \nclothing, the short boots that her son had worn at his wedding, and the sweet milk \ncandy that she had kept for him since the day she had sense d his return. She \nfound Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the room that wa s used as a cell, lying on a \ncot with his arms spread out because his armpits were paved  with sores. They \nhad allowed him to shave. The thick mustache with twiste d ends accentuated the \nsharp angles of his cheekbones. He looked paler to Úrsula than when he had left, \na little taller, and more solitary than ever. He knew all about the details of the \nhouse: Pietro Crespi’s suicide, Arcadio’s arbitrary acts an d execution. the \ndauntlessness of José Arcadio Buendía underneath the chestn ut tree. He knew \nthat Amaranta had consecrated her virginal widowhood t o the rearing of Aureli-\nano José and that the latter was beginning to show sig ns of quite good judgment \nand that he had learned to read and write at the sa me time he had learned to \nspeak. From the moment In which she entered the room Úrsula felt inhibited by \nthe maturity of her son, by his aura of command, by the g low of authority that \nradiated from his skin. She was surprised that he was so w ell-informed. “You \nknew all along that I was a wizard,” he joked. And he added in a serious tone, \n“This morning, when they brought me here, I had the i mpression that I had \nalready been through all that before.” In fact, while  the crowd was roaring \nalongside him, he had been concentrating his thoughts, st artled at how the town",
            "3": "had aged. The leaves of the almond trees were broken. The houses, painted \nblue, then painted red, had ended up with an indefi nable coloration. \n“What did you expect?” Úrsula sighed. “Time passes.” \n“That’s how it goes,” Aureliano admitted, “but not so much.” \nIn that way the long-awaited visit, for which both had  prepared questions and \nhad even anticipated answers, was once more the usual ever yday conversation. \nWhen the guard announced the end of the visit, Aureli ano took out a roll of \nsweaty papers from under the cot. They were his poetry, th e poems inspired by \nRemedios, which he had taken with him when he left, a nd those he had written \nlater on during chance pauses in the war. “Promise me  th a t  n o  on e  w i l l  r e a d \nthem,” he said. “Light the oven with them this very ni ght.” Úrsula promised and \nstood up to kiss him good-bye. \n“I brought you a revolver,” she murmured. \nColonel Aureliano Buendía saw that the sentry could not  see. “It won’t do me \nany good,” he said in a low voice, “but give it to me in case they search you on \nthe way out.” Úrsula took the revolver out of her bodi ce and put it under the \nmattress of the cot. “And don’t say good-bye,” he concluded  w i t h  e m p h a t i c  \ncalmness. “Don’t beg or bow down to anyone. Pretend tha t they shot me a long \ntime ago.” Úrsula bit her lip so as not to cry. \n“Put some hot stones on those sores,” she said. \nShe turned halfway around and left the room. Colonel  A u r e l i an o  B u en d í a  \nremained standing, thoughtful, until the door closed. Then he lay down again with \nhis arms open. Since the beginning of adolescence, when  h e  h a d b e gu n  t o  b e \naware of his premonitions, he thought that death woul d be announced with a \ndefinite, unequivocal, irrevocable signal, but there we re only a few hours left \nbefore he would die and the signal had not come. On a certain occasion a very \nbeautiful woman had come into his camp in Tucurinca and  asked the sentries’ \npermission to see him. They let her through because they were aware of the",
            "4": "fanaticism of mothers, who sent their daughters to the bedrooms of the most \nfamous warriors, according to what they said, to improve  th e breed. Th at ni gh t \nColonel Aureliano Buendía was finishing the poem abo ut the man who is lost in \nthe rain when the girl came into his room. He turned his back to her to put the \nsheet of paper into the locked drawer where he kept his  poetry. And then he \nsensed it. He grasped the pistol in the drawer without turning his head. \n“Please don’t shoot,” he said. \nWhen he turned around holding his Pistol, the girl ha d lowered hers and did \nnot know what to do. In that way he had avoided four out of eleven traps. On the \nother hand, someone who was never caught entered the re volutionary \nheadquarters one night in Manaure and stabbed to deat h his close friend Colonel \nMagnífico Visbal, to whom he had given his cot so that h e could sweat out a \nfever. A few yards away, sleeping in a hammock in the same  room. he was not \naware of anything. His efforts to systematize his premoni tions were useless. They \nwould come suddenly in a wave of supernatural lucidit y, like an absolute and \nmomentaneous conviction, but they could not be grasped. O n occasion they were \nso natural that he identified them as premonitions onl y after they had been \nfulfilled. Frequently they were nothing but ordinary b its of superstition. But when \nthey condemned him to death and asked him to state his l ast wish, he did not \nhave the least difficulty in identifying the premonitio n that inspired his answer. \n“I ask that the sentence be carried out in Macondo,” he said. \nThe president of the court-martial was annoyed. “Don’t be clever, Buendía,”  \nhe told him. “That’s just a trick to gain more time.” \n“If you don’t fulfill it, that will be your worry.” th e colonel said, “but that’s my \nlast wish.” \nSince then the premonitions had abandoned him. The da y when Úrsula \nvisited him in jail, after a great deal of thinking  he came to the conclusion that \nperhaps death would not be announced that time because it did not depend on",
            "5": "chance but on the will of his executioners. He spent the  night awake, tormented \nby the pain of his sores. A little before dawn he heard  steps in the hallway. \n“They’re coming,” he said to himself, and for no reason  he thought of José \nArcadio Buendía, who at that moment was thinking about  him under the dreary \ndawn of the chestnut tree. He did not feel fear or n ostalgia, but an intestinal rage \nat the idea that this artificial death would not let him see the end of so many \nthings that he had left unfinished. The door opened and a sentry came in with a \nmug of coffee. On the following day at the same hour h e would still be doing what \nhe was then, raging with the pain in his armpits, and the same thing happened. \nOn Thursday he shared the sweet milk candy with the guard s and put on his \nclean clothes, which were tight for him, and the paten t leather boots. By Friday \nthey had still not shot him. \nActually, they did not dare carry out the sentence. The re belliousness of the \ntown made the military men think that the execution o f Colonel Aureliano Buendía \nmight have serious political consequences not only in Maco ndo but throughout \nthe area of the swamp, so they consulted the authoritie s in the capital of the \nprovince. On Saturday night, while they were waiting for an answer Captain \nRoque Carnicero went with some other officers to Catar ino’s place. Only one \nwoman, practically threatened, dared take him to her ro om. “They don’t want to \ngo to bed with a man they know is going to die,” she co nfessed to him. “No one \nknows how it will come, but everybody is going around sayin g that the officer who \nshoots Colonel Aureliano Buendía and all the soldiers i n the squad, one by one, \nwill be murdered, with no escape, sooner or later, eve n if they hide at the ends of \nthe earth.” Captain Roque Carnicero mentioned it to the other officers and they \ntold their superiors. On Sunday, although no one had revealed it openly, although \nno action on the part of the military had disturbed th e tense calm of those days, \nthe whole town knew that the officers were ready to use  any manner of pretext to \navoid responsibility for the execution. The official o rder arrived in the Monday",
            "6": "mail: the execution was to be carried out within twen ty-four hours. That night the \nofficers put seven slips of paper into a cap, and Captain  Roque Carnicero’s \nunpeaceful fate was foreseen by his name on the prize sl ip. “Bad luck doesn’t \nhave any chinks in it,” he said with deep bitterness. “I was born a son of a bitch \nand I’m going to die a son of a bitch.” At five in t he morning he chose the squad \nby lot, formed it in the courtyard, and woke up the cond emned man with a \npremonitory phrase. \n“Let’s go, Buendía,” he told him. “Our time has come.”  \n“So that’s what it was,” the colonel replied. “I was dr eaming that my sores \nhad burst.” \nRebeca Buendía got up at three in the morning when s he learned that \nAureliano would be shot. She stayed in the bedroom in  the dark, watching the \ncemetery wall through the half-opened window as the be d on which she sat \nshook with José Arcadio’s snoring. She had waited all wee k with the same hidden \npersistence with which during different times she had w aited for Pietro Crespi’s \nletters. “They won’t shoot him here,” José Arcadio, told her. “They’ll shoot him at \nmidnight in the barracks so that no one will know who ma de up the squad, and \nthey’ll bury him right there.” Rebeca kept on waiting.  “They’re stupid enough to \nshoot him here,” she said. She was so certain that she ha d foreseen the way she \nwould open the door to wave good-bye. “They won’t bri ng him through the \nstreets,” José Arcadio insisted, with six scared soldiers and knowing that the \npeople are ready for anything.” Indifferent to her hu sband’s logic, Rebeca stayed \nby the window. \n“You’ll see that they’re just stupid enough,” she said. \nOn Tuesday, at five-in the. morning, José Arcadio had dr unk his coffee and \nlet the dogs out when Rebeca closed the window and held  onto the head of the \nbed so as not to fall down. “There, they’re bringing h im,” she sighed. “He’s so \nhandsome.” José Arcadio looked out the window and saw hi m. tremulous in the",
            "7": "light of dawn. He already had his back to the wall and  his hands were on his hips \nbecause the burning knots in his armpits would not let him lower them. “A person \nfucks himself up so much,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said . “Fucks himself up so \nmuch just so that six weak fairies can kill him and he can’ t do anything about it.” \nHe repeated it with so much rage that it almost seemed  to be fervor, and Captain \nRoque Carnicero was touched, because he thought he was p raying. When the \nsquad took aim, the rage had materialized into a viscous a nd bitter substance \nthat put his tongue to sleep and made him close his eyes.  Th en th e alum inum \nglow of dawn disappeared and he saw himself again in s hort pants, wearing a tie \naround his neck, and he saw his father leading him into the tent on a splendid \nafternoon, and he saw the ice. When he heard the shou t he thought that it was \nthe final command to the squad. He opened his eyes with a shudder of curiosity, \nexpecting to meet the incandescent trajectory of the bull ets, but he only saw \nCaptain Roque Carnicero with his arms in the air and Jo sé Arcadio crossing the \nstreet with his fearsome shotgun ready to go off. \n“Don’t shoot,” the captain said to José Arcadio. “You wer e sent by Divine \nProvidence.” \nAnother war began right there. Captain Roque Carnice ro and his six men left \nwith Colonel Aureliano Buendía to free the revoluti onary general Victorio Medina, \nwho had been condemned to death in Riohacha. They tho ught they could save \ntime by crossing the mountains along the trail that José Arcadio Buendía had \nfollowed to found Macondo, but before a week was out t hey were convinced that \nit was an impossible undertaking. So they had to follow the dangerous route over \nthe outcroppings; with no other munitions but what the  firing squad had. They \nwould camp near the towns and one of them, with a sma ll gold fish in his hand, \nwould go in disguise in broad daylight to contact the d ormant Liberals, who would \ngo out hunting on the following morning and never r eturn. When they saw \nRiohacha from a ridge in the mountains, General Victo rio Medina had been shot.",
            "8": "Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s men proclaimed him chief  of the revolutionary forces \nof the Caribbean coast with the rank of general. He ass umed the position but \nrefused the promotion and took the stand that he would  never accept it as long as \nthe Conservative regime was in power. At the end of t hree months they had \nsucceeded in arming more than a thousand men, but they were wiped out. The \nsurvivors reached the eastern frontier. The next thing  that was heard of them was \nthat they had landed on Cabo de la Vela, coming from the smaller islands of the \nAntilles, and a message from the government was sent al l over by telegraph and \nincluded in jubilant proclamations throughout the count ry announcing the death of \nColonel Aureliano Buendía. But two days later a multi ple telegram which almost \novertook the previous one announced another uprising o n the southern plains. \nThat was how the legend of the ubiquitous Colonel Aur eliano Buendía, began. \nSimultaneous and contradictory information declared him  victorious in Villanueva. \ndefeated in Guacamayal, devoured by Motilón Indians, de ad in a village in the \nswamp, and up in arms again in Urumita. The Liberal l eaders, who at that \nmoment were negotiating for participation in the cong ress, branded him in \nadventurer who did not represent the party. The natio nal government placed him \nin the category of a bandit and put a price of five th ousand pesos on his head. \nAfter sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendía left  Guajira with two thousand \nwell-armed Indians and the garrison, which was taken by surprise as it slept, \nabandoned Riohacha. He established his headquarters th ere and proclaimed \ntotal war against the regime. The first message he rece ived from the government \nwas a threat to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Márquez withi n forty-eight hours if he did \nnot withdraw with his forces to the eastern frontier. C olonel Roque Carnicero, \nwho was his chief of staff then, gave him the telegram with a look of \nconsternation, but he read it with unforeseen joy. \n“How wonderful!” he exclaimed. “We have a telegraph  office in Macondo \nnow.”",
            "9": "His reply was definitive. In three months he expected to  establish his \nheadquarters in Macondo. If he did not find Colonel G erineldo Márquez alive at \nthat time he would shoot out of hand all of the off icers he held prisoner at that \nmoment starting with the generals, and he would give orders to his subordinates \nto do the same for the rest of the war. Three months later, when he entered \nMacondo in triumph, the first embrace he received on th e swamp road was that of \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez. \nThe house was full of children. Úrsula had taken in San ta Sofía de la Piedad \nwith her older daughter and a pair of twins, who had  been born five months after \nArcadio had been shot. Contrary to the victim’s last wishe s, she baptized the girl \nwith the name of Remedios. I’m sure that was what Arca dio meant,” she alleged. \n“We won’t call her Úrsula, because a person suffers too much with that name.” \nThe twins were named José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano  Segundo. Amaranta \ntook care of them all. She put small wooden chairs in the living room and \nestablished a nursery with other children from neighbo ring families. When \nColonel Aureliano Buendía returned in the midst of e xploding rockets and ringing \nbells, a children’s chorus welcomed him to the house. Au reliano José, tall like his \ngrandfather, dressed as a revolutionary officer, gave hi m military honors. \nNot all the news was good. A year after the flight of Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía, José Arcadio and Rebeca went to live in the hou se Arcadio had built. \nNo one knew about his intervention to halt the execu tion. In the new house, \nlocated on the best corner of the square, in the shade of an almond tree that was \nhonored by three nests of redbreasts, with a large door for visitors and four \nwindows for light, they set up a hospitable home. Rebec a’s old friends, among \nthem four of the Moscote sisters who were still single, on ce more took up the \nsessions of embroidery that had been interrupted years bef ore on the porch with \nthe begonias. José Arcadio continued to profit from the usurped lands, the title to \nwhich was recognized by the Conservative government. Eve ry afternoon he could",

O n e  S e p t e m b e r  \nafternoon, with the threat of a storm, he returned h ome earlier than usual. He \ngreeted Rebeca in the dining room, tied the dogs up i n the courtyard, hung the \nrabbits up in the kitchen to be salted later, and went to the bedroom to change his \nclothes. Rebeca later declared that when her husband we nt into the bedroom she \nwas locked in the bathroom and did not hear anything. I t was a difficult version to \nbelieve, but there was no other more plausible, and n o one could think of any \nmotive for Rebeca to murder the man who had made her  happy. That was \nperhaps the only mystery that was never cleared up in Macon do. As soon as \nJosé Arcadio closed the bedroom door the sound of a pisto l shot echoed through \nthe house. A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, \nwent out into the street, continued on in a straight l ine across the uneven \nterraces, went down steps and climbed over curbs, passed alo ng the Street of the \nTurks, turned a corner to the right and another to the  l eft, m ade a righ t an gl e at \nthe Buendía house, went in under the closed door, crossed  th rou gh the parl or, \nhugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on t o the other living room, \nmade a wide curve to avoid the dining-room table, we nt along the porch with the \nbegonias, and passed without being seen under Amaranta’ s chair as she gave an \narithmetic lesson to Aureliano José , and went through  the pantry and came out \nin the kitchen, where Úrsula was getting ready to crack th irty-six eggs to make \nbread. \n“Holy Mother of God!” Úrsula shouted. \nShe followed the thread of blood back along its course, and in search of its \norigin she went through the pantry, along the begoni a porch where Aureliano \nJosé was chanting that three plus three is six and six plus three is nine, and she \ncrossed the dining room and the living rooms and follow ed straight down the \nstreet, and she turned first to the right and then to  the left to th e S treet of th e",

They found no wound on his body nor could they locate the \nweapon. Nor was it possible to remove the smell of pow der from the corpse. First \nthey washed him three times with soap and a scrubbing br ush, and they rubbed \nhim with salt and vinegar, then with ashes and lemon, and finally they put him in a \nbarrel of lye and let him stay for six hours. They scrubbed  him so much that the \narabesques of his tattooing began to fade. When they th ought of the desperate \nmeasure of seasoning him with pepper, cumin seeds, and l aurel leaves and \nboiling him for a whole day over a slow fire, he ha d already begun to decompose \nand they had to bury him hastily. They sealed him hermeti cally in a special coffin \nseven and a half feet long and four feet wide, reinf orced inside with iron plates \nand fastened together with steel bolts, and even then t he smell could be \nperceived on the streets through which the funeral proce ssion passed.

The last time anyone saw her alive was when wi th one shot she killed \na thief who was trying to force the door of her house.

At \none time it was discovered that she was writing letters to the Bishop, whom she \nclaimed as a first cousin. but it was never said whether s he received any reply. \nThe town forgot about her. \nIn spite of his triumphal return, Colonel Aureliano B uendía was not \nenthusiastic over the looks of things. The government tr oops abandoned their \npositions without resistance and that aroused an illusion  of victory among the \nLiberal population that it was not right to destroy, b ut the revolutionaries knew the \ntruth, Colonel Aureliano Buendía better than any of them. Although at that \nmoment he had more than five thousand men under his co mmand and held two \ncoastal states, he had the feeling of being hemmed in a gainst the sea and caught \nin a situation that was so confused that when he ordered  the restoration of the \nchurch steeple, which had been knocked down by army cannon  fire, Father Nica-\nnor commented from his sickbed: “This is silly; the defende rs of the faith of Christ \ndestroy the church and the Masons order it rebuilt.” Lo oking for a loophole \nthrough which he could escape, he spent hours on end in the telegraph office \nconferring with the commanders of other towns, and ever y time he would emerge \nwith the firmest impression that the war was at a stalem ate.

After cleaning out his stomach with emetics, she wrapped \nhim in hot blankets and fed him egg whites for two days until his harrowed body \nrecovered its normal temperature. On the fourth day he  was out of danger. \nAgainst his will, pressured by Úrsula and his officers, he stayed in bed for another \nweek. Only then did he learn that his verses had not bee n burned. “I didn’t want \nto be hasty,” Úrsula explained to him. “That night whe n I went to light the oven I \nsaid to myself that it would be better to wait until t hey brought the body.” In the \nhaze of convalescence, surrounded by Remedios’ dusty dolls, Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía, brought back the decisive periods of his existence  by reading his \npoetry.

Then his thoughts became so clear th at he was able to \nexamine them forward and backward. One night he asked Colonel Gerineldo \nMárquez: \n“Tell me something, old friend: why are you fighting?”  \n“What other reason could there be?” Colonel Gerineldo  Márquez answered. \n“For the great liberal party.” \n“You’re lucky because you know why,” he answered. “As far as I’m \nconcerned, I’ve come to realize only just now that I’m f ighting because of pride.” \n“That’s bad,” Colonel Gerineldo Márquez said. Colone l Aureliano Buendía \nwas amused at his alarm. “Naturally,” he said. “But in a ny case, it’s better than \nnot knowing why you’re fighting.” He looked him in the  eyes and added with a \nsmile: \n“Or fighting, like you, for something that doesn’t hav e any meaning for \nanyone.” \nHis pride had prevented him from making contact with th e armed groups in \nthe interior of the country until the leaders of the p arty publicly rectified their \ndeclaration that he was a bandit. He knew, however, t hat as soon as he put those \nscruples aside he would break the vicious circle of the wa r. Convalescence gave \nhim time to reflect.

Although he lived in his parents’ house he would have lunch at Úrsula’s \ntwo or three times a week. He initiated Aureliano José in the use of firearms, \ngave him early military instruction, and for several mon ths took him to live in the \nbarracks, with Úrsula’s consent, so that he could become a m an. Many years \nbefore, when he was still almost a child, Gerineldo Már quez had declared his love \nfor Amaranta. At that time she was so illusioned with  her lonely passion for Pietro \nCrespi that she laughed at him. Gerineldo Márquez wa ited. On a certain occasion \nhe sent Amaranta a note from jail asking her to embroi der a dozen batiste \nhandkerchiefs with his father’s initials on them. He sent  her the money. A week \nlater Amaranta, brought the dozen handkerchiefs to him  i n  j a i l  a l o n g  w i t h  t h e  \nmoney and they spent several hours talking about the pa st. “When I get out of \nhere I’m going to marry you,” Gerineldo Márquez told her when she left. \nAmaranta laughed but she kept on thinking about him w hile she taught the chil-\ndren to read and she tried to revive her juvenile pa ssion for Pietro Crespi. On \nSaturday, visiting days for the prisoners, she would stop b y the house of \nGerineldo Marquez's parents and accompany them to the j ail. On one of those \nSaturdays Úrsula was surprised to see her in the kitchen, waiting for the biscuits \nto come out of the oven so that she could pick the best o nes and cap them in a \nnapkin that she had embroidered for the occasion. \n“Marry him,” she told her. “You’ll have a hard time finding another man like \nhim.” \nAmaranta feigned a reaction of displeasure. \n“I don’t have to go around hunting for men,” she an swered. “I’m taking these \nbiscuits to Gerineldo because I’m sorry that sooner or la ter they’re going to shoot \nhim.” \nShe said it without thinking, but that was the time t hat the government had \nannounced its threat to shoot Colonel Gerineldo Márque z if the rebel forces did",

Amaranta shut herself up to weep, \noverwhelmed by a feeling of guilt similar to the one  that had tormented her when \nRemedios died, as if once more her careless words had been  responsible for a \ndeath. Her mother consoled her. She inured her that C olonel Aureliano Buendía \nwould do something to prevent the execution and prom ised that she would take \ncharge of attracting Gerineldo Márquez herself when th e war was over. She \nfulfilled her promise before the imagined time. When  Gerineldo Márquez returned \nto the house, invested with his new dignity of civil an d military leader, she \nreceived him as a son, thought of delightful bits of fl attery to hold him there, and \nprayed with all her soul that he would remember his p lan to marry Amaranta. Her \npleas seemed to be answered. On the days that he would have lunch at the \nhouse, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez would linger on the  begonia porch playing \nChinese checkers with Amaranta. Úrsula would bring them  coffee and milk and \nbiscuits and would take over the children so that they w ould not bother them. \nAmaranta was really making an effort to kindle in her heart the forgotten ashes of \nher youthful passion. With an anxiety that came to be in tolerable, she waited for \nthe lunch days, the afternoons of Chinese checkers, and t ime flew by in the \ncompany of the warrior with a nostalgic name whose finge rs trembled \nimperceptibly as he moved the pieces. But the day on whi ch Colonel Gerineldo \nMárquez repeated his wish to marry her, she rejected hi m. \n“I’m not going to marry anyone,” she told him, “much less you. You love \nAureliano so much that you want to marry me because you ca n’t marry him.” \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez was a patient man. “I’ll ke ep on insisting,” he \nsaid. “Sooner or later I’ll convince you.” He kept on v isiting the house. Shut up in \nher bedroom biting back her secret tears, Amaranta put h er fingers in her ears so \nas not to bear the voice of the suitor as he gave Úrsula  the latest war news, and \nin spite of the fact that she was dying to see him she h ad the strength not to go \nout and meet him.",
            "17": "At that time Colonel Aureliano Buendía took the time  to send a detailed \naccount to Macondo every two weeks. But only once, almost ei ght months after \nhe had left, did he write to Úrsula. A special messenger  brought a sealed \nenvelope to the house with a sheet of paper inside be aring the colonel’s delicate \nhand: Take good care of Papa because he is going to die . Úrsula became \nalarmed. “If Aureliano says so it’s because Aureliano kno ws,” she said. And she \nhad them help her take José Arcadio Buendía to his bedr oom. Not only was he \nas heavy as ever, but during his prolonged stay under t he chestnut tree he had \ndeveloped the faculty of being able to increase his weig ht at will, to such a degree \nthat seven men were unable to lift him and they had to  drag h im  to th e bed. A  \nsmell of tender mushrooms, of wood-flower fungus, of o ld and concentrated \noutdoors impregnated the air of the bedroom as it wa s breathed by the colossal \nold man weather-beaten by the sun and the rain. The next morning he was not in \nhis bed. In spite of his undiminished strength, José Arcad io Buendía was in no \ncondition to resist. It was all the same to him. If he w ent back to the chestnut tree \nit was not because he wanted to but because of a habit of his body. Úrsula took \ncare of him, fed him, brought him news of Aureliano. But actually, the only person \nwith whom he was able to have contact for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar. \nAlmost pulverized at that time by the decrepitude of de ath, Prudencio Aguilar \nwould come twice a day to chat with him. They talked abou t fighting cocks. They \npromised each other to set up a breeding farm for mag nificent birds, not so much \nto enjoy their victories, which they would not need then , as to have something to \ndo on the tedious Sundays of death. It was Prudencio Ag uilar who cleaned him \nfed him and brought him splendid news of an unknown p erson called Aureliano \nwho was a colonel in the war. When he was alone, José A rcadio Buendía \nconsoled himself with the dream of the infinite rooms. He dreamed that he was \ngetting out of bed, opening the door and going into  an identical room with the \nsame bed with a wrought-iron head, the same wicker chai r, and the same small",

From t hat room he would go into \nanother that was just the same, the door of which woul d open into another that \nwas just the same, the door of which would open into a nother one just the same, \nand then into another exactly alike, and so on to infi nity. He liked to go from room \nto room. As in a gallery of parallel mirrors, until Pr udencio Aguilar would touch \nhim on the shoulder. Then he would go back from room to room, walking in \nreverse, going back over his trail, and he would find  P ru d en ci o  A gu i l a r  i n  t h e \nroom of reality. But one night, two weeks after they to ok him to his bed, \nPrudencio Aguilar touched his shoulder in an interme diate room and he stayed \nthere forever, thinking that it was the real room. O n the following morning Úrsula \nwas bringing him his breakfast when she saw a man coming along the hall. He \nwas short and stocky, with a black suit on and a hat that was also black, \nenormous, pulled down to his taciturn eyes. “Good Lord,”  Úrsula thought, “I could \nhave sworn it was Melquíades.” It was Cataure, Visitació n’s brother, who had left \nthe house fleeing from the insomnia plague and of who m there had never been \nany news. Visitación asked him why he had come back, and he a nswered her in \ntheir solemn language: \n“I have come for the exequies of the king.” \nThen they went into José Arcadio Buendía’s room, shook him  as hard as \nthey could, shouted in his ear, put a mirror in front of his nostrils, but they could \nnot awaken him. A short time later, when the carpenter  was taking measurements \nfor the coffin, through the window they saw a light ra in of tiny yellow flowers \nfalling. They fell on the town all through the night  in a silent storm, and they \ncovered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered th e animals who dept \noutdoors. So many flowers fell from the sky that in the m orning the streets were \ncarpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels \nand rakes so that the funeral procession could pass by."

His blackheads bled and he cut his upper \nlip as he tried to shape a mustache of blond fuzz and  when it was all over he \nlooked the same as before, but the laborious process gave Amaranta the feeling \nthat she had begun to grow old at that moment. \n“You look just like Aureliano when he was your age,” she said. “You’re a \nman now.” \nHe had been for a long time, ever since that distant d ay when Amaranta \nthought he was still a child and continued getting und ressed in front of him in the \nbathroom as she had always done, as she had been used to  doing ever since \nPilar Ternera had turned him over to her to finish his upbringing. The first time \nthat he saw her the only thing that drew his attention  was the deep depression \nbetween her breasts. He was so innocent that he asked her what had happened \nto her and Amaranta pretended to dig into her breast s with the tips of her fingers \nand answered: “They gave me some terrible cuts.” Some time later, when she \nhad recovered from Pietro Crespi’s suicide and would b athe with Aureliano José \nagain, he no longer paid attention to the depression but felt a strange trembling at \nthe sight of the splendid breasts with their brown nip ples.

E arly one morning during the \ntime when she refused Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, Aur eliano José awoke with \nthe feeling that he could not breathe. He felt Amara nta’s fingers searching across \nhis stomach like warm and anxious little caterpillars. Pr etending to sleep, he \nchanged his position to make it easier, and then he fel t the hand without the black \nbandage diving like a blind shellfish into the algae of his anxiety. Although they \nseemed to ignore what both of them knew and what each  one knew that the other \nknew, from that night on they were yoked together in an  inviolable complicity. \nAureliano José could not get to sleep until he heard th e twelve-o’clock waltz on \nthe parlor dock, and the mature maiden whose skin was beg inning to grow sad \ndid not have a moments’ rest until she felt slip in un der her mosquito netting that \nsleepwalker whom she had raised, not thinking that he wo uld be a palliative for \nher solitude. Later they not only slept together, nake d, exchanging exhausting \ncaresses, but they would also chase each other into the cor ners of the house and \nshut themselves up in the bedrooms at any hour of the day in a permanent state \nof unrelieved excitement. They were almost discovered b y Úrsula one afternoon \nwhen she went into the granary as they were starting to  kiss. “Do you love your \naunt a lot?” she asked Aureliano José in an innocent way. He answered that he \ndid. “That’s good of you,” Úrsula concluded and finish ed measuring the flour for \nthe bread and returned to the kitchen. That episode drew Amaranta out of her \ndelirium.

While the \ngovernment itself admitted the progress of the rebelli on, the officers in Macondo \nhad confidential reports of the imminence of a negotia ted peace. Toward the first \nof April a special emissary identified himself to Colonel  Gerin el do Márqu ez . H e \nconfirmed the fact to him that the leaders of the part y had indeed established \ncontact with the rebel leaders in the interior and wer e on the verge of arranging \nan armistice in exchange for three cabinet posts for the  Liberals, a minority \nrepresentation in the congress, and a general amnesty for  rebels who laid down \ntheir arms. The emissary brought a highly confidential o rder from Colonel \nAureliano Buendía, who was not in agreement with the  terms of the armistice. \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez was to choose five of his be st men and prepare to \nleave the country with them. The order would be carrie d out with the strictest \nsecrecy. One week before the agreement was announced, and in the midst of a \nstorm of contradictory rumors, Colonel Aureliano Buendía  and ten trusted \nofficers, among them Colonel Roque Carnicero, stealthil y arrived in Macondo \nafter midnight, dismissed the garrison, buried their we apons, and destroyed their \nrecords. By dawn they had left town, along with Colonel  Gerineldo Márquez and \nhis five officers. It was such a quick and secret operation t hat Úrsula did not find \nout about it until the last moment, when someone tapp ed on her bedroom window \nand whispered, “If you want to see Colonel Aureliano B uendía, come to the door \nright now.” Úrsula Jumped out of bed and went to the  door in her nightgown and \nshe was just able to see the horsemen who were leaving t own gallop off in a \nmute cloud of dust. Only on the following day did she d iscover that Aureliano \nJosé had gone with his father. \nTen days after a joint communiqué by the government and  t h e  o p p o si t i on  \nannounced the end of the war, there was news of the fi rst armed uprising of",
            "3": "Colonel Aureliano Buendía on the western border. His  small and poorly armed \nforce was scattered in less than a week. But during that ye ar, while Liberals and \nConservatives tried to make the country believe in reconcil iation, he attempted \nseven other revolts. One night he bombarded Riohacha f rom a schooner and the \ngarrison dragged out of bed and shot the fourteen be st-known Liberals in the \ntown as a reprisal. For more than two weeks he held a c ustoms post on the \nborder and from there sent the nation a call to gener al war. Another of his \nexpectations was lost for three months in the jungle in  a mad attempt to cross \nmore than a thousand miles of virgin territory in orde r to proclaim war on the \noutskirts of the capital. On one occasion he was lea tha n fifteen miles away from \nMacondo and was obliged by government patrols to hide i n the mountains, very \nclose to the enchanted region where his father had fou nd the fossil of a Spanish \ngalleon many years before. \nVisitación died around that time. She had the pleasure  of dying a natural \ndeath after having renounced a throne out of fear of insomnia, and her last wish \nwas that they should dig up the wages she had saved for  more than twenty years \nunder her bed and send the money to Colonel Aureliano  Buendía so that he \ncould go on with the war. But Úrsula did not bother to dig it up because it was \nrumored in those days that Colonel Aureliano Buendía h ad been killed in a \nlanding near the provincial capital. The official annou ncement—the fourth in less \nthan two years—was considered true for almost six months be cause nothing \nfurther was heard of him. Suddenly, when Úrsula and A maranta had added new \nmourning to the past period, unexpected news arrived. Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía was alive, but apparently he had stopped harassi ng the government of \nhis country and had joined with the victorious federalis m of other republics of the \nCaribbean. He would show up under different names f arther and farther away \nfrom his own country. Later it would be learned that t he idea that was working on \nhim at the time was the unification of the federalist forms of Central America in",

The first direct \nnews that Úrsula received from him, several years after his departure, was a \nwrinkled and faded letter that had arrived, passing th rough various hands, from \nSantiago, Cuba. \n“We’ve lost him forever,” Úrsula exclaimed on reading it. “If he follows this \npath he’ll spend Christmas at the ends of the earth.” \nThe person to whom she said it, who was the first to who m she showed the \nletter, was the Conservative general José Raquel Moncada,  mayor of Macondo \nsince the end of the war. “This Aureliano,” General Mo ncada commented, “what a \npity that he’s not a Conservative.” He really admired him. Like many Conservative \ncivilians, José Raquel Moncada had waged war in defense of  his party and had \nearned the title of general on the field of battle,  even though he was not a military \nman by profession. On the contrary, like so many of his fel low party members, he \nwas an antimilitarist. He considered military men unprin cipled loafers, ambitious \nplotters, experts in facing down civilians in order to pr osper during times of \ndisorder. Intelligent, pleasant, ruddy-faced, a man who  liked to eat and watch \ncockfights, he had been at one time the most feared adve rsary of Colonel \nAureliano Buendía. He succeeded in imposing his author ity over the career \nofficers in a wide sector along the coast. One time when he was forced by \nstrategic circumstances to abandon a stronghold to the force s of Colonel \nAureliano Buendía, he left two letters for him. In o ne of them quite long, he invited \nhim to join in a campaign to make war more humane. Th e other letter was for his \nwife, who lived in Liberal territory, and he left it  with a plea to see that it reached \nits destination. From then on, even in the bloodiest p eriods of the war, the two \ncommanders would arrange truces to exchange prisoners. Th ey were pauses \nwith a certain festive atmosphere, which General Moncad a took advantage of to \nteach Colonel Aureliano Buendía how to play chess.

He wor e civilian clothes, \nreplaced the soldiers with unarmed policemen, enforced t he amnesty laws, and \nhelped a few families of Liberals who had been killed in the war. He succeeded in \nhaving Macondo raised to the status of a municipality an d he was therefore its \nfirst mayor, and he created an atmosphere of confidence t hat made people think \nof the war as an absurd nightmare of the past.

Bruno Crespi, who  was married to Amparo Mos. \ncote, and whose shop of toys and musical instruments continu ed to prosper, built \na theater which Spanish companies included in their  Itineraries. It was a vast \nopen-air hall with wooden benches, a velvet curtain with Greek masks, and three \nbox offices in the shape of lions’ heads, through whose  mouths the tickets were \nsold. It was also about that time that the school was re built. It was put under the \ncharge of Don Melchor Escalona, an old teacher brought  from the swamp, who \nmade his lazy students walk on their knees in the lime-coat ed courtyard and \nmade the students who talked in class eat hot chili with t he approval of their \nparents.

At the table they did n ot dare look each \nother in the face. But two weeks after his return, in t he presence of Úrsula, he set \nhis eyes on hers and said to her, “I always thought a lot about you.” Amaranta \navoided him. She guarded against chance meetings. She  tried not to become \nseparated from Remedios the Beauty. She was ashamed of the blush that \ncovered her cheeks on the day her nephew asked her how lo ng she intended \nwearing the black bandage on her hand, for she interpr eted it as an allusion to \nher virginity. When he arrived, she barred the door o f her bedroom, but she heard \nhis peaceful snoring in the next room for so many night s that she forgot about the \nprecaution. Early one morning, almost two months after his return, she heard him \ncome into the bedroom. Then, instead of fleeing, inste ad of shouting as she had \nthought she would, she let herself be saturated with a  soft feeling of relaxation. \nShe felt him slip in under the mosquito netting as he had done when he was a \nchild, as he had always done, and she could not repress he r cold sweat and the \nchattering of her teeth when she realized that he wa s completely naked. “Go \naway,” she whispered, suffocating with curiosity. “Go away or I’ll scream.” But \nAureliano José knew then what he had to do, because he was no longer a child \nbut a barracks animal. Starting with that night the du ll, inconsequential battles \nbegan again and would go on until dawn. “I’m your au nt,” Amaranta murmured, \nspent. “It’s almost as if I were your mother, not just be cause of my age but \nbecause the only thing I didn’t do for you was nurse you. ” Aureliano would",

He had nit stopped \ndesiring her for a single instant. He found her in the  dark bedrooms of captured \ntowns, especially in the most abject ones, and he would ma ke her materialize in \nthe smell of dry blood on the bandages of the wounded , in the instantaneous \nterror of the danger of death, at all times and in a ll places. He had fled from her in \nan attempt to wipe out her memory, not only through d istance but by means of a \nmuddled fury that his companions at arms took to be boldn ess, but the more her \nimage wallowed in the dunghill of the war, the more  the war resembled Amaranta. \nThat was how he suffered in exile, looking for a way of killing her with, his own \ndeath, until he heard some old man tell the tale of the man who had married his \naunt, who was also his cousin, and whose son ended up bei ng his own \ngrandfather. \n“Can a person marry his own aunt?” he asked, startled. \n“He not only can do that, a soldier answered him. “but we’re fighting this war \nagainst the priests so that a person can marry his own moth er.” \nTwo weeks later he deserted. He found Amaranta more wi thered than in his \nmemory, more melancholy and shy, and now really turning  the last corner of \nmaturity, but more feverish than ever in the darkness o f her bedroom and more \nchallenging than ever in the aggressiveness of her resista nce. “You’re a brute,” \nAmaranta would tell him as she was harried by his hounds.  “You can’t do that to a \npoor aunt unless you have a special dispensation from the  P o p e . ”  A u r e l i a n o ,  \nJosé promised to go to Rome, he promised to go across Euro pe on his knees to \nkiss the sandals of the Pontiff just so that she would lowe r her drawbridge. \n“It’s not just that,” Amaranta retorted. “Any children  will be born with the tail \nof a pig.” \nAureliano José was deaf to all arguments. \n“I don’t care if they’re born as armadillos,” he begged .",

He found a woman with flaccid breasts, affectionate and \ncheap, who calmed his stomach for some time. He tried to  apply the treatment of \ndisdain to Amaranta. He would see her on the porch wo rking at the sewing \nmachine, which she had learned to operate with admi rable skill, and he would not \neven speak to her.

No one doubted the origins of t hat nameless child: he \nlooked exactly like the colonel at the time he was taken to  see ice for the first \ntime. The woman said that he had been born with his e yes open, looking at \npeople with the judgment of an adult, and that she was frightened by his way of \nstaring at things without blinking. “He’s identical,” Úrsula said. “The only thing \nmissing is for him to make chairs rock by simply looking at them.” They \nchristened him Aureliano and with his mother’s last name , since the law did not \npermit a person to bear his father’s name until he had  recognized him. General \nMoncada was the godfather. Although Amaranta insisted t hat he be left so that \nshe could take over his upbringing, his mother was against  it. Úrsula at that time \ndid not know about the custom of sending virgins to th e bedrooms of soldiers in \nthe same way that hens are turned loose with fine roost ers, but in the course of",
            "9": "that year she found out: nine more sons of Colonel Au reliano Buendía were \nbrought to the house to be baptized. The oldest, a str ange dark boy with green \neyes, who was not at all like his father’s family, was over  ten years old. They \nbrought children of all ages, all colors, but all male s and all with a look of solitude \nthat left no doubt as to the relationship. Only two st ood out in the group. One, \nlarge for his age, made smithereens out of the flowerp ots and china because his \nhands seemed to have the property of breaking everything  they touched. The \nother was a blond boy with the same light eyes as his moth er, whose hair had \nbeen left to grow long and curly like that of a woman . He entered the house with a \ngreat deal of familiarity, as if he had been raised th ere, and he went directly to a \nchest in Úrsula’s bedroom and demanded, “I want the me chanical ballerina.” \nÚrsula was startled. She opened the chest, searched among  t h e  a n c i e n t  a n d  \ndusty articles left from the days of Melquíades, and wrapp ed in a pair of stockings \nshe found the mechanical ballerina that Pietro Crespi had brought to the house \nonce and that everyone had forgotten about. In less tha n twelve years they \nbaptized with the name Aureliano and the last name o f the mother all the sons \nthat the colonel had implanted up and down his theate r of war: seventeen. At first \nÚrsula would fill their pockets with money and Amaranta tried to have them stay. \nBut they finally limited themselves to giving them prese nts and serving as \ngodmothers. “We’ve done our duty by baptizing them,” Ú rsula would say, jotting \ndown in a ledger the name and address of the mother a nd the place and date of \nbirth of the child. “Aureliano needs well-kept accounts so that he can decide \nthings when he comes back.” During lunch, commenting with  General Moncada \nabout that disconcerting proliferation, she expressed the  desire for Colonel \nAureliano Buendía to come back someday and gather all of  his sons together in \nthe house. \n“Don’t worry, dear friend,” General Moncada said enigm atically. “He’ll come \nsooner than you suspect.”",
            "10": "What General Moncada knew and what he did not wish t o reveal at lunch \nwas that Colonel Aureliano Buendía was already on his way to head up the most \nprolonged, radical, and bloody rebellion of all those he had started up till then. \nThe situation again became as tense as it had been duri ng the months that \npreceded the first war. The cockfights, instituted by the m ayor himself, were \nsuspended. Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the commander of th e garrison, took over \nthe exercise of municipal power. The Liberals looked upon him as a provocateur. \n“Something terrible is going to happen,” Úrsula woul d say to Aureliano José. \n“Don’t go out into the street after six o’clock.” The e ntreaties were useless. \nAureliano José, just like Arcadio in other times, had cease d to belong to her. It \nwas as if his return home, the possibility of existing wi thout concerning himself \nwith everyday necessities, had awakened in him the lewd an d lazy leanings of his \nuncle José Arcadio. His passion for Amaranta had been ext inguished without \nleaving any scars. He would drift around, playing pool, easing his solitude with \noccasional women, sacking the hiding places where Úrsula ha d forgotten her \nmoney. He ended up coming home only to change his cloth es. “They’re all alike,” \nÚrsula lamented. “At first they behave very well, they’ re obedient and prompt and \nthey don’t seem capable of killing a fly, but as soon as th eir beards appear they \ngo to ruin.” Unlike Arcadio, who had never known his r eal origins, he found out \nthat he was the son of Pilar Ternera, who had hung up  a hammock so that he \ncould take his siesta in her house. More than mother an d son, they were \naccomplices in solitude. Pilar Ternera had lost the trail  of all hope. Her laugh had \ntaken on the tones of an organ, her breasts had succumb ed to the tedium of \nendless caressing, her stomach and her thighs had been the  victims of her \nirrevocable fate as a shared woman, but her heart gr ew old without bitterness. \nFat, talkative, with the airs of a matron in disgrace,  she renounced the sterile \nillusions of her cards and found peace and consolation in  other people’s loves. In \nthe house where Aureliano José took his siesta, the girls from the neighborhood",
            "11": "would receive their casual lovers. “Lend me your room, Pilar,” they would simply \nsay when they were already inside. “Of course,” Pilar wou ld answer. And if \nanyone was present she would explain: \n“I’m happy knowing that people are happy in bed.” \nShe never charged for the service. She never refused th e favor, just as she \nnever refused the countless men who sought her out, even  in the twilight of her \nmaturity, without giving her money or love and only occa sionally pleasure. Her \nfive daughters, who inherited a burning seed, had bee n lost on the byways of life \nsince adolescence. Of the two sons she managed to raise, on e died fighting in \nthe forces of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and the other  was wounded and \ncaptured at the age of fourteen when he tried to stea l a crate of chickens in a \ntown in the swamp. In a certain way, Aureliano José was t he tall, dark man who \nhad been promised her for half a century by the king of  hearts, and like all men \nsent by the cards he reached her heart when he was alread y stamped with the \nmark of death. She saw it in the cards. \n“Don’t go out tonight,” she told him. “Stay and sleep  here because Carmelita \nMontiel is getting tired of asking me to put her in you r room.” \nAureliano José did not catch the deep feeling of beggi ng that was in the \noffer. \n“Tell her to wait for me at midnight” he said. He we nt to the theater, where a \nSpanish company was putting on The Dagger of the Fox , which was really \nZorzilla’s play with the title changed by order of Capt ain Aquiles Ricardo, because \nthe Liberals called the Conservatives Goths. Only when h e handed in his ticket at \nthe door did Aureliano José realize that Captain Aqui les Ricardo and two soldiers \narmed with rifles were searching the audience. \n“Be careful, captain,” Aureliano José warned him. “The man hasn’t been \nborn yet who can lay hands on me.” The captain tried to search him forcibly and \nAureliano José, who was unarmed, began to run. The sold iers disobeyed the",
            "12": "order to shoot. “He’s a Buendía,” one of them explaine d. Blind with rage, the \ncaptain then snatched away the rifle, stepped into the  center of the street, and \ntook aim.” \n“Cowards!” he shouted. “I only wish it was Colonel Aurel iano Buendía.” \nCarmelita Montiel, a twenty-year-old virgin, had just bathed in orange-\nblossom water and was strewing rosemary leaves on Pilar Te rnera’s bed when \nthe shot rang out. Aureliano José had been destined to find with her the \nhappiness that Amaranta had denied him, to have seven children, and to die in \nher arms of old age, but the bullet that entered his back and shattered his chest \nhad been directed by a wrong interpretation of the ca rds. Captain Aquiles \nRicardo, who was really the one destined to die that ni ght, did indeed die, four \nhours before Aureliano José. As won as the shot was heard he was brought \ndown by two simultaneous bullets whose origin was never e stablished and a \nshout of many voices shook the night. \n“Long live the Liberal party! Long live Colonel Aure liano Buendía!” \nAt twelve o’clock, when Aureliano, José had bled to deat h and Carmelita \nMontiel found that the cards showing her future were blank, more than four \nhundred men had filed past the theater and discharged  their revolvers into the \nabandoned body of Captain Aquiles Ricardo. A patrol ha d to use a wheelbarrow \nto carry the body, which was heavy with lead and fell ap art like a water-soaked \nloaf of bread. \nAnnoyed by the outrages of the regular army, General José  R a q u e l  \nMoncada used his political influence, put on his uniform again, and assumed the \ncivil and military leadership of Macondo. He did not ex pect, however, that his \nconciliatory attitude would be able to prevent the in evitable. The news in \nSeptember was contradictory. While the government annou nced that it was \nmaintaining control throughout the country, the Libera ls were receiving secret \nnews of armed uprisings in the interior. The regime w ould not admit a state of war",
            "13": "until it was proclaimed in a decree that had followed  a court-martial which had \ncondemned Colonel Aureliano Buendía to death in absen tia. The first unit that \ncaptured him was ordered to carry the sentence out. “Thi s means he’s come \nback,” Úrsula said joyfully to General Moncada. But he him self knew nothing \nabout it. \nActually, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been in the co untry for more than a \nmonth. He was preceded by conflicting rumors, supposed to be in the most \ndistant places at the same time, and even General Monca da did not believe in his \nreturn until it was officially announced that he had se ized two states on the coast. \n“Congratulations, dear friend,” he told Úrsula, show ing her the telegram. “You’ll \nsoon have him here.” Úrsula was worried then for the f irst time. “And what will \nyou do?” she asked. General Moncada had asked himself that same question \nmany times. \n“The same as he, my friend,” he answered. “I’ll do my du ty.” \nAt dawn on the first of October Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía attacked \nMacondo with a thousand well-armed men and the garriso n received orders to \nresist to the end. At noon, while General Moncada was l unching with Úrsula, a \nrebel cannon shot that echoed in the whole town blew  the front of the municipal \ntreasury to dust. “They’re as well armed as we are,” Ge neral Moncada sighed, \n“but besides that they’re fighting because they want to .” At two o’clock in the \nafternoon, while the earth trembled with the artill ery fire from both sides, he took \nleave of Úrsula with the certainty that he was fighting  a losing battle. \n“I pray to God that you won’t have Aureliano in the h ouse tonight,” he said. \n“If it does happen that way, give him an embrace for m e, because I don’t expect \never to see him again.” \nThat night he was captured when he tried to escape from  Macondo, after \nwriting a long letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía in which he reminded him of \ntheir common aim to humanize the war and he wished h im a final victory over the",
            "14": "corruption of the militarists and the ambitions of the politicians in both parties. On \nthe following day Colonel Aureliano Buendía had lunc h with him in Úrsula’s \nhouse, where he was being held until a revolutionary co urt-martial decided his \nfate. It was a friendly gathering. But while the adve rsaries forgot the war to \nremember things of the past, Úrsula had the gloomy feel ing that her son was an \nintruder. She had felt it ever since she saw him come i n protected by a noisy \nmilitary retinue, which turned the bedrooms inside o ut until they were convinced \nthere was no danger. Colonel Aureliano Buendía not o nly accepted it but he gave \nstrict orders that no one should come closer than ten fee t, not even Úrsula, while \nthe members of his escort finished placing guards about t he house. He was \nwearing an ordinary denim uniform with no insignia o f any kind and high boots \nwith spurs that were caked with mud and dried blood. On  his waist he wore a \nholster with the flap open and his hand, which was al ways on the butt of the \npistol, revealed the same watchful and resolute tension  as his look. His head, \nwith deep recessions in the hairline now, seemed to hav e been baked in a slow \noven. His face, tanned by the salt of the Caribbean, ha d acquired a metallic \nhardness. He was preserved against imminent old age by a  vitality that had \nsomething to do with the coldness of his insides. He was ta ller than when he had \nleft, paler and bonier, and he showed the first sympto ms of resistance to \nnostalgia. “Good Lord,” Úrsula said to herself. “Now he  looks like a man capable \nof anything.” He was. The Aztec shawl that he brought A maranta, the \nremembrances he spoke of at lunch, the funny stories her told were simple \nleftovers from his humor of a different time. As soon a s the order to bury the dead \nin a common grave was carried out, he assigned Colonel R oque Carnicero the \nminion of setting up courts-martial and he went ahead with the exhausting task of \nimposing radical reforms which would not leave a stone  of the reestablished \nConservative regime in place. “We have to get ahead of  the politicians in the \nparty,” he said to his aides. “When they open their eyes t o reality they’ll find",
            "15": "accomplished facts.” It was then that he decided to revie w the titles to land that \nwent back a hundred years and he discovered the legalized outrages of his \nbrother, José Arcadio. He annulled the registrations wit h a stroke of the pen. As a \nlast gesture of courtesy, he left his affairs for an hour  and visited Rebeca to bring \nher up to date on what he was determined to do. \nIn the shadows of her house, the solitary widow who at one time had been \nthe confidante of his repressed loves and whose persistence had saved his life \nwas a specter out of the past. Encased in black down to her  knuckles, with her \nheart turned to ash, she scarcely knew anything about the  war. Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía had the impression that the phosphorescence of he r bones was showing \nthrough her skin and that she moved in an atmosphere of Saint Elmo’s fire, in a \nstagnant air where one could still note a hidden smell of gunpowder. He began by \nadvising her to moderate the rigor of her mourning, t o ventilate the house, to \nforgive the world for the death of José Arcadio. But R ebeca was already beyond \nany vanity. After searching for it uselessly in the taste of  earth, in, the perfumed \nletters from Pietro Crespi, in the tempestuous bed of h er husband, she had found \npeace in that house where memories materialized throug h the strength of \nimplacable evocation and walked like human beings throug h the cloistered \nrooms, Leaning back in her wicker rocking chair, looking a t Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía as if he were the one who looked like a ghost o ut of the past, Rebeca \nwas not even upset by the news that the lands usurped by José Arcadio would be \nreturned to their rightful owners. \n“Whatever you decide will be done, Aureliano,” she sigh ed. “I always thought \nand now I have the proof that you’re a renegade.” \nThe revision of the deeds took place at the same time as t he summary \ncourts-martial presided over by Colonel Gerineldo Márque z, which ended with the \nexecution of all officers of the regular army who had  been taken prisoner by the \nrevolutionaries. The last court-martial was that of José  Raquel Moncada. Úrsula",
            "16": "intervened. ‘”His government was the best we’ve ever had  in Macondo,” she told \nColonel Aureliano Buendía. “I don’t have to tell you  anything about his good \nheart, about his affection for us, because you know bette r than anyone.” Colonel \nAureliano Buendía gave her a disapproving look. \n“I can’t take over the job of administering justice,” he  replied. “If you have \nsomething to say, tell it to the court-martial.” \nÚrsula not only did that she also brought all of the mothers of the \nrevolutionary officers who lived in Macondo to testify. O ne by one the old women \nwho had been founders of the town, several of whom ha d taken part in the daring \ncrossing of the mountains, praised the virtues of General  Moncada. Úrsula was \nthe last in line. Her gloomy dignity, the weight of he r name, the convincing \nvehemence of her declaration made the scale of justice h esitate for a moment. \n“You have taken this horrible game very seriously and you  h a v e  d o n e  w e l l  \nbecause you are doing your duty,” she told the members of  the court. “But don’t \nforget that as long as God gives us life we will still b e mothers and no matter how \nrevolutionary you may be, we have the right to pull do wn your pants and give you \na whipping at the first sign of disrespect.” The court re tired to deliberate as those \nwords still echoed in the school that had been turned into a barracks. At midnight \nGeneral José Raquel Moncada was sentenced to death. Colon el Aureliano \nBuendía, in spite of the violent recriminations of Úrsu la, refused to commute the \nsentence. A short while before dawn he visited the conde mned man in the room \nused as a cell. \n“Remember, old friend,” he told him. “I’m not shoot ing you. It’s the revolution \nthat’s shooting you.” \nGeneral Moncada did not even get up from the cot when  he saw him come \nin. \n“Go to hell, friend,” he answered.",
            "17": "Until that moment, ever since his return. Colonel Aure liano Buendía had not \ngiven himself the opportunity to see him with his heart . He was startled to see \nhow much he had aged, how his hands shook, and the rat her punctilious \nconformity with which he awaited death, and then he f elt a great disgust with \nhimself, which he mingled with the beginnings of pity.  \n“You know better than I,” he said, “that all courts-mar tial are farces and that \nyou’re really paying for the crimes of other people, b ecause this time we’re going \nto win the war at any price. Wouldn’t you have done th e same in my place?” \nGeneral Moncada, got up to clean his thick horn-rimmed g lasses on his \nshirttail. “Probably,” he said. “But what worries me is not your shooting me, \nbecause after all, for people like us it’s a natural de ath.” He laid his glasses on \nthe bed and took off his watch and chain. “What worri es me,” he went on, “is that \nout of so much hatred for the military, out of fighti ng them so much and thinking \nabout them so much, you’ve ended up as bad as they are. And no ideal in life is \nworth that much baseness.” He took off his wedding ring and the medal of the \nVirgin of Help and put them alongside his glasses and w atch. \n“At this rate,” he concluded, “you’ll not only be the mo st despotic and bloody \ndictator in our history, but you’ll shoot my dear friend  Ú r su l a  i n  an  a t t e m p t  t o  \npacify your conscience.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía stood there impassively. Gen eral Moncada then \ngave him the glasses, medal, watch, and ring and he cha nged his tone. \n“But I didn’t send for you to scold you,” he said. “I wa nted to ask you the \nfavor of sending these things to my wife.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía put them in his pockets. \n“Is she still in Manaure?” \n“She’s still in Manaure,” General Moncada confirmed, “ in the same house \nbehind the church where you sent the letter.” \n“I’ll be glad to, José Raquel,” Colonel Aureliano Bue ndía said.",

            "0": "COLONEL GERINELDO MÁRQUEZ was the first to perceive th e emptiness \nof the war. In his position as civil and military lead er of Macondo he would have \ntelegraphic conversations twice a week with Colonel Aurel iano Buendía. At first \nthose exchanges would determine the course of a flesh-an d-blood war, the \nperfectly defined outlines of which told them at any mo ment the exact spot -where \nit was and the prediction of its future direction. Alth ough he never let himself be \npulled into the area of confidences, not even by his close st friends, Colonel \nAureliano Buendía still had at that time the familia r tone that made it possible to \nidentify him at the other end of the wire. Many times he would prolong the talk \nbeyond the expected limit and let them drift into comm ents of a domestic nature. \nLittle by little, however, and as the war became more intense and widespread, his \nimage was fading away into a universe of unreality. The  characteristics of his \nspeech were more and more uncertain, and they cam toget her and combined to \nform words that were gradually losing all meaning. C olonel Gerineldo Márquez \nlimited himself then to just listening, burdened by the  impression that he was in \ntelegraphic contact with a stranger from another world.  \n“I understand, Aureliano,” he would conclude on the key.  “ L o n g  l i v e  t h e  \nLiberal party!” \nHe finally lost all contact with the war. What in other  times had been a real \nactivity, an irresistible passion of his youth, became a remo te point of reference \nfor him: an emptiness. His only refuge was Amaranta’s sewi ng room. He would \nvisit her every afternoon. He liked to watch her hands as she curled frothy \npetticoat cloth in the machine that was kept in motion by Remedios the Beauty. \nThey spent many hours without speaking, content with thei r reciprocal company, \nbut while Amaranta was inwardly pleased in keeping the fire of his devotion alive,",
            "1": "he was unaware of the secret designs of that indecipherab le heart. When the \nnews of his return reached her, Amaranta had been smot hered by anxiety. But \nwhen she saw him enter the house in the middle of Col onel Aureliano Buendía’s \nnoisy escort and she saw how he had been mistreated by the  rigors of exile, \nmade old by age and oblivion, dirty with sweat and dust , smelling like a herd, \nugly, with his left arm in a sling, she felt faint wit h disillusionment. “My God,” she \nthought. “This wasn’t the person I was waiting for.” O n the following day, \nhowever, he came back to the house shaved and clean, wit h his mustache \nperfumed with lavender water and without the bloody  sling. He brought her a \nprayer book bound in mother-of-pearl. \n“How strange men are,” she said, because she could not th ink of anything \nelse to say. “They spend their lives fighting against prie sts and then give prayer \nbooks as gifts.” \nFrom that time on, even during the most critical days o f the war, he visited \nher every afternoon. Many times, when Remedios the Beau ty was not present, it \nwas he who turned the wheel on the sewing machine. Am aranta felt upset by the \nperseverance, the loyalty, the submissiveness of that man who was invested with \nso much authority and who nevertheless took off his sidear m in the living room so \nthat he could go into the sewing room without weapons,  But for four years he kept \nrepeating his love and she would always find a way to re ject him without hurting \nhim, for even though she had not succeeded in loving hi m she could no longer \nlive without him. Remedios the Beauty, who seemed indi fferent to everything and \nwho was thought to be mentally retarded, was not insens itive to so much devo-\ntion and she intervened in Colonel Gerineldo Marque z's favor. Amaranta \nsuddenly discovered that the girl she had raised, who wa s just entering \nadolescence, was already the most beautiful creature that had even been seen in \nMacondo. She felt reborn in her heart the rancor that  she had felt in other days \nfor Rebeca, and begging God not to impel her into th e extreme state of wishing",
            "2": "her dead, she banished her from the sewing room. It w as around that time that \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez began to feel the boredom  of the war. He summoned \nhis reserves of persuasion, his broad and repressed tende rness, ready to give up \nfor Amaranta a glory that had cost him the sacrifice of h is best years. But he \ncould not succeed in convincing her. One August afternoon , overcome by the \nunbearable weight of her own obstinacy, Amaranta locked herself in her bedroom \nto weep over her solitude unto death after giving her  final answer to her tenacious \nsuitor: \n“Let’s forget about each other forever,” she told him . “We’re too old for this \nsort of thing now.” \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez had a telegraphic call fro m Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía that afternoon. It was a routine conversation which was not going to \nbring about any break in the stagnant war. At the end,  C o l o n e l  G e r i n e l d o  \nMárquez looked at the desolate streets, the crystal water on the almond trees, \nand he found himself lost in solitude. \n“Aureliano,” he said sadly on the key, “it’s raining in M acondo.” \nThere was a long silence on the line. Suddenly the appa ratus jumped with \nthe pitiless letters from Colonel Aureliano Buendía. \n“Don’t be a jackass, Gerineldo,” the signals said. “It’s na tural for it to be \nraining in August.” \nThey had not seen each other for such a long time that  C ol onel  Gerin el do \nMárquez was upset by the aggressiveness of the reaction. Tw o months later, \nhowever, when Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned to Macondo, his upset was \nchanged to stupefaction. Even Úrsula was surprised at ho w much he had \nchanged. He came with no noise, no escort, wrapped in a cloak in spite of the \nheat, and with three mistresses, whom he installed in th e same house, where he \nspent most of his time lying in a hammock. He scarcely read the telegraphic \ndispatches that reported routine operations. On one occas ion Colonel Gerineldo",
            "3": "Márquez asked him for instructions for the evacuation of  a spot on the border \nwhere there was a danger that the conflict would become  an international affair. \n“Don’t bother me with trifles,” he ordered him. “Con sult Divine Providence.” \nIt was perhaps the most critical moment of the war. The Liberal landowners, \nwho had supported the revolution in the beginning, h ad made secret alliances \nwith the Conservative landowners in order to stop the revision of property titles. \nThe politicians who supplied funds for the war from e xile had Publicly repudiated \nthe drastic aims of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, but eve n that withdrawal of \nauthorization did not seem to bother him. He had not  r e t u r n e d  t o  r e a d i n g  h i s  \npoetry, which filled more than five volumes and lay fo rgotten at the bottom of his \ntrunk. At night or at siesta time he would call one of his women to his hammock \nand obtain a rudimentary satisfaction from her, and the n he would sleep like a \nstone that was not concerned by the slightest indication of  worry. Only he knew at \nthat time that his confused heart was condemned to uncer tainty forever. At first, \nintoxicated by the glory of his return, by his remarkable v ictories, he had peeped \ninto the abyss of greatness. He took pleasure in keeping b y his right hand the \nDuke of Marlborough, his great teacher in the art of w ar, whose attire of skins and \ntiger claws aroused the respect of adults and the awe of children. It was then that \nhe decided that no human being, not even Úrsula, coul d come closer to him than \nten feet. In the center of the chalk circle that his a ides would draw wherever he \nstopped, and which only he could enter, he would deci de with brief orders that \nhad no appeal the fate of the world. The first time that he was in Manaure after \nthe shooting of General Moncada, he hastened to fulfi ll his victim’s last wish and \nthe widow took the glasses, the medal, the watch, and th e ring, but she would not \nlet him in the door. \n“You can’t come in, colonel,” she told him. “You may be  in command of your \nwar, but I’m in command of my house.”",

He found all types: idealists, \nambitious people, adventurers, those with social resentm ents, even common \ncriminals. There was even a former Conservative functio nary who had taken \nrefuge in the revolt to escape a judgment for misappro priation of funds.

General Teófilo Varg as came forward with his \nintentions: in a few hours he shattered the coalition of better-qualified \ncommanders and took charge of the main command. “He’s a w ild beast worth \nwatching,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía told his officers.  “That man is more \ndangerous to us than the Minister of War.” Then a very young captain who had \nalways been outstanding for his timidity raised a cautious index finger. \n“It’s quite simple, colonel,” he proposed. “He has to be  killed.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía was not alarmed by the coldn ess of the \nproposition but by the way in which, by a fraction of a second, it had anticipated \nhis own thoughts. \n“Don’t expect me to give an order like that,” he said.  \nHe did not give it, as a matter of fact. But two wee ks later General Teófilo \nVargas was cut to bits by machetes in an ambush and Colon el Aureliano Buendía \nassumed the main command. The same night that his autho rity was recognized",
            "6": "by all the rebel commands, he woke up in a fright, calli ng for a blanket. An inner \ncoldness which shattered his bones and tortured him even in the heat of the sun \nwould not let him sleep for several months, until it b ecame a habit. The intoxica-\ntion of power began to break apart under waves of disco mfort. Searching for a \ncure against the chill, he had the young officer who ha d proposed the murder of \nGeneral Teófilo Vargas shot. His orders were being carr ied out even before they \nwere given, even before he thought of them, and they  always went much beyond \nwhat he would have dared have them do. Lost in the sol itude of his immense \npower, he began to lose direction. He was bothered by t he people who cheered \nhim in neighboring villages, and he imagined that the y were the same cheers they \ngave the enemy. Everywhere he met adolescents who looked at him with his own \neyes, who spoke to him with his own voice, who greeted hi m with the same \nmistrust with which he greeted them, and who said the y were his sons. He felt \nscattered about, multiplied, and more solitary than eve r. He was convinced that \nhis own officers were lying to him. He fought with the  Duke of Marlborough. “The \nbest friend a person has,” he would say at that time, “i s one who has just died.” \nHe was weary of the uncertainty, of the vicious circle of t hat eternal war that \nalways found him in the same place, but always older, wea rier, even more in the \nposition of not knowing why, or how, or even when. The re was always someone \noutside of the chalk circle. Someone who needed money, someone who had a \nson with whooping cough, or someone who wanted to go off and sleep forever \nbecause he could not stand the shit taste of the war in  his mouth and who, \nnevertheless, stood at attention to inform him: “Everyth ing normal, colonel.” And \nnormality was precisely the most fearful part of that inf inite war: nothing ever \nhappened. Alone, abandoned by his premonitions, fleein g the chill that was to \naccompany him until death, he sought a last refuge in Ma condo in the warmth of \nhis oldest memories. His indolence was so serious that when they announced the \narrival of a commission from his party that was authoriz ed to discuss the",

Úrsula put them up in her house. They spent \nthe greater part of the day closeted in the bedroom in  hermetic conferences and \nat dusk they asked for an escort and some accordion players and  took over Cata-\nrino’s store. “Leave them alone,” Colonel Aureliano B uendía ordered. “After all, I \nknow what they want.” At the beginning of December the  long-awaited interview, \nwhich many had foreseen as an interminable argument, w as resolved in less than \nan hour. \nIn the hot parlor, beside the specter of the pianola s hrouded in a white sheet, \nColonel Aureliano Buendía did not sit down that tim e inside the chalk circle that \nhis aides had drawn. He sat in a chair between his poli tical advisers and, \nwrapped in his woolen blanket, he listened in silence t o the brief proposals of the \nemissaries. They asked first that he renounce the revision o f property titles in \norder to get back the support of the Liberal landowner s. They asked, secondly, \nthat he renounce the fight against clerical influence in  order to obtain the support \nof the Catholic masses. They asked, finally, that he renou nce the aim of equal \nrights for natural and illegitimate children in orde r to preserve the integrity of the \nhome. \n“That means,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said, smiling when the reading \nwas over, “that all we’re fighting for is power.” \n“They’re tactical changes,” one of the delegates replie d. “Right now the main \nthing is to broaden the popular base of the war. Then  we’ll have another look.” \nOne of Colonel Aureliano Buendía’s political advisers hastened to intervene. \n“It’s a contradiction” he said. “If these changes are good , it means that the \nConservative regime is good. If we succeed in broadening the popular base of",
            "8": "the war with them, as you people say, it means that the regime his a broad \npopular base. It means, in short, that for almost twen ty years we’ve been fighting \nagainst the sentiments of the nation.” \nHe was going to go on, but Colonel Aureliano Buendía  stopped him with a \nsignal. “Don’t waste your time, doctor.” he said. “The i mportant thing is that from \nnow on we’ll be fighting only for power.” Still smil ing, he took the documents the \ndelegates gave him and made ready to sign them. \n“Since that’s the way it is,” he concluded, “we have no o bjection to \naccepting.” \nHis men looked at one another in consternation. “Excuse me, colonel,” \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez said softly, “but this is a be trayal.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía held the inked pen in the  air and discharged the \nwhole weight of his authority on him. \n“Surrender your weapons,” he ordered. \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez stood up and put his sidearm s on the table. \n“Report to the barracks,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía or dered him. “Put \nyourself at the disposition of the revolutionary court.” \nThen he signed the declaration and gave the sheets of paper to the \nemissaries, saying to them: \n“Here an your papers, gentlemen. I hope you can get some  advantage out of \nthem.” \nTwo days later, Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, accused of h igh treason, was \ncondemned to death. Lying in his hammock, Colonel Aurel iano Buendía was \ninsensible to the pleas for clemency. On the eve of the execution, disobeying the \norder not to bother him, Úrsula visited him in his bedroom. Encased in black, \ninvested with a rare solemnity, she stood during the thr ee minutes of the \ninterview. “I know that you’re going to shoot Gerineld o,” she said calmly, “and that \nI can’t do anything to stop it. But I give you one warni ng: as soon as I see his",

He had had to start thirty-two wars and had had \nto violate all of his pacts with death and wallow like a hog in the dungheap of \nglory in order to discover the privileges of simplicity al most forty years late. \nAt dawn, worn out by the tormented vigil, he appeared  in the cell an hour \nbefore the execution. “The farce is over, old friend ,” he said to Colonel Gerineldo \nMárquez. “Let’s get out of here before the mosquitoes in here execute you.” \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez could not repress the disdain  that was inspired in him \nby that attitude. \n“No, Aureliano,” he replied. “I’d rather be dead th an see you changed into a \nbloody tyrant.” \n“You won’t see me,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía said. “ Put on your shoes \nand help me get this shitty war over with.” \nWhen he said it he did not know that it was easier to start a war than to end \none. It took him almost a year of fierce and bloody eff ort to force the government \nto propose conditions of peace favorable to the rebels a nd another year to \nconvince his own partisans of the convenience of accepting th em. He went to \ninconceivable extremes of cruelty to put down the rebelli on of his own officers,",

The  certainty that he was \nfinally fighting for his own liberation and not for a bstract ideals, for slogans that \npoliticians could twist left and right according to the c ircumstances, filled him with \nan ardent enthusiasm. Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who  fought for defeat with as \nmuch conviction and loyalty as he had previously fought f or victory, reproached \nhim for his useless temerity. “Don’t worry,” he would sa y, smiling. “Dying is much \nmore difficult than one imagines.” In his case it was tr ue. The certainty that his \nday was assigned gave him a mysterious immunity, an immorta lity or a fixed \nperiod that made him invulnerable to the risks of war a nd in the end permitted him \nto win a defeat that was much more difficult, much mo re bloody and costly than \nvictory. \nIn almost twenty years of war, Colonel Aureliano Buendí a had been at his \nhouse many times, but the state of urgency with which he always arrived, the \nmilitary retinue that accompanied him everywhere, the a ura of legend that glowed \nabout his presence and of which even Úrsula was aware, changed him into a \nstranger in the end. The last time that he was in Macon do and took a house for \nhis three concubines, he was seen in his own house only o n two or three occa-\nsions when he had the time to accept an invitation to di ne.

            "11": "“We’ll finally have a man in the house again,” Úrsula sa id. \nAmaranta was the first to suspect that they had lost him forever. One week \nbefore the armistice, when he entered the house withou t an escort, preceded by \ntwo barefoot orderlies who deposited on the porch the  saddle from the mule and \nthe trunk of poetry, all that was left of his former im perial baggage, she saw him \npass by the sewing room and she called to him. Colonel A ureliano Buendía had \ntrouble recognizing her. \n“It’s Amaranta,” she said good-humoredly, happy at his re turn, and she \nshowed him the hand with the black bandage. “Look.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía smiled at her the same way a s when he had first \nseen her with the bandage on that remote morning whe n he had come back to \nMacondo condemned to death. \n“How awful,” he said, “the way time passes!” \nThe regular army had to protect the house. He arrived amid insults, spat \nupon, accused of having accelerated the war in order t o sell it for a better price. \nHe was trembling with fever and cold and his armpits wer e studded with sores \nagain. Six months before, when she had heard talk abo ut the armistice, Úrsula \nhad opened up and swept out the bridal chamber and h ad burned myrrh in the \ncorners, thinking that he would come back ready to grow o ld slowly among \nRemedios’ musty dolls. But actually, during the last two ye ars he had paid his \nfinal dues to life, including growing old. When he p assed by the silver shop, which \nÚrsula had prepared with special diligence, he did not even notice that the keys \nwere in the lock. He did not notice the minute, tearin g destruction that time had \nwreaked on the house and that, after such a prolonged absence, would have \nlooked like a disaster to any man who had kept his memorie s alive. He was not \npained by the peeling of the whitewash on the walls o r the dirty, cottony cobwebs \nin the corners or the dust on the begonias or the veins l eft on the beams by the \ntermites or the moss on the hinges or any of the insidiou s traps that nostalgia",

He sat down on the porch, wrapped in hi s blanket and with his boots \nstill on, as if only waiting for it to clear, and he spe nt the whole afternoon watching \nit rain on the begonias. Úrsula understood then that t hey would not have him \nhome for long. “If it’s not the war,” she thought, “i t can only be death.” It was a \nsupposition that was so neat, so convincing that she identi fied it as a premonition. \nThat night, at dinner, the supposed Aureliano Segund o broke his bread with \nhis right hand and drank his soup with his left. His twin  brother, the supposed \nJosé Arcadio Segundo, broke his bread with his left hand and drank his soup with \nhis right. So precise was their coordination that they di d not look like two brothers \nsitting opposite each other but like a trick with mirror s. The spectacle that the \ntwins had invented when they became aware that they wer e equal was repeated \nin honor of the new arrival. But Colonel Aureliano Buendía did not notice it. He \nseemed so alien to everything that he did not even not ice Remedios the Beauty \nas she passed by naked on her way to her bedroom. Úrsula w as the only one \nwho dared disturb his, abstraction. \n“If you have to go away again,” she said halfway throug h dinner, “at least try \nto remember how we were tonight.” \nThen Colonel Aureliano Buendía realized, without su rprise, that Úrsula was \nthe only human being who had succeeded in penetrating his misery, and for the \nfirst time in many years he looked her in the face. Her ski n was leathery, her teeth \ndecayed, her hair faded and colorless, and her look frig htened. He compared her \nwith the oldest memory that he had of her, the aftern oon when he had the \npremonition that a pot of boiling soup was going to f all off the table, and he found \nher broken to pieces. In an instant he discovered the scrat ches, the welts, the \nsores, the ulcers, and the scan that had been left on he r by more than half a \ncentury of daily life, and he saw that those damages did not even arouse a feeling \nof pity in him. Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place \nwhere his affection had rotted away and he could not f ind it. On another occasion,",
            "13": "he felt at least a confused sense of shame when he found  the smell of Úrsula on \nhis own skin, and more than once he felt her thoughts in terfering with his. But all \nof that had been wiped out by the war. Even Remedios,  his wife, at that moment \nwas a hazy image of someone who might have been his dau ghter. The countless \nwomen he had known on the desert of love and who ha d spread his seed all \nalong the coast had left no trace in his feelings. Most o f them had come into his \nroom in the dark and had left before dawn, and on th e following day they were \nnothing but a touch of fatigue in his bodily memory. T he only affection that \nprevailed against time and the war was that which he had felt for his brother José \nArcadio when they both were children, and it was not b ased on love but on \ncomplicity. \n“I’m sorry,” he excused himself from Úrsula’s request. “ It’s just that the war \nhas done away with everything.” \nDuring the following days he busied himself destroying al l trace of his \npassage through the world. He stripped the silver shop un til all that were left were \nimpersonal objects, he gave his clothes away to the orderl ies, and he buried his \nweapons in the courtyard with the same feeling of penan ce with which his father \nhad buried the spear that had killed Prudencio Aguilar . He kept only one pistol \nwith one bullet in it. Úrsula did not intervene. The  only time she dissuaded him \nwas when he was about to destroy the daguerreotype of Re medios that was kept \nin the parlor lighted by an eternal lamp. “That pictu re stopped belonging to you a \nlong time ago,” she told him. “It’s a family relic.” On  the eve of the armistice, when \nno single object that would let him be remembered was left in the house, he took \nthe trunk of poetry to the bakery when Santa Sofía de l a Piedad was making \nready to light the oven. \n“Light it with this,” he told her, handing her the f irst roll of yellowish papers. “It \nwill, burn better because they’re very old things.”",
            "14": "Santa Sofía de la Piedad, the silent one, the condescen ding one, the one \nwho never contradicted anyone, not even her own child ren, had the impression \nthat it was a forbidden act. \n“They’re important papers,” she said. \n“Nothing of the sort,” the colonel said. “They’re thing s that a person writes to \nhimself.” \n“In that case,” she said, “you burn them, colonel.” \nHe not only did that, but he broke up the trunk with a  h atch et and th rew th e \npieces into the fire. Hours before, Pilar Ternera had come to visit him. After so \nmany years of not seeing her, Colonel Aureliano Buendía  was startled at how old \nand fat she had become and how much she had lost of th e splendor of her laugh, \nbut he was also startled at the depths she had reached in her reading of the \ncards. “Watch out for your mouth,” she told him, and he wondered whether the \nother time she had told him that during the height of his glory it had not been a \nsurprisingly anticipated vision of his fate. A short time l ater, when his personal \nphysician finished removing his sores, he asked him, withou t showing any \nparticular interest, where the exact location of his hear t was. The doctor listened \nwith his stethoscope and then painted a circle on his c heat with a piece of cotton \ndipped in iodine. \nThe Tuesday of the armistice dawned warm and rainy. Colo nel Aureliano \nBuendía appeared in the kitchen before five o’clock and  had his usual black \ncoffee without sugar. “You came into the world on a da y like this,” Úrsula told him. \n“Everybody was amazed at your open eyes.” He did not pay a ny attention \nbecause he was listening to the forming of the troops, the sound of the comets, \nand the voices of command that were shattering the dawn . Even though after so \nmany years of war they should have sounded familiar to hi m this time he felt the \nsame weakness in his knees and the same tingling in his ski n that he had felt in \nhis youth in the presence of a naked woman. He thought co nfusedly, finally",

At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerine ldo Márquez came to fetch \nhim, in the company of a group of rebel officers, he f ound him more taciturn than \never, more pensive and solitary.

Úrsula put the bar on the \ndoor, having decided not to take it down for the rest of her life. “We’ll rot in here,” \nshe thought. “We’ll turn to ashes in this house without  men, but we won’t give this \nmiserable town the pleasure of seeing us weep.” She spe nt the whole morning \nlooking for a memory of her son in the most hidden corne rs, but she could find \nnone. \nThe ceremony took place fifteen miles from Macondo in the  s h a d e  o f  a  \ngigantic ceiba tree around which the town of Neerland ia would be founded later. \nThe delegates from the government and the party and t he commission of the \nrebels who were laying down their arms were served by a  noisy group of novices \nin white habits who looked like a flock of doves that ha d been frightened by the \nrain. Colonel Aureliano Buendía arrived on a muddy m ule. He had not shaved, \nmore tormented by the pain of the sores than by the gre at failure of his dreams, \nfor he had reached the end of all hope, beyond  glory and the nostalgia of glory.",
            "16": "In accordance with his arrangements there was no music, no fireworks, no \npealing bells, no shouts of victory, or any other manife station that might alter the \nmournful character of the armistice. An itinerant phot ographer who took the only \npicture of him that could have been preserved was forced  to smash his plates \nwithout developing them. \nThe ceremony lasted only the time necessary to sign the doc uments. Around \nthe rustic table placed in the center of a patched circus t ent where the delegates \nsat were the last officers who were faithful to Colonel  Aureliano Buendía. Before \ntaking the signatures, the personal delegate of the pre sident of the republic tried \nto read the act of surrender aloud, but Colonel Aurel iano Buendía was against it. \n“Let’s not waste time on formalities,” he said and prep ared to sign the papers \nwithout reading them. One of his officers then broke th e soporific silence of the \ntent. \n“Colonel,” he said, “please do us the favor of not bei ng the first to sign.” \nColonel Aureliano Buendía acceded. When the documents went all around \nthe table, in the midst of a silence that was so pure th at one could have \ndeciphered the signatures from the scratching of the pen on the paper, the first \nline was still blank. Colonel Aureliano Buendía prepar ed to fill it. \n“Colonel,” another of his officers said, “there’s still t ime for everything to \ncome out right.” \nWithout changing his expression, Colonel Aureliano Bu endía signed the first \ncopy. He had not finished signing the last one when a rebel colonel appeared in \nthe doorway leading a mule carrying two chests. In spite o f his entire youth he \nhad a dry look and a patient expression. He was the trea surer of the revolution in \nthe Macondo region. He had made a difficult journey o f six days, pulling along the \nmule, who was dying of hunger, in order to arrive at  the armistice on time. With \nan exasperating parsimony he took down the chests, opened  them, and placed \non the table, one by one, seventy-two gold bricks, Everyone  h ad forgotten  abou t",
            "17": "the existence of that fortune. In the disorder of the p ast year, when the central \ncommand fell apart and the revolution degenerated in to a bloody rivalry of \nleaders, it was impossible to determine any responsibili ty. The gold of the \nrevolution, melted into blocks that were then covered wi th baked clay, was \nbeyond all control. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had the  seventy-two gold bricks \nincluded in the inventory of surrender and closed the ceremony without allowing \nany speeches. The filthy adolescent stood opposite him, lo oking into his eyes \nwith his own calm, syrup-colored eyes. \n“Something else?” Colonel Aureliano Buendía asked him . \nThe young colonel tightened his mouth. \n“The receipt,” he said. \nColonel Aureliano Buendía wrote it out in his own ha nd. Then he had a glass \nof lemonade and a piece of biscuit that the novices wer e passing around and \nretired to a field tent which had been prepared for  him in case he wished to rest. \nThere he took off his shirt, sat on the edge of the cot , and at three-fifteen in the \nafternoon took his pistol and shot himself in the iodin e circle that his personal \nphysician had painted on his chest. At that moment in M acondo Úrsula took the \ncover off the pot of milk on the stove, wondering why i t was taking so long to boil, \nand found it full of worms. \n“They’ve killed Aureliano,” she exclaimed. \nShe looked toward the courtyard, obeying a habit of her  solitude, and then \nshe saw José Arcadio Buendía, soaking wet and sad in the ra in and much older \nthan when he had died. “They shot him in the back,” Úr sula said more precisely, \n“and no one was charitable enough to close his eyes.” At d usk through her tears \nshe saw the swift and luminous disks that crossed the sky like a n exhalation and \nshe thought that it was a signal of death.

The \nsame people who invented the story that he had sold the  w a r  f o r  a  r o o m  w i t h  \nwalls made of gold bricks defined the attempt at suicid e as an act of honor and \nproclaimed him a martyr. Then, when he rejected the Or der of Merit awarded him \nby the president of the republic, even his most bitter e nemies filed through the \nroom asking him to withdraw recognition of the armistice  and to start a new war. \nThe house was filled with gifts meant as amends.

In that telegram \nwhich was never made public, he denounced the first viol ation of the Treaty of \nNeerlandia and threatened to proclaim war to the dea th if the assignment of \npensions was not resolved within two weeks. His attitude was so just that it \nallowed him to hope even for the support of former Conservative combatants. But \nthe only reply from the government was the reinforcemen t of the military guard \nthat had been placed at the door of his house with th e pretext of protecting him, \nand the prohibition of all types of visits, Similar meth ods were adopted all through \nthe country with other leaders who bore watching. It wa s an operation that was so \ntimely, drastic, and effective that two months after the  armistice, when Colonel \nAureliano Buendía had recovered, his most dedicated con spirators were dead or \nexiled or had been assimilated forever into public admi nistration. \nColonel Aureliano Buendía left his room in December a nd it was sufficient for \nhim to look at the porch in order not to think about war again. With a vitality that \nseemed impossible at her age, Úrsula had rejuvenated t he house again. “Now \nthey’re going to see who I am,” she said when she saw t hat her son was going to \nlive. “There won’t be a better, more open house in a ll the world than this \nmadhouse.” She had it washed and painted, changed th e furniture, restored the \ngarden and planted new flowers, and opened doors and windows so that the \ndazzling light of summer would penetrate even into th e bedrooms. She decreed \nan end to the numerous superimposed periods of mourni ng and she herself ex-\nchanged her rigorous old gowns for youthful clothing. Th e music of the pianola \nagain made the house merry. When she heard it, Amaran ta thought of Pietro \nCrespi, his evening gardenia, and his smell of lavender,  and in the depths of her \nwithered heart a clean rancor flourished, purified by t ime. One afternoon when \nshe was trying to put the parlor in order, Úrsula asked for the help of the soldiers \nwho were guarding the house. The young commander of th e guard gave them",
            "20": "permission. Little by little, Úrsula began assigning th em new chores.

            "0": "YEARS LATER on his deathbed Aureliano Segundo would remember the \nrainy afternoon in June when he went into the bedro om to meet his first son. \nEven though the child was languid and weepy, with no mark of a Buendía, he did \nnot have to think twice about naming him. \n“We’ll call him José Arcadio,” he said. \nFernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman he had mar ried the year before, \nagreed. Úrsula, on the other hand, could not conceal a  vague feeling of doubt. \nThroughout the long history of the family the insistent repetition of names had \nmade her draw some conclusions that seemed to be certain. While the \nAurelianos were withdrawn, but with lucid minds, the Jo sé Arcadios were \nimpulsive and enterprising, but they were marked with a  tragic sign. The only \ncases that were impossible to classify were those of José Arcad io Segundo and \nAureliano Segundo. They were so much alike and so misc hievous during \nchildhood that not even Santa Sofía de la Piedad cou ld tell them apart. On the \nday of their christening Amaranta put bracelets on them  with their respective \nnames and dressed them in different colored clothing ma rked with each one’s \ninitials, but when they began to go to school they decid ed to exchange clothing \nand bracelets and call each other by opposite names. The teacher, Melchor \nEscalona, used to knowing José Arcadio Segundo by his gree n shirt, went out of \nhis mind when he discovered that the latter was wearing  A u r e l i an o  S e gu n d o ’ s \nbracelet and that the other one said, nevertheless, tha t his name was Aureliano \nSegundo in spite of the fact that he was wearing the w hite shirt and the bracelet \nwith José Arcadio Segundo’s name. From then on he was ne ver sure who was \nwho. Even when they grew up and life made them diffe rent. Úrsula still wondered \nif they themselves might not have made a mistake in some moment of their",

They wo uld wake up at \nthe same time, have the urge to go to the bathroom a t the same time, suffer the \nsame upsets in health, and they even dreamed about the sa me things. In the \nhouse, where it was thought that they coordinated their  actions with a simple \ndesire to confuse, no one realized what really was happe ning until one day when \nSanta Sofía de la Piedad gave one of them a glass of lemonade and as soon as \nhe tasted it the other one said that it needed sugar.  S an ta S ofía de l a P i edad, \nwho had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonad e, told Úrsula about it. \n“That’s what they’re all like,” she said without surprise . “crazy from birth.” In time \nthings became less disordered. The one who came out of th e game of confusion \nwith the name of Aureliano Segundo grew to monument al size like his \ngrandfathers, and the one who kept the name of José Ar cadio Segundo grew to \nbe bony like the colonel, and the only thing they had in common was the family’s \nsolitary air. Perhaps it was that crossing of stature, name s, and character that \nmade Úrsula suspect that they had been shuffled like a d eck of cards since \nchildhood. \nThe decisive difference was revealed in the midst of th e war, when José \nArcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo Márquez to let  him see an execution. \nAgainst Úrsula’s better judgment his wishes were satisfie d. Aureliano Segundo, \non the other hand, shuddered at the mere idea of wi tnessing an execution. He \npreferred to stay home. At the age of twelve he asked Úrsula what was in the \nlocked room. “Papers,” she answered. “Melquíades’ books and  the strange things \nthat he wrote in his last years.” Instead of calming him,  the answer increased his \ncuriosity. He demanded so much, promised with such ins istence that he would \nnot mistreat the things, that Úrsula, gave him the ke ys. No one had gone into the \nroom again since they had taken Melquíades’ body out and  had put on the door a \npadlock whose parts had become fused together with rust. B ut when Aureliano",

O n the shelves were \nthe books bound in a cardboard-like material, pale, l ike tanned human skin, and \nthe manuscripts were intact. In spite of the room’s having  been shut up for many \nyears, the air seemed fresher than in the rest of the h ouse. Everything was so \nrecent that several weeks later, when Úrsula went into t he room with a pail of \nwater and a brush to wash the floor, there was nothin g for her to do. Aureliano \nSegundo was deep in the reading of a book. Although i t had no cover and the title \ndid not appear anywhere, the boy enjoyed the story of a woman who sat at a \ntable and ate nothing but kernels of rice, which she p icked up with a pin, and the \nstory of the fisherman who borrowed a weight for his ne t from a neighbor and \nwhen he gave him a fish in payment later it had a d iamond in its stomach, and the \none about the lamp that fulfilled wishes and about f lying carpets. Surprised, he \nasked Úrsula if all that was true and she answered him t hat it was, that many \nyears ago the gypsies had brought magic lamps and flying ma ts to Macondo. \n“What’s happening,” she sighed, “is that the world is slo wly coming to an end \nand those things don’t come here any more.” \nWhen he finished the book, in which many of the storie s had no endings \nbecause there were pages missing, Aureliano Segundo set  about deciphering the \nmanuscripts. It was impossible. The letters looked like clot hes hung out to dry on \na line and they looked more like musical notation than writing. One hot noontime, \nwhile he was poring over the, manuscripts, he sensed that  he was not alone in \nthe room. Against the light from the window, sitting with his hands on his knees, \nwas Melquíades. He was under forty years of age. He was we aring the same old-",

Melquíades talked to him about the world, tried to infuse him with his \nold wisdom, but he refused to translate the manuscripts.  “No one must know their \nmeaning until he has reached one hundred years of age,”  he explained. Aureliano \nkept those meetings secret forever. On one occasion he felt  that his private world \nhad fallen apart because Úrsula came in when Melquíad es was in the room. But \nshe did not see him. \n“Who were you talking to?” she asked him. \n“Nobody,” Aureliano Segundo said. \n“That’s what your great-grandfather did,” Úrsula, said.  “He used to talk to \nhimself too.” \nJosé Arcadio Segundo, in the meantime, had satisfied his wish to see a \nshooting. For the rest of his life he would remember t he livid flash of the six \nsimultaneous shots-and the echo of the discharge as it b roke against the hills and \nthe sad smile and perplexed eyes of the man being shot , who stood erect while \nhis shirt became soaked with blood, and who was still smi ling even when they \nuntied him from the post and put him in a box filled  with quicklime. “He’s alive,” he \nthought. “They’re going to bury him alive.” It made su ch an impression on him \nthat from then on he detested military practices and war , not because of the \nexecutions but because of the horrifying custom of buryin g the victims alive.

When Colonel \nGerineldo Márquez found out he scolded him strongly for  learning occupations \nrepudiated by the Liberals. “The fact is,” he answered, “I think I’ve turned out to \nbe a Conservative.” He believed it as if it had been  determined by fate. Colonel \nGerineldo Márquez, scandalized, told Úrsula about it. \n“It’s better that way,” she approved. “Let’s hope that  he becomes a priest so \nthat God will finally come into this house.” \nIt was soon discovered that Father Antonio Isabel was pre paring him for his \nfirst communion. He was teaching him the catechism as he shaved the necks of \nhis roosters. He explained to him with simple examples, as he put the brooding \nhens into their nests, how it had occurred to God on t he second day of creation \nthat chickens would be formed inside of an egg. From th at time on the parish \npriest began to show the signs of senility that would le ad him to say years later \nthat the devil had probably won his rebellion against God, and that he was the \none who sat on the heavenly throne, without revealing his true identity in order to \ntrap the unwary. Warmed up by the persistence of his ment or, in a few months \nJosé Arcadio Segundo came to be as adept in theological t ricks used to confuse \nthe devil as he was skilled in the tricks of the cockpit. Ama ranta made him a linen \nsuit with a collar and tie, bought him a pair of whit e shoes, and engraved his \nname in gilt letters on the ribbon of the candle. Two  nights before the first com-\nmunion, Father Antonio Isabel closeted himself with hi m in the sacristy to hear his \nconfession with the help of a dictionary of sins. It was su ch a long list that the \naged priest, used to going to bed at six o’clock, fell a sleep in his chair before it \nwas over. The interrogation was a revelation for José A rcadio Segundo. It did not \nsurprise him that the priest asked him if he had done ba d things with women, and \nhe honestly answered no, but he was upset with the questi on as to whether he",
            "5": "had done them with animals. The first Friday in May he received communion, \ntortured by curiosity. Later on he asked Petronio, the si ckly sexton who lived in \nthe belfry and who, according to what they said, fed him self on bats, about it, and \nPetronio, answered him: “There are some corrupt Christi ans who do their \nbusiness with female donkeys.” José Arcadio Segundo still sh owed so much \ncuriosity and asked so many questions that Petronio lost his patience. \n“I go Tuesday nights,” he confessed. “if you promise not to tell anyone I’ll \ntake you next Tuesday.” \nIndeed, on the following Tuesday Petronio came down ou t of the tower with \na wooden stool which until then no one had known the  use of, and he took José \nArcadio Segundo to a nearby pasture. The boy became so t aken with those \nnocturnal raids that it was a long time before he was se en at Catarino’s. He \nbecame a cockfight man. “Take those creatures somewhere else ,” Úrsula \nordered him the first time she saw him come in with hi s fine fighting birds. \n“Roosters have already brought too much bitterness to th is house for you to bring \nus any more.” José Arcadio Segundo took them away without any argument, but \nhe continued breeding them at the house of Pilar Tern era, his grandmother, who \ngave him everything he needed in exchange for having him in her house. He \nsoon displayed in the cockpit the wisdom that Father Anton io Isabel had given \nhim, and he made enough money not only to enrich hi s brood but also to look for \na man’s satisfactions. Úrsula compared him with his brothe r at that time and \ncould not understand how the twins, who looked like the same person in \nchildhood, had ended up so differently. Her perplexity d id not last very long, for \nquite soon Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of la ziness and dissipation. \nWhile he was shut up in Melquíades’ room he was drawn  into himself the way \nColonel Aureliano Buendía had been in his youth. But a short time after the \nTreaty of Neerlandia, a piece of chance took him out of  his withdrawn self and \nmade him face the reality of the world. A young woman who was selling numbers",
            "6": "for the raffle of an accordion greeted him with a gre at deal of familiarity. Aureliano \nSegundo was not surprised, for he was frequently confused with his brother. But \nhe did not clear up the mistake, not even when the gir l tried to soften his heart \nwith sobs, and she ended taking him to her room. She l iked him so much from \nthat first meeting that she fixed things so that he w ould win the accordion in the \nraffle. At the end of two weeks Aureliano Segundo rea lized that the woman had \nbeen going to bed alternately with him and his brothe r, thinking that they were the \nsame man, and instead of making things clear, he arrang ed to prolong the \nsituation. He did not return to Melquíades’ room. He would spend his afternoons \nin the courtyard, learning to play the accordion by ear over the protests of Úrsula, \nwho at that time had forbidden music in the house beca use of the mourning and \nwho, in addition, despised the accordion as an instrument  worthy only of the \nvagabond heirs of Francisco the Man. Nevertheless, Aurelia no Segundo became \na virtuoso on the accordion and he still was after he ha d married and had children \nand was one of the most respected men in Macondo. \nFor almost two months he shared the woman with his bro ther. He would \nwatch him, mix up his plans, and when he was sure that  José Arcadio Segundo \nwas not going to visit their common mistress that night, h e would go and sleep \nwith her. One morning he found that he was sick. Two da ys later he found his \nbrother clinging to a beam in the bathroom, soaked in sweat and with tears \npouring down, and then he understood. His brother conf essed to him that the \nwoman had sent him away because he had given her what s he called a low-life \nsickness. He also told him how Pilar Ternera had tried to cure him. Aureliano \nSegundo submitted secretly to the burning baths of perm anganate and to diuretic \nwaters, and both were cured separately after three mon ths of secret suffering. \nJosé Arcadio Segundo did not see the woman again. Aurel iano Segundo \nobtained her pardon and stayed with her until his deat h.",
            "7": "Her name was Petra Cotes. She had arrived in Macondo i n the middle of the \nwar with a chalice husband who lived off raffles, and w hen the man died she kept \nup the business. She was a clean young mulatto woman wit h yellow almond-\nshaped eyes that gave her face the ferocity of a panther,  but she had a generous \nheart and a magnificent vocation for love. When Úrsul a realized that José Arcadio \nSegundo was a cockfight man and that Aureliano Segundo played the accordion \nat his concubine’s noisy parties, she thought she would go  m a d  w i t h  t h e  \ncombination. It was as if the defects of the family and  none of the virtues had \nbeen concentrated in both. Then she decided that no one again would be called \nAureliano or José Arcadio. Yet when Aureliano Segundo had his first son she did \nnot dare go against his will. \n“All right,” Úrsula said, “but on one condition: I wil l bring him up.” \nAlthough she was already a hundred years old and on the  p oi n t  o f  g o i n g  \nblind from cataracts, she still had her physical dynamism, h er integrity of \ncharacter, and her mental balance intact. No one would be better able than she to \nshape the virtuous man who would restore the prestige o f the family, a man who \nwould never have heard talk of war, fighting cocks, bad women, or wild \nundertakings, four calamities that, according to what Úrsu la thought, had \ndetermined the downfall. of their line. “This one w ill be a priest,” she promised \nsolemnly. “And if God gives me life he’ll be Pope somed ay.” They all laughed \nwhen they heard her, not only in the bedroom but all through the house, where \nAureliano Segundo’s rowdy friends were gathered. The war, relegated to the attic \nof bad memories, was momentarily recalled with the popp ing of champagne \nbottles. \n“To the health of the Pope,” Aureliano Segundo toast ed. \nThe guests toasted in a chorus. Then the man of the hou se played the \naccordion, fireworks were set off, and drums celebrated th e event throughout the \ntown. At dawn the guests, soaked in champagne, sacrificed six cows and put",
            "8": "them in the street at the disposal of the crowd. No one  was scandalized. Since \nAureliano Segundo had taken charge of the house those festivities were a \ncommon thing, even when there was no motive as proper as the birth of a Pope. \nIn a few years, without effort, simply by luck, he had accu mulated one of the \nlargest fortunes in the swamp thanks to the supernatura l proliferation of his \nanimals. His mares would bear triplets, his hens laid twi ce a day, and his hogs \nfattened with such speed that no one could explain su ch disorderly fecundity \nexcept through the use of black magic. “Save something no w,” Úrsula would tell \nher wild great-grandson. “This luck is not going to last  all your life.” But Aureliano \nSegundo paid no attention to her. The more he opene d champagne to soak his \nfriends, the more wildly his animals gave birth and the  more he was convinced \nthat his lucky star was not a matter of his conduct but an influence of Petra Cotes, \nhis concubine, whose love had the virtue of exasperating  nature. So convinced \nwas he that this was the origin of his fortune that he  never kept Petra Cotes far \naway from his breeding grounds and even when he marrie d and had children he \ncontinued living with her with the consent of Fernanda.  Solid, monumental like his \ngrandfathers, but with a joie de vivre and an irresist ible good humor that they did \nnot have, Aureliano Segundo scarcely had time to look af ter his animals. All he \nhad to do was to take Petra Cores to his breeding groun ds and have her ride \nacross his land in order to have every animal marked with  his brand succumb to \nthe irremediable plague of proliferation. \nLike all the good things that occurred in his long life , that tremendous fortune \nhad its origins in chance. Until the end of the wars Pe tra Cotes continued to \nsupport herself with the returns from her raffles and A ureliano Segundo was able \nto sack Úrsula’s savings from time to time. They were a fri volous couple, with no \nother worries except going to bed every night, even on  forbidden days, and \nfrolicking there until dawn. “That woman has been your ruination,” Úrsula would \nshout at her great-grandson when she saw him coming int o the house like a",
            "9": "sleepwalker. “She’s got you so bewitched that one of these  days I’m going to see \nyou twisting around with colic and with a toad in your b elly.” José Arcadio \nSegundo, who took a long time to discover that he had been supplanted, was \nunable to understand his brother’s passion. He remembere d Petra Cotes as an \nordinary woman, rather lazy in bed, and completely la cking in any resources for \nlovemaking. Deaf to Úrsula’s clamor and the teasing of his brother, Aureliano \nSegundo only thought at that time of finding a trade  t h a t  w o u l d  a l l o w  h i m  t o  \nmaintain a house for Petra Cotes, and to die with her , on top of her and under-\nneath her, during a night of feverish license. When Co lonel Aureliano Buendía \nopened up his workshop again, seduced at last by the peacef ul charms of old \nage, Aureliano Segundo thought that it would be goo d business to devote himself \nto the manufacture of little gold fishes. He spent man y hours in the hot room \nwatching how the hard sheets of metal, worked by the col onel with the \ninconceivable patience of disillusionment, were slowly bei ng converted into \ngolden scales. The work seemed so laborious to him and th e thought of Petra \nCotes was so persistent and pressing that after three weeks he disappeared from \nthe workshop. It was during that time that it occurred to Petra Cotes to raffle off \nrabbits. They reproduced and grew up so fast that there was barely time to sell \nthe tickets for the raffle. At first Aureliano Segundo did not notice the alarming \nproportions of the proliferation. But one night, whe n nobody in town wanted to \nhear about the rabbit raffle any more, he heard a no ise by the courtyard door. \n“Don’t get worried,” Petra, Cotes said. “It’s only the rabbits.” They could not sleep, \ntormented by the uproar of the animals. At dawn Aurel iano Segundo opened the \ndoor and saw the courtyard paved with rabbits, blue in the glow of dawn. Petra \nCotes, dying with laughter, could not resist the temptat ion of teasing him. \n“Those are the ones who were born last night,” she aid.  \n“Oh my God!” he said. “Why don’t you raffle off cows?”",
            "10": "A few days later, in an attempt to clean out her court yard, Petra Cotes \nexchanged the rabbits for a cow, who two months later gave birth to triplets. That \nwas how things began. Overnight Aureliano Segundo be.  came the owner of land \nand livestock and he barely had time to enlarge his over flowing barns and \npigpens. It was a delirious prosperity that even made hi m laugh, and he could not \nhelp doing crazy things to release his good humor. “Cease , cows, life is short,” he \nwould shout. Úrsula wondered what entanglements he ha d got into, whether he \nmight be stealing, whether he had become a rustler, an d every time she saw him \nuncorking champagne just for the pleasure of pouring the  foam over his head, \nshe would shout at him and scold him for the waste. It annoyed him so much that \none day when he awoke in a merry mood, Aureliano Segun do appeared with a \nchest full of money, a can of paste, and a brush, and si nging at the top of his \nlungs the old songs of Francisco the Man, he papered the  house inside and out \nand from top to bottom, with one-peso banknotes. The old mansion, painted white \nsince the time they had brought the pianola, took on th e strange look of a \nmosque. In the midst of the excitement of the family t he scandalization of Úrsula, \nthe joy of the people cramming the street to watch that  apotheosis of squan-\ndering. Aureliano Segundo finished by papering the h ouse from the front to the \nkitchen, including bathrooms and bedrooms, and threw the  leftover bills into the \ncourtyard. \n“Now,” he said in a final way, “I hope that nobody in this house ever talks to \nme about money again.” \nThat was what happened. Úrsula had the bills taken down , stuck to great \ncakes of whitewash, and the house was painted white again . “Dear Lord,” she \nbegged, “make us poor again the way we were when we fo unded this town so \nthat you will not collect for this squandering in the ot her life.” Her prayers were \nanswered in reverse. One of the workmen removing the bi lls bumped into an \nenormous plaster statue of Saint Joseph that someone had left in the house",
            "11": "during the last years of the war and the hollow figure  broke to pieces on the floor. \nIt had been stuffed with gold coins. No one could remem ber who had brought that \nlife-sized saint. “Three men brought it,” Amaranta ex plained. “They asked us to \nkeep it until the rains were over and I told them to put it there in the corner where \nnobody would bump into it, and there they put it, ver y carefully, and there it’s \nbeen ever since because they never came back for it.” Late r on, Úrsula had put \ncandles on it and had prostrated herself before it, not  suspecting that instead of a \nsaint she was adoring almost four bundled pounds of go ld. The tardy evidence of \nher involuntary paganism made her even more upset. She  spat on the spectac-\nular pile of coins, put them in three canvas sacks, and bur ied them in a secret \nplace, hoping that sooner or later the three unknown men would come to reclaim \nthem. Much later, during the difficult years of her de crepitude, Úrsula would \nintervene in the conversations of the many travelers who  came by the house at \nthat time and ask them if they had left a plaster Saint  Joseph there during the war \nto be taken care of until the rains passed. \nThings like that which gave Úrsula such consternation, were commonplace \nin those days. Macondo was swamped in a miraculous prosper ity. The adobe \nhouses of the founders had been replaced by brick building s with wooden blinds \nand cement floors which made the suffocating heat of t wo o’clock in the afternoon \nmore bearable. All that remained at that time of José  Arcadio Buendía’s ancient \nvillage were the dusty almond trees, destined to resist t he most arduous of \ncircumstances, and the river of clear water whose prehistor ic stones had been \npulverized by the frantic hammers of José Arcadio Segundo  when he set about \nopening the channel in order to establish a boat lin e. It was a mad dream, \ncomparable to those of his great-grandfather, for the rocky riverbed and the \nnumerous rapids prevented navigation from Macondo to t he sea. But José \nArcadio Segundo, in an unforeseen burst of temerity, st ubbornly kept on with the \nproject. Until then he had shown no sign of imaginati on. Except for his precarious",
            "12": "adventure with Petra Cotes, he had never known a wom an. Úrsula had \nconsidered him the quietest example the family had eve r produced in all its \nhistory, incapable of standing out even as a handler of  fighting cocks, when \nColonel Aureliano Buendía told him the story of the S panish galleon aground \neight miles from the sea, the carbonized frame of whi ch he had seen himself \nduring the war. The story, which for so many years had seem ed fantastic to so \nmany people, was a revelation for José Arcadio Segundo. He auctioned off his \nroosters to the highest bidder, recruited men, bought t ools, and set about the \nawesome task of breaking stones, digging canals, clearing aw ay rapids, and even \nharnessing waterfalls. “I know all of this by heart,” Ú rsula would shout. “It’s as if \ntime had turned around and we were back at the beginn ing.” When he thought \nthat the river was navigable, José Arcadio Segundo gave  his brother a detailed \naccount of his plans and the latter gave him the money h e needed for the \nenterprise. He disappeared for a long time. It had be en said that his plan to buy a \nboat was nothing but a trick to make off with his brothe r’s money when the news \nspread that a strange craft was approaching the town. Th e inhabitants of \nMacondo, who no longer remembered the colossal undertaki ngs of José Arcadio \nBuendía, ran to the riverbank and saw with eyes popping  in disbelief the arrival of \nthe first and last boat ever to dock in the town. It wa s nothing but a log raft drawn \nby thick ropes pulled by twenty men who walked along the b ank. In the prow, with \na glow of satisfaction in his eyes, José Arcadio Segundo wa s directing the \narduous maneuver. There arrived with him a rich group  of splendid matrons who \nwere protecting themselves from the burning sun with gaudy parasols, and wore \non their shoulders fine silk kerchiefs, with colored cream s on their faces and \nnatural flowers in their hair and golden serpents on t heir arms and diamonds in \ntheir teeth. The log raft was the only vessel that José Arcadio Segundo was able \nto bring to Macondo, and only once, but he never recog nized the failure of his \nenterprise, but proclaimed his deed as a victory of wil l power. He gave a",

The only thing that remained of that unf ortunate venture was the \nbreath of renovation that the matrons from France bro ught, as their magnificent \narts transformed traditional methods of love and their sense of social well-being \nabolished Catarino’s antiquated place and turned the street into a bazaar of \nJapanese lanterns and nostalgic hand organs. They were t he promoters of the \nbloody carnival that plunged Macondo into delirium for  three days and whose only \nlasting consequence was having given Aureliano Segundo t he opportunity to \nmeet Fernanda del Carpio. \nRemedios the Beauty was proclaimed queen. Úrsula, who sh uddered at the \ndisquieted beauty of her great-granddaughter, could no t prevent the choice. Until \nthen she had succeeded in keeping her off the streets un less it was to go to mass \nwith Amaranta, but she made her cover her face with a black shawl. The most \nimpious men, those who would disguise themselves as priests to say sacrilegious \nmasses in Catarino’s store, would go to church with an ai m to see, if only for an \ninstant, the face of Remedios the Beauty, whose legendar y good looks were \nspoken of with alarming excitement throughout the swam p. It was a long time \nbefore they were able to do so, and it would have bee n better for them if they \nnever had, because most of them never recovered their p eaceful habits of sleep. \nThe man who made it possible, a foreigner, lost his se renity forever, became \ninvolved in the sloughs of abjection and misery, and yea rs later was cut to pieces \nby a train after he had fallen asleep on the tracks. Fr om the moment he was seen \nin the church, wearing a green velvet suit and an e mbroidered vest, no one \ndoubted that he came from far away, perhaps from some distant city outside of \nthe country, attracted by the magical fascination of Remed ios the Beauty. He was \nso handsome, so elegant and dignified, with such presen ce, that Pietro Crespi \nwould have been a mere fop beside him and many women whispered with \nspiteful smiles that he was the one who really should ha ve worn the shawl. He did",
            "14": "not speak to anyone in Macondo. He appeared at dawn on Sunday like a prince \nin a fairy tale, riding a horse with silver stirrups an d a velvet blanket, and he left \ntown after mass. \nThe power of his presence was such that from the first t ime he was seen in \nthe church everybody took it for granted that a silent a nd tense duel had been \nestablished between him and Remedios the Beauty, a secre t pact, an irrevocable \nchallenge that would end not only in love but also in  death. On the sixth Sunday \nthe gentleman appeared with a yellow rose in his hand.  He heard mass standing, \nas he always did, and at the end he stepped in front of  Remedios the Beauty and \noffered her the solitary rose. She took it with a natur al gesture, as if she had been \nprepared for that homage, and then she uncovered her  face and gave her thanks \nwith a smile. That was all she did. Not only for the  gentleman, but for all the men \nwho had the unfortunate privilege of seeing her, tha t was an eternal instant. \nFrom then on the gentleman had a band of musicians pl ay beside the \nwindow of Remedios the Beauty, sometimes until dawn. Au reliano Segundo was \nthe only one who felt a cordial compassion for him and h e tried to break his \nperseverance. “Don’t waste your time any more,” he told him one night. “The \nwomen in this house are worse than mules.” He offered h im his friendship, invited \nhim to bathe in champagne, tried to make him understa nd that the females of his \nfamily had insides made of flint, but he could not we aken his obstinacy. \nExasperated by the interminable nights of music, Colone l Aureliano Buendía \nthreatened to cure his affliction with a few pistol sh ots. Nothing made him desist \nexcept his own lamentable state of demoralization. Fro m a well-dressed and neat \nindividual he became filthy and ragged. It was rumored  that h e h ad abandon ed \npower and fortune in his distant nation, although his origins were actually never \nknown. He became argumentative, a barroom brawler, an d he would wake up \nrolling in his own filth in Catarino’s store. The sadde st part of his drama was that \nRemedios the Beauty did not notice him not even when h e appeared in church",
            "15": "dressed like a prince. She accepted the yellow rose without  the least bit of \nmalice, amused, rather, by the extravagance of the act, and she lifted her shawl \nto see his face better, not to show hers. \nActually, Remedios the Beauty was not a creature of this w orld. Until she \nwas well along in puberty Santa Sofía de la. Piedad h ad to bathe and dress her, \nand even when she could take care of herself it was necessa ry to keep an eye on \nher so that she would not paint little animals on the  walls with a stick daubed in \nher own excrement. She reached twenty without knowing  h o w  t o  r e a d  o r  w r i t e ,  \nunable to use the silver at the table, wandering naked through the house because \nher nature rejected all manner of convention. When th e young commander of the \nguard declared his love for her, she rejected him simp ly because his frivolity \nstartled her. “See how simple he is,” she told Amarant a. “He says that he’s dying \nbecause of me, as if I were a bad case of colic.” When, i ndeed, they found him \ndead beside her window, Remedios the Beauty confirmed h er first impression. \n“You see,” she commented. “He was a complete Simpleton.”  \nIt seemed as if some penetrating lucidity permitted her  to see the reality of \nthings beyond any formalism. That at least was the poin t of view of Colonel \nAureliano Buendía, for whom Remedios the Beauty was in  no way mentally \nretarded, as was generally believed, but quite the op posite. “It’s as if she’s come \nback from twenty years of war,” he would say. Úrsula, for her part, thanked God \nfor having awarded the family with a creature of excep tional purity, but at the \nsame time she was disturbed by her beauty, for it seemed a contradictory virtue \nto her, a diabolical trap at the center of her innoce nce. It was for that reason that \nshe decided to keep her away from the world, to protect  h e r  f r o m  a l l  e a r t h l y  \ntemptation, not knowing that Remedios the Beauty, eve n from the time when she \nwas in her mother’s womb, was safe from any contagion. It  n ev e r  e n t e r e d  h e r  \nhead that they would elect her beauty queen of the carn ival pandemonium. But \nAureliano, Segundo, excited at the caprice of disguisi ng himself as a tiger,",
            "16": "brought Father Antonio Isabel to the house in order t o convince Úrsula that the \ncarnival was not a pagan feast, as she said, but a Cathol ic tradition. Finally \nconvinced, even though reluctantly, she consented to the cor onation. \nThe news that Remedios Buendía was going to be the sover eign ruler of the \nfestival went beyond the limits of the swamp in a few h ours, reached distant \nplaces where the prestige of her beauty was not known, a nd it aroused the \nanxiety of those who still thought of her last name as a symbol of subversion. The \nanxiety was baseless. If anyone had become harmless at that time it was the \naging and disillusioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía, w ho was slowly losing all \ncontact with the reality of the nation. Enclosed in his workshop, his only rela-\ntionship with the rest of the world was his business in l ittle gold fishes. One of the \nsoldiers who had guarded his house during the first days o f peace would go sell \nthem in the villages of the swamp and return loaded do wn with coins and news. \nThat the Conservative government, he would say, with th e backing of the \nLiberals, was reforming the calendar so that every presid ent could remain in \npower for a hundred years. That the concordat with the Holy See had finally been \nsigned and a cardinal had come from Rome with a crown o f diamonds and a \nthrone of solid gold, and that the Liberal ministers h ad had their pictures taken on \ntheir knees in the act of kissing his ring. That the lead ing lady of a Spanish \ncompany passing through the capital had been kidnapped b y a band of masked \nhighwaymen and on the following Sunday she had danced in the nude at the \nsummer house of the president of the republic. “Don’t t alk to me about politics,” \nthe colonel would tell him. “Our business is selling lit tle fishes.” The rumor that he \ndid not want to hear anything about the situation in the country because he was \ngrowing rich in his workshop made Úrsula laugh when i t reached her ears. With \nher terrible practical sense she could not understand the  colonel’s business as he \nexchanged little fishes for gold coins and then convert ed the coins into little \nfishes, and so on, with the result that he had to work all the harder with the more",
            "17": "he sold in order to satisfy an exasperating vicious circle . Actually, what interested \nhim was not the business but the work. He needed so much concentration to link \nscales, fit minute rubies into the eyes, laminate gills, and put on fins that there \nwas not the smallest empty moment left for him to fill with his disillusionment of \nthe war. So absorbing was the attention required by t he delicacy of his artistry \nthat in a short time he had aged more than during al l the years of the war, and his \nposition had twisted his spine and the close work had used  up his eyesight, but \nthe implacable concentration awarded him with a peace o f the spirit. The last time \nhe was seen to take an interest in some matter related t o the war was when a \ngroup of veterans from both parties sought his support for the approval of lifetime \npensions, which had always been promised and were always about to be put into \neffect. “Forget about it,” he told them. “You can see how I refuse my pension in \norder to get rid of the torture of waiting for it u ntil the day I died.” At first Colonel \nGerineldo Márquez would visit him at dusk and they would  both sit in the street \ndoor and talk about the past. But Amaranta could not b ear the memories that that \nman, whose baldness had plunged him into the abyss of pre mature old age, \naroused in her, and she would torment him with snide  remarks until he did not \ncome back except on special occasions and he finally disappear ed, extinguished \nby paralysis. Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new brea th of vitality that was \nshaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendía could und erstand only that the \nsecret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with  solitude. He would get \nup at five in the morning after a light sleep, have his eternal mug of bitter coffee in \nthe kitchen, shut himself up all day in the workshop, a nd at four in the afternoon \nhe would go along the porch dragging a stool, not eve n noticing the fire of the \nrose bushes or the brightness of the hour or the persist ence of Amaranta, whose \nmelancholy made the noise of a boiling pot, which wa s perfectly perceptible at \ndusk, and he would sit in the street door as long as the mosquitoes would allow \nhim to. Someone dared to disturb his solitude once.",
            "18": "“How are you, Colonel?” he asked in passing. \n“Right here,” he answered. “Waiting for my funeral pr ocession to pass.” \nSo that the anxiety caused by the public reappearance of his family name, \nhaving to do with the coronation of Remedios the Beaut y, was baseless. Many \npeople did not think that way, however. Innocent of th e tragedy that threatened it, \nthe town poured into the main square in a noisy explosi on of merriment. The \ncarnival had reached its highest level of madness and Aur eliano Segundo had \nsatisfied at last his dream of dressing up like a tiger an d was walking along the \nwild throng, hoarse from so much roaring, when on the  swamp road a parade of \nseveral people appeared carrying in a gilded litter th e most fascinating woman \nthat imagination could conceive. For a moment the inh abitants of Macondo took \noff their masks in order to get a better look at the da zzling creature with a crown \nof emeralds and an ermine cape, who seemed invested wit h legitimate authority, \nand was not merely a sovereign of bangles and crepe pape r. There were many \npeople who had sufficient insight to suspect that it was a question of provocation. \nBut Aureliano Segundo immediately conquered his perple xity and declared the \nnew arrivals to be guests of honor, and with the wisdom  of Solomon he seated \nRemedios the Beauty and the intruding queen on the sam e dais. Until midnight \nthe strangers, disguised as Bedouins, took part in the del irium and even enriched \nit with sumptuous fireworks and acrobatic skills that mad e one think of the art of \nthe gypsies. Suddenly, during the paroxysm of the celebr ation, someone broke \nthe delicate balance. \n“Long live the Liberal party!” he shouted. “Long liv e Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía!” \nThe rifle shots drowned out the splendor of the firew orks and the cries of \nterror drowned out the music and joy turned into pani c. Many years later there \nwere those who still insisted that the royal guard of t he intruding queen was a \nsquad of regular army soldiers who were concealing govern ment-issue rifles",
            "19": "under their rich Moorish robes. The government denie d the charge in a special \nproclamation and promised a complete investigation of t he bloody episode. But \nthe truth never came to light, and the version always p revailed that the royal \nguard, without provocation of any kind, took up combat p ositions upon a signal \nfrom their commander and opened fire without pity on the crowd. When calm was \nrestored, not one of the false Bedouins remained in to wn and there were many \ndead and wounded lying on the square: nine clowns, four  Columbines, seventeen \nplaying-card kings, one devil, three minstrels, two peers of France, and three \nJapanese empresses. In the confusion of the panic José Arcadio  S e g u n d o  \nmanaged to rescue Remedios the Beauty and Aureliano Seg undo carried the \nintruding queen to the house in his arms, her dress torn  and the ermine cape \nstained with blood. Her name was Fernanda del Carpio.  She had been chosen as \nthe most beautiful of the five thousand most beautiful  women in the land and they \nhad brought her to Macondo with the promise of naming  h e r  Q u e e n  o f  \nMadagascar. Úrsula took care of her as if she were her ow n daughter. The town, \ninstead of doubting her innocence, pitied her candor. S ix months after the \nmassacre, when the wounded had recovered and the last flo wers on the mass \ngrave had withered, Aureliano Segundo went to fetch her from the distant city \nwhere she lived with her father and he married her i n Macondo with a noisy \ncelebration that lasted twenty days."

            "0": "THE MARRIAGE was on the point of breaking up after t wo months because \nAureliano Segundo, in an attempt to placate Petra C otes, had a picture taken of \nher dressed as the Queen of Madagascar. When Fernanda fo und out about it she \nrepacked her bridal trunks and left Macondo without saying  good-bye. Aureliano \nSegundo caught up with her on the swamp road. After m uch pleading and \npromises of reform he succeeded in getting her to come h ome and he abandoned \nhis concubine. \nPetra Cotes, aware of her strength, showed no signs of worry. She had \nmade a man of him. While he was still a child she had  d r a w n  h i m  o u t  o f  \nMelquíades’ room, his head full of fantastic ideas and  lacking any contact with \nreality, and she had given him a place in the world. Nat ure had made him \nreserved and withdrawn. with tendencies toward solitar y meditation, and she had \nmolded an opposite character in him, one that was vit al, expansive, open, and \nshe had injected him with a joy for living and a pleas ure in spending and \ncelebrating until she had converted him inside and out , into the man she had \ndreamed of for herself ever since adolescence. Then he m arried, as all sons \nmarry sooner or later. He did not dare tell her the n ews. He assumed an attitude \nthat was quite childish under the circumstances, feigni ng anger and imaginary \nresentment so that Petra Cotes would be the one who w ould bring about the \nbreak. One day, when Aureliano Segundo reproached her  unjustly, she eluded \nthe trap and put things in their proper place. \n“What it all means,” she said, “is that you want to marr y the queen.” \nAureliano Segundo, ashamed, pretended an attack of ra ge, said that he was \nmisunderstood and abused, and did not visit her again.  Petra Cotes, without \nlosing her poise of a wild beast in repose for a single instant, heard the music and",
            "1": "the fireworks from the wedding, the wild bustle of the  celebration as if all of it \nwere nothing but some new piece of mischief on the pa rt of Aureliano Segundo. \nThose who pitied her fate were calmed with a smile. “ Don’t worry,” she told them. \n“Queens run errands for me.” To a neighbor woman who brought her a set of \ncandles so that she could light up the picture of her lo st lover with them, she said \nwith an enigmatic security: \n“The only candle that will make him come is always lighte d.” \nJust as she had foreseen, Aureliano Segundo went back to h er house as \nsoon as the honeymoon was over. He brought his usual ol d friends, a traveling \nphotographer, and the gown and ermine cape soiled wit h blood that Fernanda \nhad worn during the carnival. In the heat of the mer riment that broke out that \nevening, he had Petra Cotes dress up as queen, crowned h er absolute and \nlifetime ruler of Madagascar, and handed out copies of the picture to his friends, \nshe not only went along with the game, but she felt so rry for him inside, thinking \nthat he must have been very frightened to have conceived  o f  t h a t  e x t r a v ag an t  \nmeans of reconciliation. At seven in the evening, still dressed as the queen, she \nreceived him in bed. He had been married scarcely two mo nths, but she realized \nat once that things were not going well in the nuptia l bed, and she had the \ndelicious pleasure of vengeance fulfilled. Two days lat er, however, when he did \nnot dare return but sent an intermediary to arrange t he terms of the separation, \nshe understood that she was going to need more patience  than she had foreseen \nbecause he seemed ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of appearances. Nor \ndid she get upset that time. Once again she made thi ngs easy with a submission \nthat confirmed the generalized belief that she was a p oor devil, and the only \nsouvenir she kept of Aureliano Segundo was a pair of pa tent leather boots, \nwhich, according to what he himself had said, were the ones he wanted to wear \nin his coffin. She kept them wrapped in cloth in the b ottom of a trunk and made \nready to feed on memories, waiting without despair.",
            "2": "“He has to come sooner or later,” she told herself, “eve n if it’s just to put on \nthose boots.” \nShe did not have to wait as long as she had imagined.  Actually, Aureliano \nSegundo understood from the night of his wedding that  h e  w ou l d  r e t u rn  t o  t h e  \nhouse of Petra Cotes much sooner than when he would ha ve to put on the patent \nleather boots: Fernanda was a woman who was lost in the  world. She had been \nborn and raised in a city six hundred miles away, a gl oomy city where on ghostly \nnights the coaches of the viceroys still rattled through th e cobbled streets, Thirty-\ntwo belfries tolled a dirge at six in the afternoon. In the manor house, which was \npaved with tomblike slabs, the sun was never seen. The a ir had died in the \ncypresses in the courtyard, in the pale trappings of the b edrooms, in the dripping \narchways of the garden of perennials. Until puberty Fern anda had no news of the \nworld except for the melancholy piano lessons taken in som e neighboring house \nby someone who for years and years had the drive not to t ake a siesta. In the \nroom of her sick mother, green and yellow under the po wdery light from the \nwindowpanes, she would listen to the methodical, stubbo rn, heartless scales and \nthink that that music was in the world while she was be ing consumed as she \nwove funeral wreaths. Her mother, perspiring with fiv e-o’clock fever, spoke to her \nof the splendor of the past. When she was a little gir l, on one moonlit night \nFernanda saw a beautiful woman dressed in white crossing  th e garden  toward \nthe chapel. What bothered her most about that fleeti ng vision was that she felt it \nwas exactly like her, as if she had seen herself twenty years in advance. “It was \nyour great-grandmother the queen,” her mother told h er during a truce in her \ncoughing. “She died of some bad vapors while she was cu tting a string of bulbs.” \nMany years later, when she began to feel she was the eq ual of her great-\ngrandmother, Fernanda doubted her childhood vision, but her mother scolded her \ndisbelief.",
            "3": "“We are immensely rich and powerful,” she told her. “ One day you will be a \nqueen.” \nShe believed it, even though they were sitting at the  l on g tabl e wi th  a l inen  \ntablecloth and silver service to have a cup of watered  chocolate and a sweet bun. \nUntil the day of her wedding she dreamed about a leg endary kingdom, in spite of \nthe fact that her father, Don Fernando, had to mortg age the house in order to buy \nher trousseau. It was not innocence or delusions of grande ur. That was how they \nhad brought her up. Since she had had the use of reaso n she remembered \nhaving done her duty in a gold pot with the family crest  on it. She left the house \nfor the first time at the age of twelve in a coach an d horses that had to travel only \ntwo blocks to take her to the convent. Her classmates were su rprised that she sat \napart from them in a chair with a very high back and th at she would not even \nmingle with them during recess. “She’s different,” the nuns would explain. “She’s \ngoing to be a queen.” Her schoolmates believed this beca use she was already \nthe most beautiful, distinguished, and discreet girl th ey had ever seen. At the end \nof eight years, after having learned to write Latin p oetry, play the clavichord, talk \nabout falconry with gentlemen and apologetics, with arc hbishops, discuss affairs \nof state with foreign rulers and affairs of God with t he Pope, she returned to her \nparents’ home to weave funeral wreaths. She found it despoiled. All that was left \nwas the furniture that was absolutely necessary, the silver  candelabra and table \nservice, for the everyday utensils had been sold one by on e to underwrite the \ncosts of her education. Her mother had succumbed to five -o’clock fever. Her \nfather, Don Fernando, dressed in black with a stiff colla r and a gold watch chain, \nwould give her a silver coin on Mondays for the household  expenses, and the \nfuneral wreaths finished the week before would be ta ken away. He spent most of \nhis time shut up in his study and the few times that he went out he would return to \nrecite the rosary with her. She had intimate friendshi ps with no one. She had \nnever heard mention of the wars that were bleeding t he country. She continued",
            "4": "her piano lessons at three in the afternoon. She had even began to lose the \nillusion of being a queen when two peremptory raps of  the knocker sounded at \nthe door and she opened it to a well-groomed milita ry officer with ceremonious \nmanners who had a scar on his cheek and a gold medal on his chest. He \ncloseted himself with her father in the study. Two hours later her father came to \nget her in the sewing room. “Get your things together, ” he told her. “You have to \ntake a long trip.” That was how they took her to Macond o. In one single day, with \na brutal slap, life threw on top of her the whole w eight of a reality that her parents \nhad kept hidden from her for many years. When she retu rned home she shut \nherself up in her room to weep, indifferent to Don F ernando’s pleas and \nexplanations as he tried to erase the scars of that strang e joke. She had sworn to \nherself never to leave her bedroom until she died wh en Aureliano Segundo came \nto get her. It was an act of impossible fate, because in the confusion of her \nindignation, in the fury of her shame, she had lied t o him so that he would never \nknow her real identity. The only real clues that Aureli ano Segundo had when he \nleft to look for her were her unmistakable highland acce nt and her trade as a \nweaver of funeral wreaths. He searched for her withou t cease. With the fierce \ntemerity with which José Arcadio Buendía had crossed the m ountains to found \nMacondo, with the blind pride with which Colonel Aur eliano Buendía had \nundertaken his fruitless wars, with the mad tenacity with  which Úrsula watched \nover the survival of the line, Aureliano Segundo loo ked for Fernanda, without a \nsingle moment of respite. When he asked where they sold f uneral wreaths they \ntook him from house to house so that he could choose the best ones. When he \nasked for the most beautiful woman who had ever been se en on this earth, all the \nwomen brought him their daughters. He became lost in m isty byways, in times re-\nserved for oblivion, in labyrinths of disappointment. H e crossed a yellow plain \nwhere the echo repeated one’s thoughts and where anxie ty brought on \npremonitory mirages. After sterile weeks he came to an un known city where all",
            "5": "the bells were tolling a dirge. Although he had neve r seen them and no one had \never described them to him he immediately recognized th e walls eaten away by \nbone salt, the broken-down wooden balconies gutted by f ungus, and nailed to the \noutside door, almost erased by rain, the saddest cardboard  sign in the world: \nFuneral Wreaths for Sale . From that moment until the icy morning when \nFernanda left her house under the care of the Mother Superior there was barely \nenough time for the nuns to sew her trousseau and in si x trunks put the \ncandelabra, the silver service, and the gold chamberpo t along with the countless \nand useless remains of a family catastrophe that had been two centuries late in \nits fulfillment. Don Fernando declined the invitation  to go along. He promised to \ngo later when he had cleared up his affairs, and from the moment when he gave \nhis daughter his blessing he shut himself up in his stud y again to write out the \nannouncements with mournful sketches and the family coat o f arms, which would \nbe the first human contact that Fernanda and her fathe r would have had in all \ntheir lives. That was the real date of her birth for her. For Aureliano Segundo it \nwas almost simultaneously the beginning and the end of happiness. \nFernanda carried a delicate calendar with small golden  keys on which her \nspiritual adviser had marked in purple ink the dates of venereal abstinence. Not \ncounting Holy week, Sundays, holy days of obligation, first Fridays, retreats, \nsacrifices, and cyclical impediments, her effective year was r educed to forty-two \ndays that were spread out through a web of purple crosses.  Aureliano Segundo, \nconvinced that time would break up that hostile network, prolonged the wedding \ncelebration beyond the expected time. Tired of throwing  out so many empty \nbrandy and champagne bottles so that they would not clut ter up the house and at \nthe same time intrigued by the fact that the newlyweds sl ept at different times and \nin separate rooms while the fireworks and music and the slaughtering of cattle \nwent on, Úrsula remembered her own experience and wo ndered whether Fer-\nnanda might have a chastity belt too which would sooner  or later provoke jokes in",
            "6": "the town and give rise to a tragedy. But Fernanda confe ssed to her that she was \njust letting two weeks go by before allowing the first co ntact with her husband. \nIndeed, when the period was over, she opened her bedr oom with a resignation \nworthy of an expiatory victim and Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful \nwoman on earth, with her glorious eyes of a frightened  a n i m a l  a n d  h e r  l o n g ,  \ncopper-colored hair spread out across the pillow. He was so  fascinated with that \nvision that it took him a moment to realize that Fer nanda was wearing a white \nnightgown that reached down to her ankles, with long sl eeves and with a large, \nround buttonhole, delicately trimmed, at the level of  her lower stomach. Aureliano \nSegundo could not suppress an explosion of laughter. \n“That’s the most obscene thing I’ve ever seen in my life, ” he shouted with a \nlaugh that rang through the house. “I married a Siste r of Charity.” \nA month later, unsuccessful in getting his wife to take o ff her nightgown, he \nhad the picture taken of Petra Cotes dressed as a queen. Later on, when he \nsucceeded in getting Fernanda to come back home, she gav e in to his urges in \nthe fever of reconciliation, but she could not give him the repose he had dreamed \nabout when he went to fetch her in the city with the t hirty-two belfries. Aureliano \nSegundo found only a deep feeling of desolation in he r. One night, a short time \nbefore their first child was born, Fernanda realized t hat her husband had returned \nin secret to the bed of Petra Cotes. \n“That’s what happened,” he admitted. And he explaine d in a tone of \nprostrated resignation: “I had to do it so that the an imals would keep on \nbreeding.” \nHe needed a little time to convince her about such a strange expedient, but \nwhen he finally did so by means of proofs that seemed irr efutable, the only \npromise that Fernanda demanded from him was that he s hould not be surprised \nby death in his concubine’s bed. In that way the three o f them continued living \nwithout bothering each other. Aureliano Segundo, pu nctual and loving with both",
            "7": "of them. Petra Cotes, strutting because of the reconcili ation, and Fernanda, \npretending that she did not know the truth. \nThe pact did not succeed, however, in incorporating Fern anda into the \nfamily. Úrsula insisted in vain that she take off the woolen ruff which she would \nhave on when she got up from making love and which m ade the neighbors \nwhisper. She could not convince her to use the bathroo m or the night lavatory \nand sell the gold chamberpot to Colonel Aureliano B uendía so that he could \nconvert it into little fishes. Amaranta felt so uncomfo rtable with her defective \ndiction and her habit of using euphemisms to designate everything that she would \nalways speak gibberish in front of her. \n“Thifisif.” she would say, “ifisif onefos ofosif thofosif  w h o s u f u  c a n t a n t a n t  \nstatantand thefesef smufumellu ofosif therisir owfisown sh ifisifit.” \nOne day, irritated by the mockery, Fernanda wanted to kno w what Amaranta \nwas saying, and she did not use euphemisms in answering h er. \n“I was saying,” she told her, “that you’re one of those p eople who mix up \ntheir ass and their ashes.” \nFrom that time on they did not speak to each other ag ain. When \ncircumstances demanded it they would send notes. In spite of  the visible hostility \nof the family, Fernanda did not give up her drive to  impose the customs of her \nancestors. She put an end to the custom of eating in the  kitchen and whenever \nanyone was hungry, and she imposed the obligation of do ing it at regular hours at \nthe large table in the dining room, covered with a l inen cloth and with silver \ncandlesticks and table service. The solemnity of an act which  Ú r s u l a  h a d  \nconsidered the most simple one of daily life created a t ense atmosphere against \nwhich the silent José Arcadio Segundo rebelled before a nyone else. But the cus-\ntom was imposed, the same as that of reciting the rosary before dinner, and it \ndrew the attention of the neighbors, who soon spread t he rumor that the \nBuendías did not sit down to the table like other mort als but had changed the act",
            "8": "of eating into a kind of high mass. Even Úrsula’s superst itions, with origins that \ncame more from an inspiration of the moment than from  tradition, came into \nconflict with those of Fernanda, who had inherited the m from her parents and \nkept them defined and catalogued for every occasion. As lon g as Úrsula had full \nuse of her faculties some of the old customs survived and  th e l i fe of th e fam i l y \nkept some quality of her impulsiveness, but when she lost  her sight and the \nweight of her years relegated her to a corner, the circl e of rigidity begun by \nFernanda from the moment she arrived finally closed compl etely and no one but \nshe determined the destiny of the family. The business in pastries and small \ncandy animals that Santa Sofía de la Piedad had kept up  because of Úrsula’s \nwishes was considered an unworthy activity by Fernanda and she lost no time in \nputting a stop to it. The doors of the house, wide ope n from dawn until bedtime, \nwere closed during siesta time under the pretext that the sun heated up the \nbedrooms and in the end they were closed for good. The  aloe branch and loaf of \nbread that had been hanging over the door since the d ays of the founding were \nreplaced by a niche with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Colon el Aureliano, Buendía \nbecame aware somehow of those changes and foresaw their consequences. \n“We’re becoming people of quality,” he protested. “At this rate we’ll end up \nfighting against the Conservative regime again, but t his time to install a king in its \nplace.” Fernanda very tactfully tried not to cross his path . Within herself she was \nbothered by his independent spirit his resistance to all ki nds of social rigidity. She \nwas exasperated by his mugs of coffee at five in the morn ing, the disorder of his \nworkshop, his frayed blanket, and his custom of sitting i n the street door at dusk. \nBut she had to tolerate that one loose piece in the f amily machinery because she \nwas sure that the old colonel was an animal who had bee n tamed by the years \nand by disappointment and who, in a burst of senile reb ellion, was quite capable \nof uprooting the foundations of the house. When her h usband decided to give \ntheir first son the name of his great-grandfather, she  did not dare oppose him",
            "9": "because she had been there only a year. But when the fi rst daughter was born \nshe expressed her unreserved determination to name her R enata after her \nmother. Úrsula had decided to call her Remedios. After a tense argument, in \nwhich Aureliano Segundo acted as the laughing go-bet ween, they baptized her \nwith the name Renata Remedios, but Fernanda went on calling her just Renata \nwhile her husband’s family and everyone in town calle d her Meme, a diminutive \nof Remedios. \nAt first Fernanda did not talk about her family, but i n time she began to \nidealize her father. She spoke of him at the table as an exceptional being who \nhad renounced all forms of vanity and was on his way to b ecoming a saint. \nAureliano Segundo, startled at that unbridled glorif ication of his father-in-law, \ncould not resist the temptation to make small jokes behin d his wife’s back. The \nrest of the family followed his example. Even Úrsula, who was extremely careful \nto preserve family harmony and who suffered in secret fr om the domestic friction, \nonce allowed herself the liberty of saying that her litt le great-great-grandson had \nhis pontifical future assured because he was “the grandson  of a saint and the son \nof a queen and a rustler.” In spite of that conspiracy o f smiles, the children \nbecame accustomed to think of their grandfather as a leg endary being who wrote \nthem pious verses in his letters and every Christmas sent t hem a box of gifts that \nbarely fitted through the outside door. Actually they w ere the last remains of his \nlordly inheritance. They used them to build an altar of  life-size saints in the \nchildren’s bedroom, saints with glass eyes that gave them  a disquietingly lifelike \nlook, whose artistically embroidered clothing was better t han that worn by any \ninhabitant of Macondo. Little by little the funereal splendor of the ancient and icy \nmansion was being transformed into the splendor of the House of Buendía. \n“They’ve already sent us the whole family cemetery,” Aure liano Segundo com-\nmented one day. “All we need now are the weeping wil lows and the tombstones.” \nAlthough nothing ever arrived in the boxes that the children could play with, they",
            "10": "would spend all year waiting for December because, after  a l l ,  t h e  an t i qu e  an d \nalways unpredictable gifts were something, new in the ho use. On the tenth \nChristmas, when little José Arcadio was getting ready to g o to the seminary, the \nenormous box from their grandfather arrived earlier than usual, nailed tight and \nprotected with pitch, and addressed in the usual Gothic letters to the Very \nDistinguished Lady Doña Fernanda del Carpio de Buend ía. While she read the \nletter in her room the children hastened to open the  box. Aided as was customary \nby Aureliano Segundo, they broke the seals, opened the co ver, took out the \nprotective sawdust, and found inside a long lead chest cl osed by copper bolts. \nAureliano Segundo took out the eight bolts as the child ren watched impatiently, \nand he barely had time to give a cry and push the chil dren aside when be raised \nthe lead cover and saw Don Fernando, dressed in black and  with a crucifix on his \nchest, his skin broken out in pestilential sores and cooking slowly in a frothy stew \nwith bubbles like live pearls. \nA short time after the birth of their daughter, the unexpected jubilee for \nColonel Aureliano, Buendía, ordered by the governmen t to celebrate another \nanniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, was announced. It was a decision so out \nof line with official policy that the colonel spoke out v iolently against it and \nrejected the homage. “It’s the first time I’ve ever hea rd of the word ‘jubilee,’ ” he \nsaid. “But whatever it means, it has to be a trick.” The  small goldsmith shop was \nfilled with emissaries. Much older and more solemn, the  lawyers in dark suits who \nin other days had flapped about the colonel like crows h ad returned. When he \nsaw them appear the same as the other time, when they ca me to put a stop to \nthe war, he could not bear the cynicism of their praise . He ordered them to leave \nhim in peace, insisting that he was not a hero of the nation as they said but an \nartisan without memories whose only dream was to die of fatigue in the oblivion \nand misery of his little gold fishes. What made him mo st indignant was the word \nthat the president of the republic himself planned to be present at the ceremonies",
            "11": "in Macondo in order to decorate him with the Order of  Merit. Colonel Aureliano, \nBuendía had him told, word for word, that he was eag erly awaiting that tardy but \ndeserved occasion in order to take a shot at him, not as payment for the arbitrary \nacts and anachronisms of his regime, but for his lack of r espect for an old man \nwho had not done anyone any harm. Such was the vehemence  w i t h  w h i ch  h e \nmade the threat that the president of the republic can celed his trip at the last \nmoment and sent the decoration with a personal represen tative. Colonel Geri-\nneldo Márquez, besieged by pressures of all kinds, left h is bed of a paralytic in \norder to persuade his former companion in arms. When th e latter saw the rocking \nchair carried by four men appear and saw the friend who  had shared his victories \nand defeats since youth sitting in it among some large pi llows, he did not have a \nsingle doubt but that he was making that effort in ord er to express his solidarity. \nBut when he discovered the real motive for his visit he  had them take him out of \nthe workshop. \n“Now I’m convinced too late,” he told him, “that I wou ld have done you a \ngreat favor if I’d let them shoot you.” \nSo the jubilee was celebrated without the attendance o f any members of the \nfamily. Chance had it that it also coincided with carniv al week, but no one could \nget the stubborn idea out of Colonel Aureliano Buend ía’s head that the \ncoincidence had been foreseen by the government in order  t o  h e i g h t e n  t h e  \ncruelty of the mockery. From his lonely workshop he could hea r the martial music, \nthe artillery salutes, the tolling of the Te Deum, and  a few phrases of the \nspeeches delivered in front of the house as they named th e street after him. His \neyes grew moist with indignation, with angry impotence, and for the first time \nsince his defeat it pained him not to have the strength  of youth so that he could \nbegin a bloody war that would wipe out the last vestig es of the Conservative \nregime. The echoes of the homage had not died down w hen Úrsula knocked at \nthe workshop door.",
            "12": "“Don’t bother me,” he said. “I’m busy.” \n“Open up,” Úrsula insisted in a normal voice. “This has n othing to do with the \ncelebration.” \nThen Colonel Aureliano Buendía took down the bar and  saw at the door \nseventeen men of the most varied appearance, of all typ es and colors, but all with \na solitary air that would have been enough to identif y them anywhere on earth. \nThey were his sons. Without any previous agreement, withou t knowing each \nother, they had arrived from the most distant corners of  the coast, captivated by \nthe talk of the jubilee. They all bore with pride the  name Aureliano and the last \nname of their mothers. The three days that they stayed in  the house, to the \nsatisfaction of Úrsula and the scandal of Fernanda, were  like a state war. \nAmaranta searched among old papers for the ledger wher e Úrsula had written \ndown the names and birth and baptism dates of all of them, and beside the space \nfor each one she added his present address. That list coul d well have served as a \nrecapitulation of twenty years of war. From it the noctu rnal itinerary of the colonel \nfrom the dawn he left Macondo at the head of twenty-o ne men on his way to a \nfanciful rebellion until he returned for the last tim e wrapped in a blanket stiff with \nblood could have been reconstructed. Aureliano Segundo d id not let the chance \ngo by to regale his cousins with a thunderous champagne and accordion party \nthat was interpreted as a tardy adjustment of accounts wit h the carnival, which \nwent awry because of the jubilee. They smashed half of the dishes, they \ndestroyed the rose bushes as they chased a bull they were t rying to hog-tie, they \nkilled the hens by shooting them, they made Amaranta da nce the sad waltzes of \nPietro Crespi, they got Remedios the Beauty to put on a  pair of men’s pants and \nclimb a greased pole, and in the dining room they turn ed loose a pig daubed with \nlard, which prostrated Fernanda, but no one regrette d the destruction because \nthe house shook with a healthy earthquake. Colonel Aur eliano Buendía who at \nfirst received them with mistrust and even doubted the parentage of some, was",
            "13": "amused by their wildness, and before they left he gave each one a little gold fish. \nEven the withdrawn José Arcadio Segundo offered them an afternoon of \ncockfights, which was at the point of ending in tragedy b ecause several of the \nAurelianos were so expert in matters of the cockpit that t hey spotted Father \nAntonio Isabel’s tricks at once. Aureliano Segundo, who saw the limitless \nprospect of wild times offered by those mad relatives, de cided that they should all \nstay and work for him. The only one who accepted was Aure liano Triste, a big \nmulatto with the drive and explorer’s spirit of his gr andfather. He had already \ntested his fortune in half the world and it did not m atter to him where he stayed. \nThe others, even though they were unmarried, considered  their destinies \nestablished. They were all skillful craftsmen, the men of  their houses, peace-\nloving people. The Ash Wednesday before they went back t o scatter out along \nthe coast, Amaranta got them to put on Sunday clothes an d accompany her to \nchurch. More amused than devout, they let themselves be  l e d  t o  th e  a l t a r  r a i l  \nwhere Father Antonio Isabel made the sign of the cross in ashes on them. Back \nat the house, when the youngest tried to clean his fore head, he discovered that \nthe mark was indelible and so were those of his brothers.  They tried soap and \nwater, earth and a scrubbing brush, and lastly a pumic e stone and lye, but they \ncould not remove the crosses. On the other hand, Amarant a and the others who \nhad gone to mass took it off without any trouble. “It’s better that way,” Úrsula \nstated as she said goodbye to them. “From now on everyone  will know who you \nare.” They went off in a troop, preceded by a band of musicians and shooting off \nfireworks, and they left behind in the town an impressi on that the Buendía line \nhad enough seed for many centuries. Aureliano Triste, wi th the cross of ashes on \nhis forehead, set up on the edge of town the ice factor y that José Arcadio \nBuendía had dreamed of in his inventive delirium. \nSome months after his arrival, when he was already we ll-known and well-\nliked, Aureliano Triste went about looking for a hous e so that he could send for",
            "14": "his mother and an unmarried sister (who was not the col onel’s daughter), and he \nbecame interested in the run-down big house that looked  abandoned on a corner \nof the square. He asked who owned it. Someone told him  that it did not belong to \nanyone, that in former times a solitary widow who fed o n earth and whitewash \nfrom the walls had lived there, and that in her last years she was seen only twice \non the street with a hat of tiny artificial flowers and  shoes the color of old silver \nwhen she crossed the square to the post office to mail a letter to the Bishop. They \ntold him that her only companion was a pitiless servant w oman who killed dogs \nand cats and any animal that got into the house and thr ew their corpses into the \nmiddle of the street in order to annoy people with th e rotten stench. So much time \nhad passed since the sun had mummified the empty skin of the last animal that \neverybody took it for granted that the lady of the house  an d th e m ai d h ad di ed \nlong before the wars were over, and that if the house  was still standing it was \nbecause in recent years there had not been a rough wint er or destructive wind. \nThe hinges had crumbled with rust, the doors were held up only by clouds of \ncobwebs, the windows were soldered shut by dampness, and t he floor was \nbroken by grass and wildflowers and in the cracks lizards and  a l l  m a n n e r  o f  \nvermin had their nests, all of which seemed to confirm  the notion that there had \nnot been a human being there for at least half a cent ury. The impulsive Aureliano \nTriste did not need such proof to proceed. He pushed on the main door with his \nshoulder and the worm-eaten wooden frame fell down n oiselessly amid a dull \ncataclysm of dust and termite nests. Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold \nwaiting for the dust to clear and then he saw in the ce nter of the room the squalid \nwoman, still dressed in clothing of the past century, with  a few yellow threads on \nher bald head, and with two large eyes, still beautifu l, in which the last stars of \nhope had gone out, and the skin of her face was wrinkled  by the aridity of \nsolitude. Shaken by that vision from another world, Au reliano Triste barely \nnoticed that the woman was aiming an antiquated pistol  at him.",
            "15": "“I beg your pardon,” he murmured. \nShe remained motionless in the center of the room fill ed with knickknacks, \nexamining inch by inch the giant with square shoulder s and with a tattoo of ashes \non his forehead, and through the haze of dust she saw  him in the haze of other \ntimes with a double-barreled shotgun on his shoulder and a string of rabbits in his \nhand. \n“For the love of God,” she said in a low voice, it’s no t right for them to come \nto me with that memory now.” \n“I want to rent the house,” Aureliano Triste said. \nThe woman then raised the pistol, aiming with a firm wrist at the cross of \nashes, and she held the trigger with a determination against which there was no \nappeal. \n“Get out,” she ordered. \nThat night at dinner Aureliano Triste told the famil y about the episode and \nÚrsula wept with consternation. “Holy God!” she exclaimed , clutching her head \nwith her hands. “She’s still alive!” Time, wars, the coun tless everyday disasters \nhad made her forget about Rebeca. The only one who ha d not lost for a single \nminute the awareness that she was alive and rotting in  her wormhole was the \nimplacable and aging Amaranta. She thought of her at  dawn, when the ice of her \nheart awakened her in her solitary bed, and she though t of her when she soaped \nher withered breasts and her lean stomach, and when sh e put on the white stiff-\nstarched petticoats and corsets of old age, and when she c hanged the black \nbandage of terrible expiation on her hand. Always, at  every moment, asleep and \nawake, during the most sublime and most abject moments, Amaranta thought \nabout Rebeca, because solitude had made a selection in h er memory and had \nburned the dimming piles of nostalgic waste that life h ad accumulated in her \nheart, and had purified, magnified and eternalized the others, the most bitter \nones. Remedios the Beauty knew about Rebeca’s existence fr om her. Every time",
            "16": "they passed the run-down house she would tell her about  an unpleasant incident, \na tale of hate, trying in that way to make her extende d rancor be shared by her \nniece and consequently prolonged beyond death, but her plan did not work \nbecause Remedios was immune to any kind of passionate fe elings and much \nless to those of others. Úrsula, on the other hand, who  h a d  su f f e r e d  t h r ou gh  a \nprocess opposite to Amaranta’s, recalled Rebeca with a mem ory free of \nimpurities, for the image of the pitiful child broug ht to the house with the bag \ncontaining her parents’ bones prevailed over the offen se that had made her \nunworthy to be connected to the family tree any longer.  A u r e l i a n o  S e g u n d o  \ndecided that they would have to bring her to the house  and take care of her, but \nhis good intentions were frustrated by the firm intransi gence of Rebeca, who had \nneeded many years of suffering and misery in order to att ain the privileges of \nsolitude and who was not disposed to renounce them in ex change for an old age \ndisturbed by the false attractions of charity. \nIn February, when the sixteen sons of Colonel Aurelia no Buendía returned, \nstill marked with the cross of ashes, Aureliano Triste spoke to them about Rebeca \nin the tumult of the celebration and in half a day th ey restored the appearance of \nthe house, changing doors and windows, painting the f ront with gay colors, \nbracing walls and pouring fresh cement on the floor, bu t they could not get any \nauthorization to continue the work inside. Rebeca did not even come to the door. \nShe let them finish the mad restoration, then calcula ted what it had cost and sent \nArgénida, her old servant who was still with her, to t hem with a handful of coins \nthat had been withdrawn from circulation after the last war and that Rebeca \nthought were still worth something it was then that th ey saw to what a fantastic \npoint her separation from the world had arrived and they understood that it would \nbe impossible to rescue her from her stubborn enclosure w hile she still had a \nbreath of life in her.",
            "17": "On the second visit by the sons of Colonel Aureliano Bu endía to Macondo, \nanother of them, Aureliano Centeno, stayed on to work with Aureliano Triste. He \nwas one of the first who had been brought to the house  for baptism and Úrsula \nand Amaranta remembered him very well because in a few hours he had \ndestroyed every breakable object that passed through his ha nds. Time had \nmoderated his early impulse for growth and he was a m an of average height \nmarked by smallpox scars, but his amazing power for manual destruction \nremained intact. He broke so many plates, even without t ouching them, that \nFernanda decided to buy him a set of pewter ware befor e he did away with the \nlast pieces of her expensive china, and even the resista nt metal plates were soon \ndented and twisted. But to make up for that irremedia ble power, which was \nexasperating even for him, he had a cordiality that wo n the immediate confidence \nof others and a stupendous capacity for work. In a short ti me he had increased \nthe production of ice to such a degree that it was too  much for the local market \nand Aureliano Triste had to think about the possibility of expanding the business \nto other towns in the swamp. It was then that he thoug ht of the decisive step, not \nonly for the modernization of his business but to link t he town with the rest of the \nworld. \n“We have to bring in the railroad,” he said. \nThat was the first time that the word had ever been he ard in Macondo. \nLooking at the sketch that Aureliano Triste drew on the table and that was a direct \ndescendent of the plans with which José Arcadio Buendía had illustrated his \nproject for solar warfare, Úrsula confirmed her impressio n that time was going in \na circle. But unlike his forebear, Aureliano Triste did not lose any sleep or \nappetite nor did he torment anyone with crises of ill h umor, but he considered the \nmost harebrained of projects as immediate possibilities, m ade rational \ncalculations about costs and dates, and brought them off without any \nintermediate exasperation. If Aureliano Segundo had something of his great-",
            "18": "grandfather in him and lacked something of Colonel Aur eliano Buendía, it was an \nabsolute indifference to mockery, and he gave the money t o bring the railroad \nwith the same lighthearted air with which he had giv en it for his brother’s absurd \nnavigation project. Aureliano Triste consulted the calen dar and left the following \nWednesday, planning to return after the rains had passe d. There was no more \nnews of him. Aureliano Centeno, overwhelmed by the a bundance of the factory, \nhad already begun to experiment with the production o f ice with a base of fruit \njuices instead of water, and without knowing it or thi nking about it, he conceived \nthe essential fundamentals for the invention of sherbet . In that way he planned to \ndiversify the production of an enterprise he considered his own, because his \nbrother showed no signs of returning after the rains  had passed and a whole \nsummer had gone by with no news of him. At the start of  a n o t h e r  w i n t e r ,  \nhowever, a woman who was washing clothes in the river d uring the hottest time \nof the day ran screaming down the main street in an ala rming state of commotion. \n“It’s coming,” she finally explained. “Something fright ful, like a kitchen \ndragging a village behind it.” \nAt that moment the town was shaken by a whistle with a fearful echo and a \nloud, panting respiration. During the previous weeks th ey had seen the gangs \nwho were laying ties and tracks and no one paid attentio n to them because they \nthought it was some new trick of the gypsies, coming back wit h whistles and \ntambourines and their age-old and discredited song and dance about the qualities \nof some concoction put together by journeyman geniuses of Jerusalem. But when \nthey recovered from the noise of the whistles and the sn orting, all the inhabitants \nran out into the street and saw Aureliano Triste waving  from the locomotive, and \nin a trance they saw the flower-bedecked train which was arriving for the first time \neight months late. The innocent yellow train that wa s to bring so many \nambiguities and certainties, so many pleasant and unpleasa nt moments, so many \nchanges, calamities, and feelings of nostalgia to Macondo."

The y stayed up all night \nlooking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant tha t Aureliano Triste had \nbrought back when the train made its second trip, and i t took time and effort for \nthem to grow accustomed to its obsessive toom-toom . They be. came indignant \nover the living images that the prosperous merchant B runo Crespi projected in \nthe theater with the lion-head ticket windows, for the  character who had died and \nwas buried in one film and for whose misfortune tears o f affliction had been shed \nwould reappear alive and transformed into an Arab in  t h e  n e x t  o n e .  T h e  \naudience, who paid two cents apiece to share the difficu lties of the actors, would \nnot tolerate that outlandish fraud and they broke up the seats. The mayor, at the \nurging of Bruno Crespi, explained in a proclamation that the cinema was a \nmachine of illusions that did not merit the emotiona l outbursts of the audience. \nWith that discouraging explanation many felt that they had been the victims of \nsome new and showy gypsy business and they decided not to r eturn to the \nmovies, considering that they already had too many troub les of their own to weep \nover the acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings. Some thing similar happened \nwith the cylinder phonographs that the merry matrons fro m France brought with \nthem as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs an d that for a time had \nserious effects on the livelihood of the band of musicia ns. At first curiosity \nincreased the clientele on the forbidden street and the re was even word of \nrespectable ladies who disguised themselves as workers in or der to observe the \nnovelty of the phonograph from first hand, but from so  much and such close \nobservation they soon reached the conclusion that it was not an enchanted mill \nas everyone had thought and as the matrons had said, but  a mechanical trick that \ncould not be compared with something so moving, so human,  and so full of",
            "1": "everyday truth as a band of musicians. It was such a serio us disappointment that \nwhen phonographs became so popular that there was one i n every house they \nwere not considered objects for amusement for adults but  as something good for \nchildren to take apart. On the other hand, when someon e from the town had the \nopportunity to test the crude reality of the telephone  installed in the railroad \nstation, which was thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph \nbecause of its crank, even the most incredulous were upset.  It was as if God had \ndecided to put to the test every capacity for surprise and  was keeping the \ninhabitants of Macondo in a permanent alternation bet ween excitement and \ndisappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extr eme that no one knew for \ncertain where the limits of reality lay. It was an intri cate stew of truths and \nmirages that convulsed the ghost of José Arcadio Buendía un der the chestnut \ntree with impatience and made him wander all through  the house even in broad \ndaylight. Ever since the railroad had been officially in augurated and had begun to \narrive with regularity on Wednesdays at eleven o’clock and  the primitive wooden \nstation with a desk, a telephone, and a ticket window ha d been built, on the \nstreets of Macondo men and women were seen who had adop ted everyday and \nnormal customs and manners but who really looked like pe ople out of a circus. In \na town that had chafed under the tricks of the gypsies there was no future for \nthose ambulatory acrobats of commerce who with equal effr ontery offered a \nwhistling kettle and a daily regime that would assure t he salvation of the soul on \nthe seventh day; but from those who let themselves be con vinced out of fatigue \nand the ones who were always unwary, they reaped stupendo us benefits. Among \nthose theatrical creatures, wearing riding breeches and leggings, a pith helmet \nand steel-rimmed glasses, with topaz eyes and the skin of a thin rooster, there \narrived in Macondo on one of so many Wednesdays the chub by and smiling Mr. \nHerbert, who ate at the house.",
            "2": "No one had noticed him at the table until the first b unch of bananas had \nbeen eaten. Aureliano Segundo had come across him by ch ance as he protested \nIn broken Spanish because there were no rooms at the Ho tel Jacob, and as he \nfrequently did with strangers, he took him home. He was in the captive-balloon \nbusiness, which had taken him halfway around the world with excellent profits, \nbut he had not succeeded in taking anyone up in Macondo because they \nconsidered that invention backward after having seen an d tried the gypsies’ flying \ncarpets. He was leaving, therefore, on the next train. When they brought to the \ntable the tiger-striped bunch of bananas that they wer e accustomed to hang in \nthe dining room during lunch, he picked the first piece  o f  f r u i t  w i t h o u t  g r e a t  \nenthusiasm. But he kept on eating as he spoke, tasting, ch ewing, more with the \ndistraction of a wise man than with the delight of a g ood eater, and when he \nfinished the first bunch he asked them to bring him an other. Then he took a small \ncase with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he  always carried with him. \nWith the auspicious attention of a diamond merchant he  ex amin ed th e ban an a \nmeticulously, dissecting it with a special scalpel, weighin g the pieces on a \npharmacist’s scale, and calculating its breadth with a gun smith’s calipers. Then \nhe took a series of instruments out of the chest with whic h he measured the \ntemperature, the level of humidity in the atmosphere,  and the intensity of the light. \nIt was such an intriguing ceremony that no one could eat  in peace as everybody \nwaited for Mr. Herbert to pass a final and revealing judgment, but he did not say \nanything that allowed anyone to guess his intentions. \nOn the days that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting \nbutterflies on the outskirts of town. On Wednesday a grou p of engineers, \nagronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors arri ved who for several \nweeks explored the places where Mr. Herbert had hunted  his butterflies. Later on \nMr. Jack Brown arrived in an extra coach that had been coupled onto the yellow \ntrain and that was silver-plated all over, with seats of  episcopal velvet, and a roof",
            "3": "of blue glass. Also arriving on the special car, flutteri ng around Mr. Brown, were \nthe solemn lawyers dressed in black who in different times had followed Colonel \nAureliano Buendía everywhere, and that led the peopl e to think that the \nagronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, like  Mr. H erbert with his \ncaptive balloons and his colored butterflies and Mr. Bro wn with his mausoleum on \nwheels and his ferocious German shepherd dogs, had some thing to do with the \nwar. There was not much time to think about it, howev er, because the suspicious \ninhabitants of Macondo barely began to wonder what the  devil was going on \nwhen the town had already become transformed into an e ncampment of wooden \nhouses with zinc roofs inhabited by foreigners who arrive d on the train from \nhalfway around the world, riding not only on the seats and platforms but even on \nthe roof of the coaches. The gringos, who later on bro ught their languid wives in \nmuslin dresses and large veiled hats, built a separate t own across the railroad \ntracks with streets lined with palm trees, houses with scree ned windows, small \nwhite tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ce ilings, and extensive \nblue lawns with peacocks and quails. The section was surround ed by a metal \nfence topped with a band of electrified chicken wire wh ich during the cool \nsummer mornings would be black with roasted swallows. No o ne knew yet what \nthey were after, or whether they were actually nothing but philanthropists, and \nthey had already caused a colossal disturbance, much more t han that of the old \ngypsies, but less transitory and understandable. Endowed wi th means that had \nbeen reserved for Divine Providence in former times, the y changed the pattern of \nthe rams, accelerated the cycle of harvest, and moved the river from where it had \nalways been and put it with its white stones and icy curre nts on the other side of \nthe town, behind the cemetery.

She was becalmed in a magnificent adolescence, m ore and more \nimpenetrable to formality, more and more indifferent  to malice and suspicion, \nhappy in her own world of simple realities. She did no t understand why women \ncomplicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she se wed herself a coarse \ncassock that she simply put over her and without further difficulties resolved the \nproblem of dress, without taking away the feeling of be ing naked, which \naccording to her lights was the only decent way to be whe n at home.

Unaware of t he restless circle in which \nshe moved, of the unbearable state of intimate calamit y that she provoked as she \npassed by, Remedios the Beauty treated the men without t he least bit of malice \nand in the end upset them with her innocent complaisance .

The occasion for the proof \nof it came some months later on one afternoon when Rem edios the Beauty went \nwith a group of girl friends to look at the new plant ings. For the girls of Macondo \nthat novel game was reason for laughter and surprises, frights and jokes, and at \nnight they would talk about their walk as if it had be en an experience in a dream. \nSuch was the prestige of that silence that Úrsula did n ot have the heart to take \nthe fun away from Remedios the Beauty, and she let her  g o  o n e  a f t e r n o o n ,  \nproviding that she wore a hat and a decent dress. As soon  as the group of friends \nwent into the plantings the air became impregnated with a fatal fragrance.

The birth  of the latest José \nArcadio and her unshakable will to bring him up to be  Pope finally caused her to \ncease worrying about her great-granddaughter. She aban doned her to her fate, \ntrusting that sooner or later a miracle would take place  and that in this world of \neverything there would also be a man with enough sloth  to put up with her.

Shut up in his w orkshop, Colonel \nAureliano Buendía thought about those changes and fo r the first time in his quiet \nyears of solitude he was tormented by the definite certai nty that it had been a \nmistake not to have continued the war to its final concl usion.

It was around that \ntime that he was heard to say. “The only difference toda y between Liberals and \nConservatives is that the Liberals go to mass at five o’ clock and the \nConservatives at eight.” Nevertheless he insisted with su ch perseverance, \nbegged in such a way, broke his code of dignity to such a degree, that with a little \nhelp from here and a little more from there, sneakin g about everywhere, with a \nslippery diligence and a pitiless perseverance, he manage d to put together in \neight months more money than Úrsula had buried. Then he visited the ailing \nColonel Gerineldo Márquez so that he would help him start the total war. \nAt a certain time Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was reall y the only one who \ncould have pulled, even from his paralytics chair, the m usty strings of rebellion. \nAfter the armistice of Neerlandia, while Colonel Aure liano Buendía took refuge \nwith his little gold fishes, he kept in touch with th e rebel officers who had been \nfaithful to him until the defeat.

The other war, the bloody one of twenty years, did not \ncause them as much damage as the corrosive war of eternal  postponements. \nEven Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, who escaped three att empts on his life, \nsurvived five wounds, and emerged unscathed from innume rable battles, \nsuccumbed to that atrocious siege of waiting and sank int o the miserable defeat \nof old age, thinking of Amaranta among the diamond- shaped patches of light in a \nborrowed house.

Meme , his sister, dividing her \ntime between Fernanda’s rigidity and Amaranta’s bitte rness, at almost the same \nmoment reached the age set for her to be sent to the n uns’ school, where they \nwould make a virtuoso on the clavichord of her. Úrsula  felt tormented by grave \ndoubts concerning the effectiveness of the methods with w hich she had molded \nthe spirit of the languid apprentice Supreme Pontiff,  but she did not put the blame \non her staggering old age or the dark clouds that barel y permitted her to make \nout the shape of things, but on something that she he rself could not really define \nand that she conceived confusedly as a progressive breakdow n of time. “The \nyears nowadays don’t pass the way the old ones used to,” she would say, feeling \nthat everyday reality was slipping through her hands. In the past, she thought, \nchildren took a long time to grow up. All one had to do was remember all the time \nneeded for José Arcadio, the elder, to go away with the  gypsies and all that \nhappened before he came back painted like a snake and ta lking like an \nastronomer, and the things that happened in the house before Amaranta and \nArcadio forgot the language of the Indians and learne d Spanish. One had to see \nonly the days of sun and dew that poor José Arcadio Buendí a went through under \nthe chestnut tree and all the time weeded to mourn h is death before they brought \nin a dying Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who after so m uch war and so much \nsuffering from it was still not fifty years of age. In ot her times, after spending the \nwhole day making candy animals, she had more than enough  t i m e  f o r  t h e  \nchildren, to see from the whites of their eyes that they needed a dose of castor \noil. Now, however, when she had nothing to do and w ould go about with José",
            "1": "Arcadio riding on her hip from dawn to dusk, this bad ki nd of time compelled her \nto leave things half done. The truth was that Úrsula r esisted growing old even \nwhen she had already lost count of her age and she was a bother on all sides as \nshe tried to meddle in everything and as she annoyed stra ngers with her \nquestions as to whether they had left a plaster Saint Jo seph to be kept until the \nrains were over during the days of the war. No one k new exactly when she had \nbegun to lose her sight. Even in her later years, when  she could no longer get out \nof bed, it seemed that she was simply defeated by decrep itude, but no one \ndiscovered that she was blind. She had noticed it before  the birth of José Arcadio. \nAt first she thought it was a matter of a passing debili ty and she secretly took \nmarrow syrup and put honey on her eyes, but quite soon sh e began to realize \nthat she was irrevocably sinking into the darkness, to a point where she never \nhad a clear notion of the invention of the electric l ight, for when they put in the \nfirst bulbs she was only able to perceive the glow. She did not tell anyone about it \nbecause it would have been a public recognition of her  uselessness. She \nconcentrated on a silent schooling in the distances of thi ngs and peoples voices, \nso that she would still be able to see with her memory what the shadows of her \ncataracts no longer allowed her to. Later on she was to  discover the unforeseen \nhelp of odors, which were defined in the shadows with a  strength that was much \nmore convincing than that of bulk and color, and which sa ved her finally from the \nshame of admitting defeat. In the darkness of the room she was able to thread a \nneedle and sew a buttonhole and she knew when the mi lk was about to boil. She \nknew with so much certainty the location of everything tha t she herself forgot that \nshe was blind at times. On one occasion Fernanda had the  whole house upset \nbecause she had lost her wedding ring, and Úrsula fou nd it on a shelf in the \nchildren’s bedroom. Quite simply, while the others were  going carelessly all \nabout, she watched them with her four senses so that the y never took her by \nsurprise, and after some time she discovered that every member of the family,",

Only wh en they deviated from \nmeticulous routine did they run the risk of losing some thing. So when she heard \nFernanda all upset be cause she had lost her ring, Úrs ula remembered that the \nonly thing different that she had done that day was to put the mattresses out in \nthe sun because Meme had found a bedbug the might be fore. Since the children \nhad been present at the fumigation, Úrsula figured th at Fernanda had put the ring \nin the only place where they could not reach it: the shel f. Fernanda, on the other \nhand, looked for it in vain along the paths of her eve ryday itinerary without \nknowing that the search for lost things is hindered by ro utine habits and that is \nwhy it is so difficult to find them. \nThe rearing of José Arcadio helped Úrsula in the exhaust ing task of keeping \nherself up to date on the smallest changes in the house. When she realized that \nAmaranta was dressing the saints in the bedroom she pret ended to show the boy \nthe differences in the colors. \n“Let’s see,” she would tell him. “Tell me what color th e Archangel Raphael is \nwearing.” \nIn that way the child gave her the information that wa s denied her by her \neyes, and long before he went away to the seminary Úrsula  could already \ndistinguish the different colors of the saints’ clothing  by th e tex tu re. S ometi m es \nunforeseen accidents would happen. One afternoon when Amaranta was \n‘embroidering on the porch with the begonias Úrsula bumped into her. \n“For heaven’s sake,” Amaranta protested. “watch where you ’re going.” \n“It’s your fault,” Úrsula said. “You’re not sitting wher e you’re supposed to.” \nShe was sure of it. But that day she began to realize so mething that no one \nhad noticed and it was that with the passage of the yea r the sun imperceptibly \nchanged position and those who sat on the porch had t o change their position \nlittle by little without being aware of it. From the n on Úrsula had only to remember",

Even though the \ntrembling of her hands was more and more noticeable an d the weight of her feet \nwas too much for her, her small figure was never seen i n so many places at the \nsame time. She was almost as diligent as when she had th e whole weight of the \nhouse on her shoulders. Nevertheless, in the impenetrab le solitude of \ndecrepitude she had such clairvoyance as she examined th e most insignificant \nhappenings in the family that for the first time she saw  clearly the truths that her \nbusy life in former times had prevented her from seeing.  A r o u n d  th e  t i m e  t h e y \nwere preparing José Arcadio for the seminary she had alre ady made a detailed \nrecapitulation of life in the house since the founding of Macondo and had \ncompletely changed the opinion that she had always held of her descendants. \nShe realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not  lost his love for the family \nbecause he had been hardened by the war, as she had tho ught before, but that \nhe had never loved anyone, not even his wife Remedio s or the countless one-\nnight women who had passed through his life, and much less his sons. She \nsensed that he had fought so many wars not out of ideali sm, as everyone had \nthought, nor had he renounced a certain victory because of  fatigue, as everyone \nhad thought, but that he had won and lost for the sam e reason, pure and sinful \npride. She reached the conclusion that the son for who m she would have given \nher life was simply a man incapable of love. One night when she was carrying \nhim in her belly she heard him weeping. It was such a definite lament that José \nArcadio Buendía woke up beside her and was happy with th e idea that his son \nwas going to be a ventriloquist. Other people predicte d that he would be a \nprophet. She, on the other hand, shuddered from the certainty that the deep \nmoan was a first indication of the fearful pig tail an d she begged God to let the \nchild die in her womb. But the lucidity of her old ag e allowed her to see, and she \nsaid so many times, that the cries of children in their mo thers’ wombs are not \nannouncements of ventriloquism or a faculty for prophecy but an unmistakable",
            "4": "sign of an incapacity for love. The lowering of the ima ge of her son brought out in \nher all at once all the compassion that she owed him. A maranta, however, whose \nhardness of heart frightened her, whose concentrated bit terness made her bitter, \nsuddenly became clear to her in the final analysis as the most tender woman who \nhad ever existed, and she understood with pitying clari ty that the unjust tortures \nto which she had submitted Pietro Crespi had not been  dictated by a desire for \nvengeance, as everyone had thought, nor had the slow m artyrdom with which \nshe had frustrated the life of Colonel Gerineldo Márq uez been determined by the \ngall of her bitterness, as everyone had thought, but tha t both actions had been a \nmortal struggle between a measureless love and an invin cible cowardice, and \nthat the irrational fear that Amaranta had always had  of her own tormented heart \nhad triumphed in the end. It was during that time th at Úrsula, began to speak \nRebeca’s name, bringing back the memory of her with an old love that was \nexalted by tardy repentance and a sudden admiration, co ming to understand that \nonly she, Rebeca, the one who had never fed of her mil k but only of the earth of \nthe land and the whiteness of the walls, the one who d id not carry the blood of \nher veins in hers but the unknown blood of the strange rs whose bones were still \nclosing in their grave. Rebeca, the one with an impatien t heart, the one with a \nfierce womb, was the only one who bad the unbridled cou rage that Úrsula had \nwanted for her line. \n“Rebeca,” she would say, feeling along the walls, “how u nfair we’ve been to \nyou!” \nIn the house they simply thought that her mind was wande ring, especially \nsince the time she had begun walking about with her r ight arm raised like the \nArchangel Gabriel. Fernanda, however, realized that there was a sun of \nclairvoyance in the shadows of that wandering, for Úrsul a could say without \nhesitation how much money had been spent in the house during the previous \nyear.

Al so almost a hundred years \nold, but fit and agile in spite of her inconceivable f atness, which frightened chil-\ndren as her laughter had frightened the doves in oth er times, Pilar Ternera was \nnot surprised that Úrsula was correct because her own expe rience was beginning \nto tell her that an alert old age can be more keen th an the cards. \nNevertheless, when Úrsula realized that she had not h ad enough time to \nconsolidate the vocation of José Arcadio, she let herself b e disturbed by \nconsternation. She began to make mistakes, trying to see wi th her eyes the \nthings that intuition allowed her to see with greate r clarity. One morning she \npoured the contents of an inkwell over the boy’s head t hinking that it was rose \nwater. She stumbled so much in her insistence in taking part in everything that \nshe felt herself upset by gusts of bad humor and she trie d to get rid of the \nshadows that were beginning to wrap her in a straitjacke t of cobwebs. It was then \nthat it occurred to her that her clumsiness was not the fi rst victory of decrepitude \nand darkness but a sentence passed by time. She thought t hat previously, when \nGod did not make the same traps out of the months and ye ars that the Turks \nused when they measured a yard of percale, things were d ifferent. Now children \nnot only grew faster, but even feelings developed in a  different way. No sooner \nhad Remedios the Beauty ascended to heaven in body and so ul than the \ninconsiderate Fernanda was going about mumbling to her self because her sheets \nhad been carried off. The bodies of the Aurelianos wer e no sooner cold in their \ngraves than Aureliano Segundo had the house lighted u p again, filled with \ndrunkards playing the accordion and dousing themselves in champagne, as if \ndogs and not Christians had died, and as if that madhou se which had cost her so \nmany headaches and so many candy animals was destined to beco me a trash",

Remembering those things as she pr epared José Arcadio’s \ntrunk, Úrsula wondered if it was not preferable to li e down once and for all in her \ngrave and let them throw the earth over her, and she  asked God, without fear, if \nhe really believed that people were made of iron in order to bear so many \ntroubles and mortifications, and asking over and over s he was stirring up her own \nconfusion and she felt irrepressible desires to let herself  go and scamper about \nlike a foreigner and allow herself at last an instant o f rebellion, that instant \nyearned for so many times and so many times postponed, put ting her resignation \naside and shitting on everything once and for all and drawing out of her heart the \ninfinite stacks of bad words that she had been forced to sw allow over a century of \nconformity. \n“Shit!” she shouted. \nAmaranta, who was starting to put the clothes into the trunk, thought that she \nhad been bitten by a scorpion. \n“Where is it?” she asked in alarm. \n“What?” \n“The bug!” Amaranta said. \nÚrsula put a finger on her heart. \n“Here,” she said. \nOn Thursday, at two in the afternoon, José Arcadio left for the seminary. \n‘Úrsula would remember him always as she said good-bye t o him, languid and \nserious, without shedding a tear, as she had taught hi m, sweltering in the heat in \nthe green corduroy suit with copper buttons and a starche d bow around his neck. \nHe left the dining room impregnated with the penetr ating fragrance of rose water \nthat she had sprinkled on his head so that she could fo llow his tracks through the \nhouse.

The only one who refused to ta ke part in the farewell was \nColonel Aureliano Buendía. \n“That’s all we need,” he muttered. “A Pope!” \nThree months later Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda to ok Meme to school \nand came back with a clavichord, which took the place of  the pianola. It was \naround that time that Amaranta started sewing her own  shroud. The banana fever \nhad calmed down. The old inhabitants of Macondo found themselves surrounded \nby newcomers and working hard to cling to their precariou s resources of times \ngone by, but comforted in any case by the sense that they h ad survived a \nshipwreck. In the house they still had guests for lunch and  the old routine was \nnever really set up again until the banana company left  years later. Nevertheless, \nthere were radical changes in the traditional sense of hospitality because at that \ntime it was Fernanda who imposed her rules. With Úrsula  r e l e g a t e d  t o  t h e  \nshadows and with Amaranta absorbed In the work of her w inding cloth, the \nformer apprentice queen had the freedom to choose the guests and impose on \nthem the rigid norms that her parents had taught her.  Her severity made the \nhouse a redoubt of old customs in a town convulsed by the  vulgarity with which \nthe outsiders squandered their easy fortunes. For her, wi th no further questions \nasked, proper people were those who had nothing to do with the banana \ncompany. Even José Arcadio Segundo, her brother-in-law, was the victim of her \ndiscriminatory jealousy because during the excitement of t he first days he gave \nup his stupendous fighting cocks again and took a job as for eman with the \nbanana company. \n“He won’t ever come into this house again,” Fernanda sa id, “as long as he \ncarries the rash of the foreigners.” \nSuch was the narrowness imposed in the house that Aurel iano Segundo felt \nmore comfortable at Petra Cotes’s. First, with the pre text of taking the burden off",
            "8": "his wife, he transferred his parties. Then, with the pr etext that the animals were \nlosing their fertility, he transferred his barns and stab les. Finally, with the pretext \nthat it was cooler in his concubine’s house, he transferre d the small office in \nwhich he handled his business. When Fernanda realized that she was a widow \nwhose husband had still not died, it was already too lat e for things to return to \ntheir former state. Aureliano Segundo barely ate at h ome and the only \nappearances he put in, such as to sleep with his wife, we re not enough to \nconvince anyone. One night, out of carelessness, morning f ound him in Petra \nCotes’s bed. Fernanda, contrary to expectations, did not reproach him in the least \nor give the slightest sigh of resentment, but on the sa me day she sent two trunks \nwith his clothing to the house of his concubine. She se nt them in broad daylight \nand with instructions that they be carried through the m iddle of the street so that \neveryone could see them, thinking that her straying husba nd would be unable to \nbear the shame and would return to the fold with hi s head hung low. But that \nheroic gesture was just one more proof of how poorly Fer nanda knew not only the \ncharacter of her husband but the character of a communit y that had nothing to do \nwith that of her parents, for everyone who saw the tru nks pass by said that it was \nthe natural culmination of a story whose intimacies were  known to everyone, and \nAureliano Segundo celebrated the freedom he had recei ved with a party that \nlasted for three days.

Inspired by the things he had seen on his furtive visits to the French \nmatrons, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a bed w ith an archiepiscopal \ncanopy, put velvet curtains on the windows, and covered the ceiling and the walls \nof the bedroom with large rock-crystal mirrors. At the sam e time he was more of a \ncarouser and spendthrift than ever. On the train, whic h arrived every day at \neleven o’clock, he would receive cases and more cases of cham pagne and \nbrandy. On the way back from the station he would drag t he improvised \ncumbiamba  along in full view of all the people on the way, na tives or outsiders, \nacquaintances or people yet to be known, without distin ctions of any kind. Even \nthe slippery Mr. Brown, who talked only in a strange ton gue, let himself be \nseduced by the tempting signs that Aureliano Segundo mad e him and several \ntimes he got dead drunk in Petra Cotes’s house and he ev en made the fierce \nGerman shepherd dogs that went everywhere with him da nce to some Texas \nsongs that he himself mumbled in one way or another t o the accompaniment of \nthe accordion. \n“Cease, cows,” Aureliano Segundo shouted at the height  of the party. \n“Cease, because life is short.” \nHe never looked better, nor had he been loved more, n or had the breeding \nof his animals been wilder. There was a slaughtering of  so many cows, pigs, and \nchickens for the endless parties that the ground in the cou rtyard turned black and \nmuddy with so much blood. It was an eternal execution ground of bones and \ninnards, a mud pit of leftovers, and they had to keep e xploding dynamite bombs \nall the time so that the buzzards would not pluck out the  guests’ eyes. Aureliano \nSegundo grew fat, purple-colored, turtle-shaped, becau se of an appetite \ncomparable only to that of José Arcadio when he came back f rom traveling",
            "10": "around the world. The prestige of his outlandish vora city, of his immense capacity \nas a spendthrift, of his unprecedented hospitality went b eyond the borders of the \nswamp and attracted the best-qualified gluttons from a ll along the coast. \nFabulous eaters arrived from everywhere to take part in  the irrational tourneys of \ncapacity and resistance that were organized in the house o f Petra Cotes. \nAureliano Segundo was the unconquered eater until the  luckless Saturday when \nCamila Sagastume appeared, a totemic female known all  through the land by the \ngood name of “The Elephant.” The duel lasted until d awn on Tuesday. During the \nfirst twenty-four hours, having dispatched a dinner of veal, with cassava, yams, \nand fried bananas, and a case and a half of champagne in addition, Aureliano \nSegundo was sure of victory. He seemed more enthusiastic, m ore vital than his \nimperturbable adversary, who possessed a style that was obvi ously more profes-\nsional, but at the same time less emotional for the lar ge crowd that filled the \nhouse. While Aureliano Segundo ate with great bites, overcome by the anxiety of \nvictory, The Elephant was slicing her meat with the ar t of a surgeon and eating it \nunhurriedly and even with a certain pleasure. She was gigantic and sturdy, but \nover her colossal form a tenderness of femininity prevail ed and she had a face \nthat was so beautiful, hands so fine and well cared for,  and such an irresistible \npersonal charm that when Aureliano Segundo saw her en ter the house he \ncommented in a low voice that he would have preferred to have the tourney in \nbed and not at the table. Later on, when he saw her consume a side of veal \nwithout breaking a single rule of good table manners, he commented seriously \nthat that delicate, fascinating, and insatiable proboscid ian was in a certain way \nthe ideal woman. He was not mistaken. The reputation o f a bone crusher that had \npreceded The Elephant had no basis. She was not a beef cruncher or a bearded \nlady from a Greek circus, as had been said, but the directo r of a school of voice. \nShe had learned to eat when she was already the respect able mother of a family, \nlooking for a way for her children to eat better and not by means of any artificial",
            "11": "stimulation of their appetites but through the absolut e tranquility of their spirits. \nHer theory, demonstrated in practice, was based on the pr inciple that a person \nwho had all matters of conscience in perfect shape should be able to eat until \novercome by fatigue. And it was for moral reasons and spo rting interest that she \nleft her school and her home to compete with a man who se fame as a great, \nunprincipled eater had spread throughout the country. From the first moment she \nsaw him she saw that Aureliano Segundo would lose not  his stomach but his \ncharacter. At the end of the first night, while The El ephant was boldly going on, \nAureliano Segundo was wearing himself out with a grea t deal of talking and \nlaughing. They slept four hours. On awakening each one  had the juice of forty \noranges, eight quarts of coffee, and thirty raw eggs. On  the second morning, after \nmany hours without sleep and having put away two pigs, a  bunch of bananas, \nand four cases of champagne, The Elephant suspected that  Au reli an o S egun do \nhad unknowingly discovered the same method as hers, but by the absurd route of \ntotal irresponsibility. He was, therefore, more danger ous than she had thought. \nNevertheless, when Petra Cotes brought two roast turkeys t o the table, Aureliano \nSegundo was a step away from being stuffed. \n“If you can’t, don’t eat any more,” The Elephant said t o him. “Let’s call it a \ntie.” \nShe said it from her heart, understanding that she coul d not eat another \nmouthful either, out of remorse for bringing on the death of her adversary. But \nAureliano Segundo interpreted it as another challeng e and he filled himself with \nturkey beyond his incredible capacity. He lost consciousness. He fell face down \ninto the plate filled with bones, frothing at the mo uth like a dog, and drowning in \nmoans of agony. He felt, in the midst of the darkness, th at they were throwing him \nfrom the top of a tower into a bottomless pit and in a last flash of consciousness \nhe realized that at the end of that endless fall deat h was waiting for him. \n“Take me to Fernanda,” he managed to say.",

He did recover, indeed, in  less than a week, and two \nweeks later he was celebrating the fact of his survival wi th unprecedented \nfestivities. He continued living at Petra Cotes’s but h e would visit Fernanda every \nday and sometimes he would stay to eat with the family, a s if fate had reversed \nthe situation and had made him the husband of his concu bine and the lover of his \nwife. \nIt was a rest for Fernanda. During the boredom of her  abandonment her only \ndistractions were the clavichord lessons at siesta time and  the letters from her \nchildren. In the detailed messages that she sent them e very two weeks there was \nnot a single line of truth. She hid her troubles from  them. She hid from them the \nsadness of a house which, in spite of the light on th e begonias, in spite of the \nheaviness at two in the afternoon, in spite of the freq uent waves of festivals that \ncame in from the street was more and more like the colo nial mansion of her \nparents.

The watch ful Úrsula realized what \nher son was doing but she could not stop him. \n“You have a heart of stone,” she told him. \n“It’s not a question of a heart,” he said. “The room’s getting full of moths.” \nAmaranta was weaving her shroud. Fernanda did not und erstand why she \nwould write occasional letters to Meme and even send her  gifts and on the other \nhand did not even want to hear about José Arcadio. “Th ey’ll die without knowing \nwhy,” Amaranta answered when she was asked through Úrsul a, and that answer \nplanted an enigma in Fernanda’s heart that she was ne ver able to clarify. Tall, \nbroad-shouldered, proud, always dressed in abundant pett icoats with the lace \nand in air of distinction that resisted the years and bad  memories, Amaranta \nseemed to carry the cross of ashes of virginity on her foreh ead. In reality she \ncarried it on her hand in the black bandage, which she  did not take off even to \nsleep and which she washed and ironed herself. Her lif e was spent in weaving \nher shroud. It might have been said that she wove du ring the day and unwove \nduring the night, and not with any hope of defeating  solitude in that way, but, \nquite the contrary, in order to nurture it. \nThe greatest worry that Fernanda had during her years o f abandonment was \nthat Meme would come to spend her first vacation and not  f i n d  A u r e l i a n o  \nSegundo at home. His congestion had put an end to tha t fear. When Meme \nreturned, her parents had made an agreement that not  only would the girl think \nthat Aureliano Segundo was still a domesticated husband  but also that she would \nnot notice the sadness of the house. Every year for two mon ths Aureliano \nSegundo played his role of an exemplary husband and he organized parties with \nice cream and cookies which the gay and lively schoolgirl e nhanced with the \nclavichord. It was obvious from then on that she had in herited very little of her \nmother’s character. She seemed more of a second version o f Amaranta when the \nlatter had not known bitterness and was arousing the h ouse with her dance steps",
            "14": "at the age of twelve or fourteen before her secret pa ssion for Pietro Crespi was to \ntwist the direction of her heart in the end. But unli ke Amaranta, unlike all of them, \nMeme still did not reveal the solitary fate of the fam ily and she seemed entirely in \nconformity with the world, even when she would shut h erself up in the parlor at \ntwo in the afternoon to practice the clavichord with an  inflexible discipline. It was \nobvious that she liked the house, that she spent the who le year dreaming about \nthe excitement of the young people her arrival brough t around, and that she was \nnot far removed from the festive vocation and hospitabl e excesses of her father. \nThe first sign of that calamitous inheritance was reveale d on her third vacation, \nwhen Meme appeared at the house with four nuns and si xty-eight classmates \nwhom she had invited to spend a week with her family o n her own Initiative and \nwithout any previous warning. \n“How awful!” Fernanda lamented. “This child is as much  of a barbarian as \nher father!” \nIt was necessary to borrow beds and hammocks from the neighb ors, to set \nup nine shifts at the table, to fix hours for bathin g, and to borrow forty stools so \nthat the girls in blue uniforms with masculine buttons would not spend the whole \nday running from one place to another. The visit was a  failure because the noisy \nschoolgirls would scarcely finish breakfast before they had t o start taking turns for \nlunch and then for dinner, and for the whole week th ey were able to take only one \nwalk through the plantations. At nightfall the nuns we re exhausted, unable to \nmove, give another order, and still the troop of tir eless adolescents was in the \ncourtyard singing school songs out of tune. One day they we re on the point of \ntrampling Úrsula, who made an effort to be useful pr ecisely where she was most \nin the way. On another day the nuns got all excited beca use Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía had urinated under the chestnut tree without  being concerned that the \nschoolgirls were in the courtyard. Amaranta was on the po int of causing panic \nbecause one of the nuns went into the kitchen as she w as salting the soup and",
            "15": "the only thing that occurred to her to say was to ask what  those handfuls of white \npowder were. \n“Arsenic,” Amaranta answered. \nThe night of their arrival the students carried on in such a way, trying to go to \nthe bathroom before they went to bed, that at one o’ clock in the morning the last \nones were still going in. Fernanda then bought sevent y-two chamberpots but she \nonly managed to change the nocturnal problem into a mo rning one, because from \ndawn on there was a long line of girls, each with her  pot in her hand, waiting for \nher turn to wash it. Although some of them suffered f evers and several of them \nwere infected by mosquito bites, most of them showed an unbreakable resistance \nas they faced the most troublesome difficulties, and even  a t  t h e  t i m e  o f  t h e  \ngreatest heat they would scamper through the garden. Wh en they finally left, the \nflowers were destroyed, the furniture broken, and the w alls covered with drawings \nand writing, but Fernanda pardoned them for all of the damage because of her \nrelief at their leaving. She returned the borrowed b eds and stools and kept the \nseventy-two chamberpots in Melquíades’ room. The locked ro om, about which \nthe spiritual life of the house revolved in former tim es, was known from that time \non as the “chamberpot room.” For Colonel Aureliano B uendía it was the most \nappropriate name, because while the rest of the family was still amazed by the \nfact that Melquíades’ room was immune to dust and destru ction, he saw it turned \ninto a dunghill. In any case, it did not seem to bothe r him who was correct, and if \nhe found out about the fate of the room it was becaus e Fernanda kept passing by \nand disturbing his work for a whole afternoon as she put  away the chamberpots. \nDuring those days José Arcadio Segundo reappeared in the  house. He went \nalong the porch without greeting anyone and he shut himself up in the workshop \nto talk to the colonel. In spite of the fact that she cou ld not see him, Úrsula \nanalyzed the clicking of his foreman’s boots and was surpr ised at the \nunbridgeable distance that separated him from the fami ly, even from the twin",
            "16": "brother with whom he had played ingenious games of co nfusion in childhood and \nwith whom he no longer had any traits in common. He wa s linear, solemn, and \nhad a pensive air and the sadness of a Saracen and a mo urnful glow on his face \nthat was the color of autumn. He was the one who most r esembled his mother, \nSanta Sofía de la Piedad. Úrsula reproached herself for the habit of forgetting \nabout him when she spoke about the family, but when sh e sensed him in the \nhouse again and noticed that the colonel let him into the workshop during working \nhours, she reexamined her old memories and confirmed th e belief that at some \nmoment in childhood he had changed places with his twin  brother, because it was \nhe and not the other one who should have been called  Aureliano. No one knew \nthe details of his life. At one time it was discovered t hat he had no fixed abode, \nthat he raised fighting cocks at Pilar Ternera’s house and  that sometimes he \nwould stay there to sleep but that he almost always spent the night in the rooms \nof the French matrons. He drifted about, with no tie s of affection, with no \nambitions, like a wandering star in Úrsula’s planetary syst em. \nIn reality, José Arcadio Segundo was not a member of the  family, nor would \nhe ever be of any other since that distant dawn when C olonel Gerineldo Márquez \ntook him to the barracks, not so that he could see an exec ution, but so that for the \nrest of his life he would never forget the sad and som ewhat mocking smile of the \nman being shot. That was not only his oldest memory, bu t the only one he had of \nhis childhood. The other one, that of an old man wit h an old-fashioned vest and a \nhat with a brim like a crow’s wings who told him marvel ous things framed in a \ndazzling window, he was unable to place in any period. I t was an uncertain \nmemory, entirely devoid of lessons or nostalgia, the opp osite of the memory of \nthe executed man, which had really set the direction o f his life and would return to \nhis memory clearer and dearer as he grew older, as if th e passage of time were \nbringing him closer to it. Úrsula tried to use José Arcadi o Segundo to get Colonel \nAureliano Buendía. to give up his imprisonment. “Get him to go to the movies,”",
            "17": "she said to him. “Even if he doesn’t like the picture,  as least he’ll breathe a little \nfresh air.” But it did not take her long to realize t hat he was as insensible to her \nbegging as the colonel would have been, and that the y were armored by the \nsame impermeability of affection. Although she never k new, nor did anyone \nknow, what they spoke about in their prolonged sessions shut  u p  i n  t h e  \nworkshop, she understood that they were probably the only members of the \nfamily who seemed drawn together by some affinity. \nThe truth is that not even José Arcadio Segundo would h ave been able to \ndraw the colonel out of his confinement. The invasion o f schoolgirls had lowered \nthe limits of his patience. With the pretext that his w edding bedroom was at the \nmercy of the moths in spite of the destruction of Remedio s’ appetizing dolls, he \nhung a hammock in the workshop and then he would leave it only to go into the \ncourtyard to take care of his necessities. Úrsula was unable to string together \neven a trivial conversation with him. She knew that h e did not look at the dishes \nof food but would put them at one end of his workbenc h while he finished a little \nfish and it did not matter to him if the soup curdled  or if the meat got cold. He \ngrew harder and harder ever since Colonel Gerineldo M árquez refused to back \nhim up in a senile war. He locked himself up inside hi mself and the family finally \nthought of him is if he were dead. No other human re action was seen in him until \none October eleventh, when he went to the. street doo r to watch a circus parade. \nFor Colonel Aureliano Buendía it had been a day just like all those of his last \nyears. At five o’clock in the morning the noise of the t oads and crickets outside \nthe wall woke him up. The drizzle had persisted since Sa turday and there was no \nnecessity for him to hear their tiny whispering among th e leaves of the garden \nbecause he would have felt the cold in his bones in any  case. He was, as always, \nwrapped in his woolen blanket and wearing his crude cott on long drawers, which \nhe still wore for comfort, even though because of their musty, old-fashioned style \nhe called them his “Goth drawers.” He put on his tight pants but did not button",
            "18": "them up, nor did he put the gold button into his shi rt collar as he always did, \nbecause he planned to take a bath. Then he put the bl anket over his head like a \ncowl. brushed his dripping mustache with his fingers, and went to urinate in the \ncourtyard. There was still so much time left for the sun to come out that José \nArcadio Buendía was still dozing under the shelter of p alm fronds that had been \nrotted by the rain. He did not see him, as he had never  seen him, nor did he hear \nthe incomprehensible phrase that the ghost of his fathe r addressed to him as he \nawakened, startled by the stream of hot urine that splat tered his shoes. He put \nthe bath off for later, not because of the cold and th e dampness, but because of \nthe oppressive October mist. On his way back to the workshop he noticed the \nodor of the wick that Santa Sofía de la Piedad was usin g to light the stoves, and \nhe waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil so th at he could take along his mug \nwithout sugar. Santa Sofía de la Piedad asked him, as o n every morning, what \nday of the week it was, and he answered that it was Tuesd ay, October eleventh. \nWatching the glow of the fire as it gilded the persiste nt woman who neither then \nnor in any instant of her life seemed to exist complete ly, he suddenly \nremembered that on one October eleventh in the middl e of the war he had \nawakened with the brutal certainty that the woman with  whom he had slept was \ndead. She really was and he could not forget the date because she had asked \nhim an hour before what day it was. In spite of the me mory he did not have an \nawareness this time either of to what degree his omens h ad abandoned him and \nwhile the coffee was boiling he kept on thinking out of  pure curiosity but without \nthe slightest risk of nostalgia about the woman whose nam e he had never known \nand whose face he had not seen because she had stumbled to his hammock in \nthe dark. Nevertheless, in the emptiness of so many women who came into his \nlife in the same way, he did not remember that she wa s the one who in the \ndelirium of that first meeting was on the point of fo undering in her own tears and \nscarcely an hour before her death had sworn to love him u ntil she died. He did",
            "19": "not think about her again or about any of the others a fter he went into the \nworkshop with the steaming cup, and he lighted the lam p in order to count the \nlittle gold fishes, which he kept in a tin pail. Ther e  were seventeen of them. Since \nhe had decided not to sell any, he kept on making two fi shes a day and when he \nfinished twenty-five he would melt them down and start  all over again. He worked \nall morning, absorbed, without thinking about anythin g, without realizing that at \nten o’clock the rain had grown stronger and someone ran  past the workshop \nshouting to close the doors before the house was flooded,  and without thinking \neven about himself until Úrsula came in with his lunch  and turned out the light. \n“What a rain!” Úrsula said. \n“October,” he said. \nWhen he said it he did not raise his eyes from the first little fish of the day \nbecause he was putting in the rubies for the eyes. Only when he finished it and \nput it with the others in the pail did he begin to d rink the soup. Then, very slowly, \nhe ate the piece of meat roasted with onions, the whit e rice, and the slices of fried \nbananas all on the same plate together. His appetite did not change under either \nthe best or the harshest of circumstances. After lunch he felt the drowsiness of \ninactivity. Because of a kind of scientific superstition he  never worked, or read, or \nbathed, or made love until two hours of digestion had  gone by, and it was such a \ndeep-rooted belief that several times he held up milit ary operations so as not to \nsubmit the troops to the risks of indigestion. So he lay d own in the hammock, \nremoving the wax from his ears with a penknife, and in  a few minutes he was \nasleep. He dreamed that he was going into an empty hou se with white walls and \nthat he was upset by the burden of being the first huma n being to enter it. In the \ndream he remembered that he had dreamed the same th ing the night before and \non many nights over the past years and he knew that the image would be erased \nfrom his memory when he awakened because that recurrent d ream had the \nquality of not being remembered except within the dre am itself. A moment later,",
            "20": "indeed, when the barber knocked at the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía awoke with the impression that he had fallen a sleep involuntarily for a \nfew seconds and that he had not had time to dream anyth ing. \n“Not today.” he told the barber. “We’ll make it on Fr iday.” \nHe had a three-day beard speckled with white hairs, but he did not think it \nnecessary to shave because on Friday he was going to have hi s hair cut and it \ncould all be done at the same time. The sticky sweat of th e unwanted siesta \naroused the scars of the sores in his armpits. The sky had cle ared but the sun \nhad not come out. Colonel Aureliano Buendía released a sonorous belch which \nbrought back the acidity of the soup to his palate and which was like a command \nfrom his organism to throw his blanket over his shoulde rs and go to the toilet. He \nstayed there longer than was necessary, crouched over the d ense fermentation \nthat was coming out of the wooden box until habit tol d him that it was time to start \nwork again. During the time he lingered he remembere d again that it was \nTuesday, and that José Arcadio Segundo had not come to t he workshop because \nit was payday on the banana company farms. That recollecti on, as all of those of \nthe past few years, led him to think about the war wit hout his realizing it. He \nremembered that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had once p romised to get him a \nhorse with a white star on its face and that he had nev er spoken about it again. \nThen he went on toward scattered episodes but he brough t them back without \nany judgment because since he could not think about anythi ng else, he had \nlearned to think coldly so that inescapable memories would  not touch any feeling. \nOn his way back to the workshop, seeing that the air was be ginning to dry out, he \ndecided that it was a good time to take a bath, but Am aranta had got there ahead \nof him. So he started on the second little fish of the  day. He was putting a hook \non the tail when the sun came out with such strength that the light creaked like a \nfishing boat. The air, which had been washed by the th ree-day drizzle, was filled \nwith flying ants. Then he came to the realization that  he felt like urinating and he",
            "21": "had been putting it off until he had finished fixing  the little fish. H e went out into \nthe courtyard at ten minutes after four, when he hear d the distant brass \ninstruments, the beating of the bass drum and the shout ing of the children, and \nfor the first time since his youth he knowingly fell in to a trap of nostalgia and \nrelived that prodigious afternoon Of the gypsies when h is father took him to see \nice. Santa Sofía de la Piedad dropped what she was do ing in the kitchen and ran \nto the door. \n“It’s the circus,” she shouted. \nInstead of going to the chestnut tree, Colonel Aureli ano Buendía also went to \nthe street door and mingled with the bystanders who, we re watching the parade. \nHe saw a woman dressed in gold sitting on the head of a n elephant. He saw a \nsad dromedary. He saw a bear dressed like a Dutch girl keep ing time to the \nmusic with a soup spoon and a pan. He saw the clowns doing  cartwheels at the \nend of the parade and once more he saw the face of his miserable solitude when \neverything had passed by and there was nothing but the b right expanse of the \nstreet and the air full of flying ants with a few onlo okers peering into the precipice \nof uncertainty. Then he went to the chestnut tree, thi nking about the circus, and \nwhile he urinated he tried to keep on thinking about  the circus, but he could no \nlonger find the memory. He pulled his head in between  his shoulders like a baby \nchick and remained motionless with his forehead against th e trunk of the chestnut \ntree. The family did not find him until the followin g day at eleven o’clock in the \nmorning when Santa Sofía de la Piedad went to throw  out the garbage in back \nand her attention was attracted by the descending vultur es."

            "0": "MEME’S LAST VACATIONS coincided with the period of mo urning for \nColonel Aureliano Buendía. The shuttered house was no  place for parties. They \nspoke in whispers, ate in silence, recited the rosary three  times a day, and even \nclavichord practice during the heat of siesta time had a  funereal echo. In spite of \nher secret hostility toward the colonel, it was Fernanda who imposed the rigor of \nthat mourning, impressed by the solemnity with which the  government exalted the \nmemory of its dead enemy. Aureliano Segundo, as was his c ustom came back to \nsleep in the house during his daughter’s vacation and Fe rnanda must have done \nsome. thing to regain her privileges as his legitimate w ife because the following \nyear Meme found a newborn little sister who against the  wi sh es of h er m oth er \nhad been baptized with the name Amaranta Úrsula. \nMeme had finished her course of study. The diploma that  certified her as a \nconcert clavichordist was ratified by the virtuosity with w hich she executed \npopular melodies of the seventeenth century at the gathe ring organized to \ncelebrate the completion of her studies and with which the period of mourning \ncame to in end. More than her art, the guests admired her duality. Her frivolous \nand even slightly infantile character did not seem up to any serious activity, but \nwhen she sat down at the clavichord she became a differe nt girl, one whose \nunforeseen maturity gave her the air of an adult. Tha t was how she had always \nbeen. She really did am have any definite vocation, b ut she had earned the \nhighest grades by means of inflexible discipline simply in order not to annoy her \nmother. They could have imposed on her an apprenticeshi p in any other field and \nthe results would have been the same. Since she had be en very small she had \nbeen troubled by Fernanda’s strictness, her custom of decid ing in favor of \nextremes; and she would have been capable of a much m ore difficult sacrifice",
            "1": "than the clavichord lessons merely not to run up against  her intransigence. \nDuring the graduation ceremonies she had the impressio n that the parchment \nwith Gothic letters and illuminated capitals was freeing  her from a compromise \nthat she had accepted not so much out of obedience as out  of convenience, and \nshe thought that from then on not even the insistent F ernanda would worry any \nmore about an instrument that even the nuns looked upon  as a museum fossil. \nDuring the first years she thought that her calculation s were mistaken because \nafter she had put half the town to sleep, not only in the parlor but also at all \ncharitable functions, school ceremonies, and patriotic celeb rations that took place \nin Macondo, her mother still invited to the house every newcomer whom she \nthought capable of appreciating her daughter’s virtues. Only after the death of \nAmaranta, when the family shut itself up again in a p eriod of mourning, was \nMeme able to lock the clavichord and forget the key in some  dresser drawer \nwithout Fernanda’s being annoyed on finding out when and through whose fault it \nhad been lost. Meme bore up under the exhibitions with  the same stoicism that \nshe had dedicated to her apprenticeship. It was the pri ce of her freedom. \nFernanda was so pleased with her docility and so proud of  the admiration that her \nart inspired that she was never against the house being  fall of girl friends, her \nspending the afternoon in the groves, and going to th e movies with Aureliano \nSegundo or some muted lady as long as the film was appro ved by Father Antonio \nIsabel from the pulpit. During those moments of relaxat ion Meme’s real tastes \nwere revealed. Her happiness lay at the other extreme from discipline, in noisy \nparties, in gossip about lovers, in prolonged sessions wit h her girl friends, where \nthey learned to smoke and talked about male business, and  where they once got \ntheir hands on some cane liquor and ended up naked, me asuring and comparing \nthe parts of their bodies. Meme would never forget tha t night when she arrived \nhome chewing licorice lozenges, and without noticing t heir consternation, sat \ndown at the table where Fernanda and Amaranta were eating dinner without",
            "2": "saying a word to each other. She had spent two tremendo us hours in the \nbedroom of a girl friend, weeping with laughter and  fear, and beyond an crises \nshe had found the rare feeling of. bravery that she n eeded in order to run away \nfrom school and tell her mother in one way or another that she could use the \nclavichord as an enema. Sitting at the head of the ta ble, drinking a chicken broth \nthat landed in her stomach like an elixir of resurrecti on, Meme then saw Fernanda \nand Amaranta wrapped in an accusatory halo of reality. She had to make a great \neffort not to throw at them their prissiness, their po verty of spirit their delusions of \ngrandeur. From the time of her second vacation she had  kn own  th at her fath er \nwas living at home only in order to keep up appearance s, and knowing Fernanda \nas she did and having arranged later to meet Petra Co tes, she thought that her \nfather was right. She also would have preferred being the daughter of the \nconcubine. In the haziness of the alcohol Meme thought w ith pleasure about the \nscandal that would have taken place if she were to expre ss her thoughts at that \nmoment, and the intimate satisfaction of her roguishne ss was so intense that \nFernanda noticed it. \n“What’s the matter?” she asked. \n“Nothing,” Meme answered. “I was only now discovering how  mu ch  I l ov ed \nyou both.” \nAmaranta was startled by the obvious burden of hate tha t the declaration \ncarried. But Fernanda felt so moved that she thought s he would go mad when \nMeme awoke at midnight with her head splitting with p ain and drowning in \nvomited gall. She gave her a vial of castor oil, put co mpresses on her stomach \nand ice cubes on her head, and she made her stay in bed  for five days and follow \nthe diet ordered by the new and outlandish French do ctor, who after examining \nher for more than two hours reached the foggy conclusio n that she had an \nailment peculiar to women. Having lost her courage, i n a miserable state of \ndemoralization, Meme had no other recourse but to bea r up under it. Úrsula,",
            "3": "completely blind by then but still active and lucid, was t he only one who guessed \nthe exact diagnosis. “As far as I can see,” she thought, “ that’s the same thing that \nhappens to drunken people.” But she not only rejected t he idea, she reproached \nherself for the frivolity of her thought. Aureliano S egundo felt a twinge of \nconscience when he saw Meme’s state of prostration and he promised himself to \ntake better care of her in the future. That was how th e relationship of jolly \ncomradeship was born between father and daughter, whi ch freed him for a time \nfrom the bitter solitude of his revels and freed her f rom Fernanda’s watchful eye \nwithout necessity of provoking the domestic crisis that seeme d inevitable by then. \nAt that time Aureliano Segundo postponed any appoint ments in order to be with \nMeme, to take her to the movies or the circus, and he spe nt the greater part of his \nidle time with her. In recent times his annoyance with t he absurd obesity that \nprevented him from tying his shoes and his abusive satisfa ction with all manner of \nappetites had began to sour his character. The discovery o f his daughter restored \nhis former joviality and the pleasure of being with he r was slowly leading him \naway from dissipation. Meme was entering a fruitful age . She was not beautiful, \nas Amaranta had never been, but on the other hand sh e was pleasant, \nuncomplicated, and she had the virtue of making a good  impression on people \nfrom the first moment. She had a modem spirit that wo unded the antiquated \nsobriety and poorly disguised miserly heart of Fernanda, a nd that, on the other \nhand, Aureliano Segundo took pleasure in developing.  It was he who resolved to \ntake her out of the bedroom she had occupied since chil dhood, where the fearful \neyes of the saints still fed her adolescent terrors, and h e furnished for her a room \nwith a royal bed, a large dressing table, and velvet c urtains, not realizing that he \nwas producing a second version of Petra Cotes’s room. He was so lavish with \nMeme that he did not even know how much money he gave  her because she \nherself would take it out of his pockets, and he kept abr east of every kind of new \nbeauty aid that arrived in the commissary of the banana company. Meme’s room",
            "4": "became filled with pumice-stone cushions to polish her nails with, hair curlers, \ntoothbrushes, drops to make her eyes languid, and so many and such new \ncosmetics and artifacts of beauty that every time Fernanda went into the room \nshe was scandalized by the idea that her daughter’s dress ing table must have \nbeen the same as those of the French matrons. Neverthel ess Fernanda divided \nher time in those days between little Amaranta Úrsula,  who was mischievous and \nsickly, and a touching correspondence with the invisible physi cians. So that when \nshe noticed the complicity between father and daughter t he only promise she \nextracted from Aureliano Segundo was that he would ne ver take Meme to Petra \nCotes’s house. It was a meaningless demand because the conc ubine was so \nannoyed with the comradeship between her lover and h is daughter that she did \nnot want anything to do with her. Petra was tormente d by an unknown fear, as if \ninstinct were telling her that Meme, by just wanting it , could succeed in what \nFernanda had been unable to do: deprive her of a lo ve that by then she \nconsidered assured until death. For the first time Aur eliano Segundo had to \ntolerate the harsh expressions and the violent tirade s of his concubine, and he \nwas even afraid that his wandering trunks would make the  return journey to his \nwife’s house. That did not happen. No one knew a man better than Petra Cotes \nknew her lover and she knew that the trunks would remai n where they had been \nsent because if Aureliano Segundo detested anything it w as complicating his life \nwith modifications and changes. So the trunks stayed wher e they were and Petra \nCotes set about reconquering the husband by sharpening t he only weapons that \nhis daughter could not use on him. It too was an unnecessa ry effort because \nMeme had no desire to intervene in her father’s affair s and if she had, it would \ncertainly have been in favor of the concubine. She ha d no time to bother \nanybody. She herself swept her room and made her bed, a s the nuns had taught \nher. In the morning she took care of her clothes, sewing  on the porch or using \nAmaranta’s old pedal machine. While the others were t aking their siestas she",
            "5": "would practice the clavichord for two hours, knowing th at the daily sacrifice would \nkeep Fernanda calm. For the same reason she continued gi ving concerts at \nchurch fairs and school parties, even though the request s were less and less \nfrequent. At nightfall she would fix herself up, put  on one of her simple dresses \nand her stiff high shoes, and if she had nothing to d o with her father she would go \nto the homes of her girl friends, where she would stay until dinnertime. It was rare \nthat Aureliano Segundo would not call for her then t o take her to the movies. \nAmong Meme’s friends there were three young American gi rls who broke \nthrough the electrified chicken fence barrier and made friends with girls from \nMacondo. One of them was Patricia Brown. Grateful for the hospitality of \nAureliano Segundo, Mr. Brown opened the doors of his house to Meme and \ninvited her to the Saturday dances, which were the onl y ones where gringos and \nnatives mingled. When Fernanda found out about it she  forgot abou t Am aran ta \nÚrsula and the invisible doctors for a moment and becam e very melodramatic. \n“Just think,” she said to Meme, “what the colonel must be thinking in his grave.” \nShe sought, of course, the backing of Úrsula. But the bl ind old woman, contrary \nto what everyone expected, saw nothing reproachable in  Meme’s going to the \ndances and making friends with American girls her own ag e as long as she kept \nher strict habits and was not converted to the Protestant  religion. Meme sensed \nthe thought of her great-great-grandmother very well  and the day after the dances \nshe would get up earlier than usual to go to mass. Fer nanda’s opposition lasted \nuntil the day when Meme broke down her resistance wit h the news that the \nAmericans wanted to hear her play the clavichord. The in strument was taken out \nof the house again and carried to Mr. Brown’s, where t he young concert artist \nreally did receive very sincere applause and the most enth usiastic \ncongratulations. From then on she was invited not only to the dances but also to \nthe Sunday swim parties in the pool and to lunch once  a week. Meme learned to \nswim like a professional, to play tennis, and to eat Vir ginia ham with slices of",
            "6": "pineapple. Among dances, swimming, and tennis she soon f ound herself getting \ninvolved in the English language. Aureliano Segundo  was so enthusiastic over \nthe progress of his daughter that from a traveling sale sman he bought a six-\nvolume English encyclopedia with many color prints which  M e m e  r e a d  i n  h e r  \nspare time. The reading occupied the attention that s he had formerly given to \ngossip about sweethearts and the experimental retreats t hat she would go \nthrough with her girl friends, not because it was impo sed as discipline but \nbecause she had lost all interest by then in talking abo ut mysteries that were in \nthe public domain. She looked back on the drunken episode  as an infantile \nadventure and it seemed so funny to her that she told A ureliano Segundo about it \nand he thought it was more amusing than she did. “If your mother only knew,” he \ntold her, doubling up with laughter, as he always said when he told her something \nin confidence. He had made her promise that she would let him know about her \nfirst love affair with the same confidence, and Meme to ld him that she liked a red-\nheaded American boy who had come to spend his vacation wit h his parents. \n“What do you know,” Aureliano Segundo said, laughing.  “If your mother only \nknew.” But Meme also told him that the boy had gone ba ck to his country and had \ndisappeared from sight. The maturity of her judgment ensured peace in the \nfamily. Aureliano Segundo then devoted more time to Petra Cotes, and although \nhis body and soul no longer permitted him the debauche s of days gone by, he \nlost no chance to arrange them and to dig out the accor dion, which by then had \nsome keys held in place by shoelaces. At home, Amaranta wa s weaving her \ninterminable shroud and Úrsula dragged about in her  decrepitude through the \ndepths of the shadows where the only thing that was stil l visible was the ghost of \nJosé Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree. Fernanda consolidated her \nauthority. Her monthly letters to her son José Arcadio at that time did not carry a \nstring of lies and she hid from him only her corresponde nce with the invisible",

It was an unexpecte d event. Although \nshe was old and isolated from everyone, she still looked firm and upright and with \nthe health of a rock that she had always had. No one kne w her thoughts since the \nafternoon on which she had given Colonel Gerineldo Márquez his final rejection \nand shut herself up to weep. She was not seen to cry dur ing the ascension to \nheaven of Remedios the Beauty or over the exterminati on of the Aurelianos or \nthe death of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who was the person she loved most in \nthis world, although she showed it only when they foun d his body under the \nchestnut tree. She helped pick up the body. She dressed hi m in his soldier’s \nuniform, shaved him, combed his hair, and waxed his must ache better than he \nhad ever done in his days of glory. No one thought that  there was any love in that \nact because they were accustomed to the familiarity of Am aranta with the rites of \ndeath. Fernanda was scandalized that she did not under stand the relationship of \nCatholicism with life but only its relationship with d eath, as if it were not a religion \nbut a compendium of funeral conventions. Amaranta was too wrapped up in the \neggplant patch of her memories to understand those su btle apologetics. She had \nreached old age with all of her nostalgias intact. When  she listened to the waltzes \nof Pietro Crespi she felt the same desire to weep that she had had in \nadolescence, as if time and harsh lessons had meant nothin g. The rolls of music \nthat she herself had thrown into the trash with the pr etext that they had rotted \nfrom dampness kept spinning and playing in her memory. Sh e had tried to sink \nthem into the swampy passion that she allowed herself wi th her nephew Aureli-\nano José and she tried to take refuge in the calm and v irile protection of Colonel \nGerineldo Márquez, but she had not been able to over come them, not even with",
            "8": "the most desperate act of her old age when she would b athe the small José \nArcadio three years before he was sent to the seminary and  caress him not as a \ngrandmother would have done with a grandchild, but a s a woman would have \ndone with a man, as it was said that the French matron s did and as she had \nwanted to do with Pietro Crespi at the age of twelve , fourteen, when she saw him \nin his dancing tights and with the magic wand with whic h he kept time to the \nmetronome. At times It pained her to have let that ou tpouring of misery follow its \ncourse, and at times it made her so angry that she would  prick her fingers with \nthe needles, but what pained her most and enraged her  most and made her most \nbitter was the fragrant and wormy guava grove of love t hat was dragging her \ntoward death. Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendía though t about his war, unable \nto avoid it, so Amaranta thought about Rebeca. But wh ile her brother had \nmanaged to sterilize his memories, she had only managed  to make hers more \nscalding. The only thing that she asked of God for many years was that he would \nnot visit on her the punishment of dying before Rebeca.  Every time she passed \nby her house and noted the progress of destruction she to ok comfort in the idea \nthat God was listening to her. One afternoon, when sh e was sewing on the porch, \nshe was assailed by the certainty that she would be sitting  in  th at pl ace, in  th e \nsame position, and under the same light when they broug ht her the news of \nRebeca’s death. She sat down to wait for it, as one wa its for a letter, and the fact \nwas that at one time she would pull off buttons to sew  them on again so that \ninactivity would not make the wait longer and more anx ious. No one in the house \nrealized that at that time Amaranta was sewing a fine  shroud for Rebeca. Later \non, when Aureliano Triste told how he had seen her ch anged into an apparition \nwith leathery skin and a few golden threads on her skull,  Amaranta was not \nsurprised because the specter described was exactly what she ha d been \nimagining for some time. She had decided to restore Re beca’s corpse, to \ndisguise with paraffin the damage to her face and make a wig for her from the",

She would manufacture a beautiful corpse, with the linen \nshroud and a plush-lined coffin with purple trim. and  s h e  w o u l d  p u t  i t  a t  t h e  \ndisposition of the worms with splendid funeral ceremonie s. She worked out the \nplan with such hatred that it made her tremble to t hink about the scheme, which \nshe would have carried out in exactly the same way if it had been done out of \nlove, but she would not allow herself to become upset  by the confusion and went \non perfecting the details so minutely that she came to  be more than a specialist \nand was a virtuoso in the rites of death. The only thin g that she did not keep In \nmind in her fearsome plan was that in spite of her pl eas to God she might die \nbefore Rebeca. That was, in fact, what happened. At th e final moment, however, \nAmaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary,  free of all bitterness \nbecause death had awarded her the privilege of announ cing itself several years \nahead of time. She saw it on one burning afternoon se wing with her on the porch \na short time after Meme had left for school. She saw it  because it was a woman \ndressed in blue with long hair, with a sort of antiqua ted look, and with a certain \nresemblance to Pilar Ternera during the time when sh e had helped with the \nchores in the kitchen. Fernanda was present several times and did not see her, in \nspite of the fact that she was so real, so human, and on  one occasion asked of \nAmaranta the favor of threading a needle. Death did  not tell her when she was \ngoing to die or whether her hour was assigned before t hat of Rebeca, but ordered \nher to begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of April. She was authorized \nto make it as complicated and as fine as she wanted, but  just as honestly \nexecuted as Rebeca’s, and she was told that she would d ie without pain, fear, or \nbitterness at dusk on the day that she finished it. Tryi ng to waste the most time \npossible, Amaranta ordered some rough flax and spun the  thread herself. She did \nit so carefully that the work alone took four years. Then  she started the sewing. \nAs she got closer to the unavoidable end she began to  understand that only a \nmiracle would allow her to prolong the work past Rebec a’s death, but the very",
            "10": "concentration gave her the calmness that she needed to acce pt the idea of \nfrustration. It was then that she understood the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía’s little gold fishes. The world was reduced to the surface of her skin and \nher inner self was safe from all bitterness. It pained h er not to have had that \nrevelation many years before when it had still been poss ible to purify memories \nand reconstruct the universe under a new light and evoke without trembling Pietro \nCrespi’s smell of lavender at dusk and rescue Rebeca fro m her slough of misery, \nnot out of hatred or out of love but because of the m easureless understanding of \nsolitude. The hatred that she noticed one night in Me mes words did not upset her \nbecause it was directed at her, but she felt the repeti tion of another adolescence \nthat seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and that, ho wever, was already \ntainted with rancor. But by then her acceptance of her f ate was so deep that she \nwas not even upset by the certainty that all possibilities of rectification were \nclosed to her. Her only objective was to finish the shro ud. Instead of slowing it \ndown with useless detail as she had done in the beginni ng, she speeded up the \nwork.

But \non the following day, at eight in the morning, she t ook the last stitch in the most \nbeautiful piece of work that any woman had ever finis hed, and she announced \nwithout the least bit of dramatics that she was going to  die at dusk. She not only \ntold the family but the whole town, because Amaranta h ad conceived of the idea \nthat she could make up for a life of meanness with one l ast favor to the world, \nand she thought that no one was in a better position to take letters to the dead.",
            "12": "The news that Amaranta Buendía was sailing at dusk carryin g the mail of \ndeath spread throughout Macondo before noon, and at t hree in the afternoon \nthere was a whole carton full of letters in the parlor . Those who did not want to \nwrite gave Amaranta verbal messages, which she wrote d own in a notebook with \nthe name and date of death of the recipient. “Don’t worry,” she told the senders. \n“The first thing I’ll do when I get there is to ask for  him and give him your \nmessage.” It was farcical. Amaranta did not show any upse t or the slightest sign \nof grief, and she even looked a bit rejuvenated by a  duty accomplished. She was \nas straight and as thin as ever. If it had not been for  her hardened cheekbones \nand a few missing teeth, she would have looked much y ounger than she really \nwas. She herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch \nand told them to place it in her grave in a way best t o protect it from the \ndampness. In the morning she had a carpenter called wh o took her \nmeasurements for the coffin as she stood in the parlor,  as if it were for a new \ndress. She showed such vigor in her last hours that Fern anda thought she was \nmaking fun of everyone. Úrsula, with the experience that  Buendías died without \nany illness, did not doubt at all that Amaranta had re ceived an omen of death, but \nin any case she was tormented by the fear that with the business of the letters \nand the anxiety of the senders for them to arrive quickl y they would bury her alive \nin their confusion. So she set about clearing out the house, arguing with the \nintruders as she shouted at them, and by four in the a fternoon she was \nsuccessful. At that time Amaranta had finished dividing h er things among the \npoor and had left on the severe coffin of unfinished b oards only the change of \nclothing and the simple cloth slippers that she would wea r in death. She did not \nneglect that precaution because she remembered that when  C o l on e l  A u r el i an o \nBuendía died they had to buy a pair of new shoes for h im because all he had left \nwere the bedroom slippers that he wore in the workshop . A little before five \nAureliano Segundo came to fetch Meme for the concert an d was surprised that",
            "13": "the house was prepared for the funeral. if anyone seeme d alive at the moment it \nwas the serene Amaranta, who had even had enough time  to cut her corns. \nAureliano Segundo and Meme took leave of her with mo cking farewells and \npromised her that on the following Saturday they would  have a big resurrection \nparty. Drawn by the public talk that Amaranta Buendía w as receiving letters for \nthe dead, Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five o’clock for the last rites and he had \nto wait for more than fifteen minutes for the recipie nt to come out of her bath. \nWhen he saw her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and  with her hair loose over \nher shoulders, the decrepit parish priest thought that it was a trick and sent the \naltar boy away. He thought however, that he would take  a d v a n t a g e  o f  t h e  \noccasion to have Amaranta confess after twenty years of reti cence. Amaranta \nanswered simply that she did not need spiritual help of  any kind because her \nconscience was clean. Fernanda was scandalized. Without cari ng that people \ncould hear her she asked herself aloud what horrible s in Amaranta had \ncommitted to make her prefer an impious death to the s hame of confession. \nThereupon Amaranta lay down and made Úrsula give pub lic testimony as to her \nvirginity. \n“Let no one have any illusions,” she shouted so that Fe rnanda would hear \nher. “Amaranta Buendía is leaving this world just as she came into it. \nShe did not get up again. Lying on cushions, as if sh e really were ill, she \nbraided her long hair and rolled it about her ears a s death had told her it should \nbe on her bier. Then she asked Úrsula for a mirror an d for the first time in more \nthan forty years she saw her face, devastated by age and ma rtyrdom, and she \nwas surprised at how much she resembled the mental imag e that she had of \nherself. Úrsula understood by the silence in the bedroom  th a t  i t  h a d  b e gu n  t o  \ngrow dark. \n“Say good-bye to Fernanda,” she begged her. One minute  of reconciliation is \nworth more than a whole life of friendship.”",
            "14": "“It’s of no use now,” Amaranta replied. \nMeme could not help thinking about her when they turne d on the lights on \nthe improvised stage and she began the second part of the program. In the \nmiddle of the piece someone whispered the news in her ear and the session \nstopped. When he arrived home, Aureliano Segundo had  to push his way through \nthe crowd to see the corpse of the aged virgin, ugly and  discolored, with the black \nbandage on her hand and wrapped in the magnificent s hroud. She was laid out in \nthe parlor beside the box of letters. \nÚrsula did not get up again after the nine nights of mourning for Amaranta, \nSanta Sofía de la Piedad took care of her. She took he r meals to her bedroom \nand annatto water for her to wash in and she kept he r up to date on everything \nthat happened in Macondo. Aureliano Segundo visited her frequently and he \nbrought her clothing which she would place beside the bed along with the things \nmost indispensable for daily life, so that in a short ti me she had built up a world \nwithin reach of her hand. She managed to arouse a gr eat love in little Amaranta \nÚrsula, who was just like her, and whom she taught how to read. Her lucidity, the \nability to be sufficient un herself made one think that she was naturally conquered \nby the weight of her hundred years, but even though it  was obvious that she was \nhaving trouble seeing, no one suspected that she was tota lly blind. She had so \nmuch time at her disposal then and so much interior sil ence to watch over the life \nof the house that she was the first to notice Meme’s sile nt tribulation. \n“Come here,” she told her. “Now that were alone, conf ess to this poor old \nwoman what’s bothering you.” \nMeme avoided the conversation with a short laugh. Úrs ula did not insist, but \nshe ended up confirming her suspicions when Meme did not come back to visit \nher. She knew that she was getting up earlier than u sual, that she did not have a \nmoment’s rest as she waited for the time for her to go out, that she spent whole \nnights walking back and forth in the adjoining bedroom,  and that the fluttering of a",
            "15": "butterfly would bother her. On one occasion she said th at she was going to see \nAureliano Segundo and Úrsula was surprised that Fernand a’s imagination was so \nlimited when her husband came to the house looking for his daughter. It was too \nobvious that Meme was involved in secret matters, in pressi ng matters, in \nrepressed anxieties long before the night that Fernand a upset the house because \nshe caught her kissing a man in the movies. \nMeme was so wrapped up in herself at that time that she  accused Úrsula of \nhaving told on her. Actually, she told on herself. For a long time she had been \nleaving a trail that would have awakened the most dro wsy person and it took \nFernanda so long to discover it because she too was befog ged, by her \nrelationship with the invisible doctors. Even so she fin ally noticed the deep \nsilences, the sudden outbursts, the changes in mood, and the contradictions of \nher daughter. She set about on a disguised but implaca ble vigilance. She let her \ngo out with her girl friends as always, she helped her g et dressed for the \nSaturday parties, and she never asked an embarrassing quest ion that might \narouse her. She already had a great deal of proof tha t Meme was doing different \nthings from what she said, and yet she would give no in dication of her suspicions, \nhoping for the right moment. One night Meme said th at she was going to the \nmovies with her father. A short time later Fernanda h eard the fireworks of the \ndebauch and the unmistakable accordion of Aureliano Se gundo from the direction \nof Petra Cotes’s place. Then she got dressed, went to th e movie theater, and in \nthe darkness of the seats she recognized her daughter. The upsetting feeling of \ncertainty stopped her from seeing the man she was kissing, but she managed to \nhear his tremulous voice in the midst of the deafeni ng shouts and laughter of the \naudience. “I’m sorry, love,” she heard him say, and she to ok Meme out of the \nplace without saying a word to her, put her through th e shame of parading her \nalong the noisy Street of the Turks, and locked her up in  her bedroom.",
            "16": "On the following day at six in the afternoon, Fernand a recognized the voice \nof the man who came to call on her. He was young, sallow , with dark and \nmelancholy eyes which would not have startled her so muc h if she had known the \ngypsies, and a dreamy air that to any woman with a hear t less rigid would have \nbeen enough to make her understand her daughter’s moti ves. He was wearing a \nshabby linen suit with shoes that showed the desperate d efense of superimposed \npatches of white zinc, and in his hand he was carrying a st raw hat he had bought \nthe Saturday before. In all of his life he could never  have been as frightened as at \nthat moment, but he had a dignity and presence that sp ared him from humiliation \nand a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnis hed hands and nails that \nhad been shattered by rough work. Fernanda, however, needed only one look to \nguess his status of mechanic. She saw that he was wearing hi s one Sunday suit \nand that underneath his shirt he bore the rash of th e banana company. She \nwould not let him speak. She would not even let him co me through the door, \nwhich a moment later she had to close because the house was filled with yellow \nbutterflies. \n“Go away,” she told him. “You’ve got no reason to come ca lling on any \ndecent person.” \nHis name was Mauricio Babilonia. He had been born and raised in Macondo, \nand he was an apprentice mechanic in the banana company garage. Meme had \nmet him by chance one afternoon when she went with Pa tricia Brown to get a car \nto take a drive through the groves. Since the chauffeu r was sick they assigned \nhim to take them and Meme was finally able to satisfy her  desire to sit next to the \ndriver and see what he did. Unlike the regular chauf feur, Mauricio Babilonia gave \nher a practical lesson. That was during the time that Me me was beginning to \nfrequent Mr. Brown’s house and it was still considered im proper for a lady to drive \na car. So she was satisfied with the technical informatio n and she did not see \nMauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later on she would remember that",
            "17": "during the drive her attention had been called to hi s masculine beauty, except for \nthe coarseness of his hands, but that afterward she had me ntioned to Patricia \nBrown that she had been bothered by his rather proud sense of security. The first \nSaturday that she went to the movies with her father she saw Mauricio Babilonia \nagain, with his linen suit, sitting a few seats away fro m them, and she noticed that \nhe was not paying much attention to the film in orde r to turn around and look at \nher. Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that. Afterw ard Mauricio Babilonia \ncame over to say hello to Aureliano Segundo and only th en did Meme find out \nthat they knew each other because he had worked in Aur eliano Triste’s early \npower plant and he treated her father with the air of an employee. That fact \nrelieved the dislike that his pride had caused in her. They had never been alone \ntogether nor had they spoken except in way of greeting, the night when she \ndreamed that he was saving her from a shipwreck and she did not feel gratitude \nbut rage. It was as if she had given him the opportunit y he was waiting for, since \nMeme yearned for just the opposite, not only with Mauri cio Babilonia but with any \nother man who was interested in her. Therefore she wa s so indignant after the \ndream that instead of hating him, she felt an irresist ible urge to see him. The \nanxiety became more intense during the course of the week and on Saturday it \nwas so pressing that she had to make a great effort for M auricio Babilonia not to \nnotice that when he greeted her in the movies her hea rt was in her mouth. Dazed \nby a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, she gave h im her hand for the first \ntime and only then did Mauricio Babilonia let himself shake hers. Meme managed \nto repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the  repentance changed \nimmediately into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his h and too was sweaty and \ncold. That night she realized that she would not have  a moment of rest until she \nshowed Mauricio Babilonia the uselessness of his aspiration  and she spent the \nweek turning that anxiety about in her mind. She resor ted to all kinds of useless \ntricks so that Patricia Brown would go get the car with h er. Finally she made use",
            "18": "of the American redhead who was spending his vacation i n Macondo at that time \nand with the pretext of learning about new models of  cars she had him take her to \nthe garage. From the moment she saw him Meme let he rself be deceived by \nherself and believed that what was really going on was that she could not bear \nthe desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was made indignant by \nthe certainty that he understood that when he saw her a rrive. \n“I came to see the new models,” Meme said.  \n“That’s a fine excuse,” he said. \nMeme realized that he was burning in the heat of his p ride, and she \ndesperately looked for a way to humiliate him. But he w ould not give her any \ntime. “Don’t get upset,” he said to her in a low voice.  “It’s not the first time that a \nwoman has gone crazy over a man.” She felt so defeated that she left the garage \nwithout seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and \nweeping with indignation. The American redhead, who was really beginning to \ninterest her, looked like a baby in diapers. It was then  that she realized that the \nyellow butterflies preceded the appearances of Mauricio B abilonia. She had seen \nthem before, especially over the garage, and she had th ought that they were \ndrawn by the smell of paint. Once she had seen them flut tering about her head \nbefore she went into the movies. But when Mauricio Babi lonia began to pursue \nher like a ghost that only she could identify in the crow d, she understood that the \nbutterflies had something to do with him. Mauricio Ba bilonia was always in the \naudience at the concerts, at the movies, at high mass, and she did not have to \nsee him to know that he was there, because the butterfl ies were always there. \nOnce Aureliano Segundo became so impatient with the su ffocating fluttering that \nshe felt the impulse to confide her secret to him as she  had promised, but instinct \ntold her that he would laugh as usual and say: “What w ould your mother say if \nshe found out?” One morning, while she was pruning th e roses, Fernanda let out \na cry of fright and had Meme taken away from the spot wh ere she was, which",
            "19": "was the same place in the garden where Remedios the Bea uty had gone up to \nheaven. She had thought for an instant that the mira cle was going to be repeated \nwith her daughter, because she had been bothered by a  s u d d e n  f l a p p i n g  o f  \nwings. It was the butterflies. Meme saw them as if they h ad suddenly been born \nout of the light and her heart gave a turn. At that  m o m en t  M au r i ci o  B a b i l on i a \ncame in with a package that according to what he said, wa s a present from \nPatricia Brown. Meme swallowed her blush, absorbed her  tri bu l ati on , and ev en \nmanaged a natural smile as she asked him the favor of leaving it on the railing \nbecause her hands were dirty from the garden. The only thing that Fernanda \nnoted in the man whom a few months later she was to ex pel from the house \nwithout remembering where she had seen him was the bil ious texture of his skin. \n“He’s a very strange man,” Fernanda said. “You can see in  his face that he’s \ngoing to die.” \nMeme thought that her mother had been impressed by the  butterflies When \nthey finished pruning the row bushes she washed her h ands and took the \npackage to her bedroom to open it. It was a kind of Ch inese toy, made up of five \nconcentric boxes, and in the last one there was a card labo riously inscribed by \nsomeone who could barely write: We’ll get together Saturday at the movies . \nMeme felt with an aftershock that the box had been on the railing for a long time \nwithin reach of Fernanda’s curiosity, and although she was flattered by the \naudacity and ingenuity of Mauricio Babilonia, she was m oved by his Innocence in \nexpecting that she would keep the date. Meme knew at that time that Aureliano \nSegundo had an appointment on Saturday night. Nevert heless, the fire of anxiety \nburned her so much during the course of the week that o n Saturday she \nconvinced her father to leave her alone in the theater  and come back for her after \nthe show. A nocturnal butterfly fluttered about her h ead while the lights were on. \nAnd then it happened. When the lights went out, Maur icio Babilonia sat down \nbeside her. Meme felt herself splashing in a bog of he sitation from which she",
            "20": "could only be rescued, as had occurred in her dreams, by t hat man smelling of \ngrease whom she could barely see in the shadows. \n“If you hadn’t come,” he said, “You never would have se en me again.” \nMeme felt the weight of his hand on her knee and she  knew that they were \nboth arriving at the other side of abandonment at tha t instant. \n“What shocks me about you,” she said, smiling, “is that you  always say \nexactly what you shouldn’t be saying.” \nShe lost her mind over him. She could not sleep and sh e lost her appetite \nand sank so deeply into solitude that even her father be came an annoyance. She \nworked out an intricate web of false dates to throw Fer nanda off the track, lost \nsight of her girl friends, leaped over conventions to b e with Mauricio Babilonia at \nany time and at any place. At first his crudeness bothered  her. The first time that \nthey were alone on the deserted fields behind the gara ge he pulled her \nmercilessly into an animal state that left her exhausted.  It took her time to realize \nthat it was also a form of tenderness and it was then th at she lost her calm and \nlived only for him, upset by the desire to sink into his st upefying odor of grease \nwashed off by lye. A short time before the death of Am aranta she suddenly \nstumbled into in open space of lucidity within the madne ss and she trembled \nbefore the uncertainty of the future. Then she heard about a woman who made \npredictions from cards and went to see her in secret. It w as Pilar Ternera. As \nsoon as Pilar saw her come in she was aware of Meme’s hi dden motives. “Sit \ndown,” she told her. “I don’t need cards to tell the f uture of a Buendía,” Meme did \nnot know and never would that the centenarian witch was her great-grandmother. \nNor would she have believed it after the aggressive r ealism with which she \nrevealed to her that the anxiety of falling in love could not find repose except in \nbed. It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilon ia’s, but Meme resisted \nbelieving it because underneath it all she imagined th at it had been inspired by \nthe poor judgment of a mechanic. She thought then th at love on one side was",
            "21": "defeating love on the other, because it was characteristi c of men to deny hunger \nonce their appetites were satisfied. Pilar Ternera not only cleared up that mistake, \nshe also offered the old canopied bed where she had conce ived Arcadio, Meme’s \ngrandfather, and where afterward she conceived Aureli ano José. She also taught \nher how to avoid an unwanted conception by means of the  e v a p o r a t i o n  o f  \nmustard plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could \nexpel “even the remorse of conscience.” That interview i nstilled In Meme the \nsame feeling of bravery that she had felt on the drunk en evening. Amaranta’s \ndeath, however, obliged her to postpone the decision.  While the nine nights \nlasted she did not once leave the side of Mauricio Bab ilonia, who mingled with \nthe crowd that invaded the house. Then came the long p eriod of mourning and \nthe obligatory withdrawal and they separated for a tim e. Those were days of such \ninner agitation, such irrepressible anxiety, and so man y repressed urges that on \nthe first evening that Meme was able to get out she we nt straight to Pilar \nTernera’s. She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia, wi thout resistance, without \nshyness, without formalities, and with a vocation that was so fluid and an intuition \nthat was so wise that a more suspicious man than hers wou ld have confused \nthem with obvious experience. They made love twice a w eek for more than three \nmonths, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano  Segundo, who believed \nwithout suspicion in his daughter’s alibis simply in or der to set her free from her \nmother’s rigidity. \nOn the night that Fernanda surprised them in the mov ies Aureliano Segundo \nfelt weighted down by the burden of his conscience and he visited Meme in the \nbedroom where Fernanda kept her locked up, trusting th at she would reveal to \nhim the confidences that she owed him. But Meme denied  everything. She was \nso sure of herself, so anchored in her solitude that Aur eliano Segundo had the \nimpression that no link existed between them anymore, tha t the comradeship and \nthe complicity were nothing but an illusion of the pa st. He thought of speaking to",
            "22": "Mauricio Babilonia, thinking that his authority as his former boss would make him \ndesist from his plans, but Petra Cotes convinced him that  it was a woman’s \nbusiness, so he was left floating in a limbo of indecisi on, barely sustained by the \nhope that the confinement would put an end to his dau ghter’s troubles. \nMeme showed no signs of affliction. On the contrary, fro m the next room \nÚrsula perceived the peaceful rhythm of her sleep, the serenity of her tasks, the \norder of her meals, and the good health of her digest ion. The only thing that \nintrigued Úrsula after almost two months of punishmen t was that Meme did not \ntake a bath in the morning like everyone else, but at se ven in the evening. Once \nshe thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Mem e was so distant, \nconvinced that she had given her away, that she preferr ed not to disturb her with \nthe impertinences, of a great-great-grandmother. The yellow butterflies would \ninvade the house at dusk. Every night on her way back from  h e r  b a t h  M e m e  \nwould find a desperate Fernanda killing butterflies wi th an insecticide bomb. “This \nis terrible,” she would say, “All my life they told me t hat butterflies at night bring \nbad luck.” One night while Meme was in the bathroom, F ernanda went into her \nbedroom by chance and there were so many butterflies tha t she could scarcely \nbreathe. She grabbed for the nearest piece of cloth to  shoo them away and her \nheart froze with terror as she connected her daughter’s evening baths with the \nmustard plasters that rolled onto the floor. She did n ot wait for an opportune \nmoment as she had the first time. On the following day she invited the new mayor \nto lunch. Like her, he had come down from the highlan ds, and she asked him to \nstation a guard in the backyard because she had the impre ssion that hens were \nbeing stolen. That night the guard brought down Maur icio Babilonia as he was \nlifting up the tiles to get into the bathroom where Meme was waiting for him, \nnaked and trembling with love among the scorpions and b utterflies as she had \ndone almost every night for the past few months. A bull et lodged in his spinal \ncolumn reduced him to his bed for the rest of his life. He died of old age in",
            "23": "solitude, without a moan, without a protest, without a single moment of betrayal, \ntormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies, wh o did not give him a \nmoment’s peace, and ostracized as a chicken thief."

            "0": "THE EVENTS that would deal Macondo its fatal blow wer e just showing \nthemselves when they brought Meme Buendía’s son home. T he public situation \nwas so uncertain then that no one had sufficient spirit to become involved with \nprivate scandals, so that Fernanda was able to count on a n atmosphere that \nenabled her to keep the child hidden as if he had never  existed. She had to take \nhim in because the circumstances under which they brought  him made rejection \nimpossible. She had to tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because \nat the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go th rough with her inner \ndetermination to drown him in the bathroom cistern. S he locked him up in Colonel \nAureliano Buendía’s old workshop. She succeeded in convinci ng Santa Sofía de \nla Piedad that she had found him floating in a basket . Úrsula would die without \never knowing his origin. Little Amaranta Úrsula, who  went into the workshop once \nwhen Fernanda was feeding the child, also believed the  version of the floating \nbasket. Aureliano Segundo, having broken finally with hi s wife because of the \nirrational way in which she handled Meme’s tragedy, di d not know of the \nexistence of his grandson until three years after they brou ght him home, when the \nchild escaped from captivity through an oversight on Ferna nda’s part and ap-\npeared on the porch for a fraction of a second, naked, with matted hair, and with \nan impressive sex organ that was like a turkey’s wattles, a s if he were not a \nhuman child but the encyclopedia definition of a canni bal. \nFernanda had not counted on that nasty trick of her inco rrigible fate. The \nchild was like the return of a shame that she had thou ght exiled by her from the \nhouse forever. As soon as they carried off Mauricio Babi lonia with his shattered \nspinal column, Fernanda had worked out the most minute details of a plan \ndestined to wipe out all traces of the burden. Without  consulting her husband, she",
            "1": "packed her bags, put the three changes of clothing that  her daughter would need \ninto a small suitcase, and went to get her in her bedr oom a half hour before the \ntrain arrived. \n“Let’s go, Renata,” she told her. \nShe gave no explanation. Meme, for her part, did no t expect or want any. \nShe not only did not know where they were going, but  i t wou l d h av e been th e \nsame to her if they had been taking her to the slaughte rhouse. She had not \nspoken again nor would she do so for the rest of her li fe from the time that she \nheard the shot in the backyard and the simultaneous cry of  pain from Mauricio \nBabilonia. When her mother ordered her out of the b edroom she did not comb her \nhair or wash her face and she got into the train as if she were walking in her \nsleep, not even noticing the yellow butterflies that we re still accompanying her. \nFernanda never found out nor did she take the troubl e to, whether that stony \nsilence was a determination of her will or whether she  had become mute because \nof the impact of the tragedy. Meme barely took notice of  the journey through the \nformerly enchanted region. She did not see the shady, e ndless banana groves on \nboth sides of the tracks. She did not see the white houses of the gringos or their \ngardens, dried out by dust and heat, or the women in s horts and blue-striped \nshirts playing cards on the terraces. She did not see the o xcarts on the dusty \nroads loaded down with bunches of bananas. She did not  see the girls diving into \nthe transparent rivers like tarpons, leaving the passenge rs on the train with the \nbitterness of their splendid breasts, or the miserable hu ts of the workers all \nhuddled together where Mauricio Babilonia’s yellow b utterflies fluttered about and \nin the doorways of which there were green and squalid children sitting on their \npots, and pregnant women who shouted insults at the t rain. That fleeting vision, \nwhich had been a celebration for her when she came ho me from school, passed \nthrough Meme’s heart without a quiver. She did not l ook out of the window, not \neven when the burning dampness of the groves ended and  the train went through",
            "2": "a poppy-laden plain where the carbonized skeleton of th e Spanish galleon still sat \nand then came out into the dear air alongside the fr othy, dirty sea where almost a \ncentury before José Arcadio Buendía’s illusions had met def eat. \nAt five o’clock in the afternoon, when they had come to the last station in the \nswamp, she got out of the train because Fernanda made h er. They got into a \nsmall carriage that looked like an enormous bat, drawn b y an asthmatic horse, \nand they went through the desolate city in the endless str eets of which, split by \nsaltiness, there was the sound of a piano lesson just like t he one that Fernanda \nheard during the siestas of her adolescence. They went on  board a riverboat, the \nwooden wheel of which had a sound of conflagration, a nd whose rusted metal \nplates reverberated like the mouth of an oven. Meme s hut herself up in her cabin. \nTwice a day Fernanda left a plate of food by her bed a nd twice a day she took it \naway intact, not because Meme had resolved to die of hun ger, but because even \nthe smell of food was repugnant to her and her stomach  rejected even water. Not \neven she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted  the mustard vapors, just as \nFernanda did not know until almost a year later, whe n they brought the child. In \nthe suffocating cabin, maddened by the vibration of th e metal plates and the \nunbearable stench of the mud stirred up by the paddle  wheel, Meme lost track of \nthe days. Much time had passed when she saw the last yell ow butterfly destroyed \nin the blades of the fan and she admitted as an irre mediable truth that Mauricio \nBabilonia had died. She did not let herself be defea ted by resignation, however. \nShe kept on thinking about him during the arduous mule  back crossing of the \nhallucinating plateau where Aureliano Segundo had b ecome lost when he was \nlooking for the most beautiful woman who had ever app eared on the face of the \nearth, and when they went over the mountains along In dian trails and entered the \ngloomy city in whose stone alleys the funereal bronze bell s of thirty-two churches \ntolled. That night they slept in the abandoned colonia l mansion on boards that \nFernanda laid on the floor of a room invaded by weed s, wrapped in the shreds of",
            "3": "curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell  to pieces with every turn of \nthe body. Meme knew where they were because in the fli ght of her insomnia she \nsaw pass by the gentleman dressed in black whom they deliver ed to the house \ninside a lead box on one distant Christmas Eve. On the following day, after mass, \nFernanda took her to a somber building that Meme recog nized immediately from \nher mother’s stories of the convent where they had raised her to be a queen, and \nthen she understood that they had come to the end of the journey. While \nFernanda was speaking to someone in the office next do or, Meme remained in a \nparlor checkered with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, still wearing an \netamine dress with small black flowers and stiff high shoe s which were swollen by \nthe cold of the uplands. She was standing in the center of the parlor thinking \nabout Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of l ight from the stained glass \nwindows when a very beautiful novice came out of the of fice carrying her suitcase \nwith the three changes of clothing. As she passed Meme sh e took her hand \nwithout stopping. \n“Come, Renata,” she said to her. \nMeme took her hand and let herself be led. The last ti me that Fernanda saw \nher, trying to keep up with the novice, the iron grati ng of the cloister had just \nclosed behind her. She was still thinking about Mauricio  Babilonia, his smell of \ngrease, and his halo of butterflies, and she would keep on thinking about him for \nall the days of her life until the remote autumn morn ing when she died of old age, \nwith her name changed and her head shaved and witho ut ever having spoken a \nword, in a gloomy hospital in Cracow. \nFernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by a rmed police. During \nthe trip she noticed the tension of the passengers, the  military preparations in the \ntowns along the line, and an atmosphere rarified by th e certainty that something \nserious was going to happen, but she had no informatio n until she reached \nMacondo and they told her that José Arcadio Segundo was i nciting the workers of",
            "4": "the banana company to strike. “That’s all we need,” Fern anda said to herself. “An \nanarchist in the family.” The strike broke out two weeks l ater and it did not have \nthe dramatic consequences that had been feared. The wor kers demanded that \nthey not be obliged to cut and load bananas on Sundays,  and the position \nseemed so just that even Father Antonio Isabel intercede d in its favor because he \nfound it in accordance with the laws of God. That victor y, along with other actions \nthat were initiated during the following months, dre w the colorless José Arcadio \nSegundo out of his anonymity, for people had been accust omed to say that he \nwas only good for filling up the town with French who res. With the same \nimpulsive decision with which he had auctioned off his  fighting cocks in order to \norganize a harebrained boat business, he gave up his po sition as foreman in the \nbanana company and took the side of the workers. Quite so on he was pointed \nout as the agent of an international conspiracy against public order. One night, \nduring the course of a week darkened by somber rumors, he miraculously \nescaped four revolver shots taken at him by an unknown p arty as he was leaving \na secret meeting. The atmosphere of the following mont hs was so tense that \neven Úrsula perceived it in her dark corner, and she ha d the impression that once \nmore she was living through the dangerous times when he r son Aureliano carried \nthe homeopathic pills of subversion in his pocket. She tri ed to speak to José \nArcadio Segundo, to let him know about that precedent,  bu t Au rel ian o S egun do \ntold her that since the night of the attempt on his l ife no one knew his \nwhereabouts. \n“Just like Aureliano,” Úrsula exclaimed. “It’s as if the world were repeating \nitself.” \nFernanda, was immune to the uncertainty of those days. She had no contact \nwith the outside world since the violent altercation sh e had had with her husband \nover her having decided Memes fate without his consent.  Aureliano Segundo was \nprepared to rescue his daughter with the help of the p olice if necessary, but",
            "5": "Fernanda showed him some papers that were proof that she had entered the \nconvent of her own free will. Meme had indeed signed  once she was already \nbehind the iron grating and she did it with the sam e indifference with which she \nhad allowed herself to be led away. Underneath it al l, Aureliano Segundo did not \nbelieve in the legitimacy of the proof. Just as he never  believed that Mauricio \nBabilonia had gone into the yard to steal chickens, but both expedients served to \nease his conscience, and thus he could go back without remorse  u n d e r  t h e  \nshadow of Petra Cotes, where he revived his noisy revel ry and unlimited \ngourmandizing. Foreign to the restlessness of the town , deaf to Úrsula’s quiet \npredictions. Fernanda gave the last tam to the screw of her preconceived plan. \nShe wrote a long letter to her son José Arcadio, who wa s then about to take his \nfirst orders, and in it she told him that his sister Rena ta had expired in the peace \nof the Lord and as a consequence of the black vomit. The n she put Amaranta \nÚrsula under the care of Santa Sofía de la Piedad and  dedicated herself to \norganizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, which had been upset \nby Meme’s trouble. The first thing that she did was to set a definite date for the \npostponed telepathic operation. But the invisible doctor s answered her that it was \nnot wise so long as the state of social agitation continue d in Macondo. She was \nso urgent and so poorly Informed that she explained to  them In another letter that \nthere was no such state of agitation and that everythi ng was the result of the \nlunacy of a brother-in-law of hers who was fiddling aro und at that time in that \nlabor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and \nriverboats before. They were still not in agreement on  the hot Wednesday when \nan aged nun knocked at the door bearing a small basket  on her arm. When she \nopened the door Santa Sofía de la Piedad thought th at it was a gift and tried to \ntake the small basket that was covered with a lovely lace w rap. But the nun \nstopped her because she had instructions to give it person ally and with the \nstrictest secrecy to Doña Fernanda del Carpio de Buendía.  It was Meme’s son.",
            "6": "Fernanda’s former spiritual director explained to her in a letter that he had been \nborn two months before and that they had taken the pri vilege of baptizing him \nAureliano, for his grandfather, because his mother woul d not open her lips to tell \nthem her wishes. Fernanda rose up inside against that t rick of fate, but she had \nsufficient strength to hide it in front of the nun. \n“We’ll tell them that we found him floating in the basket,” she said smiling. \n“No one will believe it,” the nun said. \n“If they believe it in the Bible,” Fernanda replied,  “I don’t see why they \nshouldn’t believe it from me.” \nThe nun lunched at the house while she waited for the  train back, and in \naccordance with the discretion they asked of her, she did n ot mention the child \nagain, but Fernanda viewed her as an undesirable wit ness of her shame and \nlamented the fact that they had abandoned the medieva l custom of hanging a \nmessenger who bore bad news. It was then that she decided  to drown the child in \nthe cistern as soon as the nun left, but her heart was no t strong enough and she \npreferred to wait patiently until the infinite good ness of God would free her from \nthe annoyance. \nThe new Aureliano was a year old when the tension of t he people broke with \nno forewarning. José Arcadio Segundo and other union l eaders who had \nremained underground until then suddenly appeared on e weekend and organized \ndemonstrations in towns throughout the banana region.  The police merely \nmaintained public order. But on Monday night the lea ders were taken from their \nhomes and sent to jail in the capital of the province wi th two-pound irons on their \nlegs. Taken among them were José Arcadio Segundo and Lor enzo Gavilán, a \ncolonel in the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, wh o said that he had been \nwitness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz. Th ey were set free, \nhowever, within three months because of the fact that the government and the \nbanana company could not reach an agreement as to who sho uld feed them in",
            "7": "jail. The protests of the workers this time were based on  the lack of sanitary \nfacilities in their living quarters, the nonexistence of medical services, and terrible \nworking conditions. They stated, furthermore, that they w ere not being paid in real \nmoney but in scrip, which was good only to buy Virginia h am in the company \ncommissaries. José Arcadio Segundo was put in jail because he  r ev e a l e d  th a t  \nthe scrip system was a way for the company to finance its frui t ships; which \nwithout the commissary merchandise would have to return  empty from New \nOrleans to the banana ports. The other complaints were common knowledge. \nThe company physicians did not examine the sick but had t hem line up behind \none another in the dispensaries and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper \nsulfate on their tongues, whether they had malaria, go norrhea, or constipation. It \nwas a cure that was so common that children would stand in  line several times \nand instead of swallowing the pills would take them hom e to use as bingo \nmarkers. The company workers were crowded together in miser able barracks. \nThe engineers, instead of putting in toilets, had a po rtable latrine for every fifty \npeople brought to the camps at Christmas time and they h eld public \ndemonstrations of how to use them so that they would la st longer. The decrepit \nlawyers dressed in black who during other times had besi eged Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía and who now were controlled by the banana comp any dismissed those \ndemands with decisions that seemed like acts of magic. When  the workers drew \nup a list of unanimous petitions, a long time passed bef ore they were able to \nnotify the banana company officially. As soon as he found o ut about the \nagreement Mr. Brown hitched his luxurious glassed-in coa ch to the train and \ndisappeared from Macondo along with the more prominen t representatives of his \ncompany. Nonetheless some workers found one of them the fo llowing Saturday \nin a brothel and they made him sign a copy of the sheet  with the demands while \nhe was naked with the women who had helped to entrap him. The mournful \nlawyers showed in court that that man had nothing to do  with the company and in",
            "8": "order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an impostor. Later \non, Mr. Brown was surprised traveling incognito, in a t hird-class coach and they \nmade him sign another copy of the demands. On the foll owing day he appeared \nbefore the judges with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish. The \nlawyers showed that the man was not Mr. Jack Brown, the sup erintendent of the \nbanana company, born in Prattville Alabama, but a har mless vendor of medicinal \nplants, born in Macondo and baptized there with the n ame of Dagoberto \nFonseca. A while later, faced with a new attempt by t he workers the lawyers \npublicly exhibited Mr. Brown’s death certificate, atteste d to by consuls and foreign \nministers which bore witness that on June ninth last he  had been run over by a \nfire engine in Chicago. Tired of that hermeneutical d elirium, the workers turned \naway from the authorities in Macondo and brought their  complaints up to the \nhigher courts. It was there that the sleight-of-hand la wyers proved that the \ndemands lacked all validity for the simple reason that th e banana company did \nnot have, never had had, and never would have any wo rkers in its service \nbecause they were all hired on a temporary and occasional  basis. So that the \nfable of the Virginia ham was nonsense, the same as tha t of the miraculous pills \nand the Yuletide toilets, and by a decision of the cour t it was established and set \ndown in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist. \nThe great strike broke out. Cultivation stopped halfway,  the fruit rotted on the \ntrees and the hundred-twenty-car trains remained on the  sidings. The idle \nworkers overflowed the towns. The Street of the Turks ec hoed with a Saturday \nthat lasted for several days and in the poolroom at the  Hotel Jacob they had to \narrange twenty-four-hour shifts. That was where José Arcad io Segundo was on \nthe day it was announced that the army had been assigned  to reestablish public \norder. Although he was not a man given to omens, the n ews was like an \nannouncement of death that he had been waiting for e ver since that distant \nmorning when Colonel Gerineldo Márquez had let him see an execution. The bad",
            "9": "omen did not change his solemnity, however. He took the  sh ot h e h ad pl ann ed \nand it was good. A short time later the drumbeats, th e shrill of the bugle, the \nshouting and running of the people told him that not  only had the game of pool \ncome to an end, but also the silent and solitary game th at he had been playing \nwith himself ever since that dawn execution. Then he went out into the street and \nsaw them. There were three regiments, whose march in ti me to a galley drum \nmade the earth tremble. Their snorting of a many-hea ded dragon filled the glow \nof noon with a pestilential vapor. They were short, sto cky, and brutelike. They \nperspired with the sweat of a horse and had a smell of suntanned hide and the \ntaciturn and impenetrable perseverance of men from the uplands. Although it took \nthem over an hour to pass by, one might have thought t hat they were only a few \nsquads marching in a circle, because they were all ident ical, sons of the same \nbitch, and with the same stolidity they all bore the wei ght of their packs and \ncanteens, the shame of their rifles with fixed bayonets,  and the chancre of blind \nobedience and a sense of honor. Úrsula heard them pass  from  her bed in th e \nshadows and she made a crow with her fingers. Santa Sof ía de la Piedad existed \nfor an instant, leaning over the embroidered tablecl oth that she had just ironed, \nand she thought of her son, José Arcadio Segundo, who w ithout changing \nexpression watched the last soldiers pass by the door of the  Hotel Jacob. \nMartial law enabled the army to assume the functions o f arbitrator in the \ncontroversy, but no effort at conciliation was made. As soo n as they appeared in \nMacondo, the soldiers put aside their rifles and cut and  loaded the bananas and \nstarted the trains running. The workers, who had been co ntent to wait until then, \nwent into the woods with no other weapons but their w orking machetes and they \nbegan to sabotage the sabotage. They burned plantation s and commissaries, \ntore up tracks to impede the passage of the trains that b egan to open their path \nwith machine-gun fire, and they cut telegraph and te lephone wires. The irrigation \nditches were stained with blood. Mr. Brown, who was ali ve in the electrified",
            "10": "chicken coop, was taken out of Macondo with his family and t hose of his fellow \ncountrymen and brought to a safe place under the protect ion of the army. The \nsituation was threatening to lead to a bloody and uneq ual civil war when the \nauthorities called upon the workers to gather in Macondo . The summons \nannounced that the civil and military leader of the p rovince would arrive on the \nfollowing Friday ready to intercede in the conflict. \nJosé Arcadio Segundo was in the crowd that had gathered at the station on \nFriday since early in the morning. He had taken part in a meeting of union leaders \nand had been commissioned, along with Colonel Gavilán , to mingle in the crowd \nand orient it according to how things went. He did not  feel well and a salty paste \nwas beginning to collect on his palate when he noticed t hat the army had set up \nmachine-gun emplacements around the small square and th at the wired city of \nthe banana company was protected by artillery pieces. Aroun d twelve o’clock, \nwaiting for a train that was not arriving, more than  three thousand people, \nworkers, women, and children, had spilled out of the o pen space in front of the \nstation and were pressing into the neighboring streets, which the army had closed \noff with rows of machine guns. At that time it all seem ed more like a jubilant fair \nthan a waiting crowd. They had brought over the fritte r and drink stands from the \nStreet of the Turks and the people were in good spirit s as they bore the tedium of \nwaiting and the scorching sun. A short time before th ree o’clock the rumor spread \nthat the official train would not arrive until the f ollowing day. The crowd let out a \nsigh of disappointment. An army lieutenant then climbe d up onto the roof of the \nstation where there were four machine-gun emplacemen ts aiming at the crowd \nand called for silence. Next to José Arcadio Segundo ther e was a barefooted \nwoman, very fat, with two children between the ages of  four and seven. She was \ncarrying the smaller one and she asked José Arcadio Segundo , without knowing \nhim, if he would lift up the other one so that he cou ld hear better. José Arcadio \nSegundo put the child on his shoulders. Many years later  that child would still tell,",
            "11": "to the disbelief of all, that he had seen the lieuten ant reading Decree No.",
            "12": "of the \ncivil and military leader of the province through an old  ph on ograph  horn . It h ad \nbeen signed by General Carlos Cortes Vargas and his secr etary, Major Enrique \nGarcía Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words he de clared the strikers to be a \n“bunch of hoodlums” and he authorized the army to shoo t to kill. \nAfter the decree was read, in the midst of a deafening  hoot of protest, a \ncaptain took the place of the lieutenant on the roof o f the station and with the horn \nhe signaled that he wanted to speak. The crowd was quie t again. \n“Ladies and gentlemen,” the captain said in a low voice that was slow and a \nlittle tired. “you have five minutes to withdraw.” \nThe redoubled hooting and shouting drowned out the bugle call that \nannounced the start of the count. No one moved. \nFive minutes have passed,” the captain said in the same t one. “One more \nminute and we’ll open fire.” \nJosé Arcadio Segundo, sweating ice, lowered the child an d gave him to the \nwoman. “Those bastards might just shoot,” she murmured. José Arcadio \nSegundo did not have time to speak because at that insta nt he recognized the \nhoarse voice of Colonel Gavilán echoing the words of th e woman with a shout. \nIntoxicated by the tension, by the miraculous depth of th e silence, and \nfurthermore convinced that nothing could move that cro wd held tight in a \nfascination with death, José Arcadio Segundo raised himsel f up over the heads in \nfront of him and for the first time in his life he ra ised his voice. \n“You bastards!” he shouted. “Take the extra minute and stick it up your ass!” \nAfter his shout something happened that did not bring on fright but a kind of \nhallucination. The captain gave the order to fire an d fourteen machine guns \nanswered at once. But it all seemed like a farce. It was  as if the machine guns \nhad been loaded with caps, because their panting rattle  could be heard and their \nincandescent spitting could be seen, but not the slightest  reaction was perceived,",
            "13": "not a cry, not even a sigh among the compact crowd that s eemed petrified by an \ninstantaneous invulnerability. Suddenly, on one side-of t he station, a cry of death \ntore open the enchantment: “Aaaagh, Mother.” A seismi c voice, a volcanic breath. \nthe roar of a cataclysm broke out in the center of the cr owd with a great potential \nof expansion. José Arcadio Segundo barely had time to pick up the child while \nthe mother with the other one was swallowed up by the crowd that swirled about \nin panic. \nMany years later that child would still tell, in spite of  people thinking that he \nwas a crazy old man, how José Arcadio Segundo had lifted him over his head \nand hauled him, almost in the air, as if floating on the terror of the crowd, toward \na nearby street. The child’s privileged position allow ed him to see at that moment \nthat the wild mass was starting to get to the corner and  the row of machine guns \nopened fire. Several voices shouted at the same time: \n“Get down! Get down!” \nThe people in front had already done so, swept down by the wave of bullets. \nThe survivors, instead of getting down, tried to go ba ck to the small square, and \nthe panic became a dragon’s tail as one compact wave ran against another which \nwas moving in the opposite direction, toward the other  dragon’s tail In the street \nacross the way, where the machine guns were also firing w ithout cease. They \nwere Penned in. swirling about in a gigantic whirlwi nd that little by little was being \nreduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically bei ng cut off all around \nlike an onion being peeled by the insatiable and metho dical shears of the \nmachine guns. The child saw a woman kneeling with her  arms in the shape of a \ncross in an open space, mysteriously free of the stampede. José  Arcadio \nSegundo put him up there at the moment he fell with  his face bathed in blood, \nbefore the colossal troop wiped out the empty space, the kneeling woman, the \nlight of the high, drought-stricken sky, and the whorish world where Úrsula \nIguarán had sold so many little candy animals.",
            "14": "When José Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness. \nHe realized that he was riding on an endless and silent  train and that his head \nwas caked with dry blood and that all his bones ached. He  f e l t  an  i n t o l e r a b l e \ndesire to sleep. Prepared to sleep for many hours, safe f rom the terror and the \nhorror, he made himself comfortable on the side that p ained him less, and only \nthen did he discover that he was lying against dead peop le. There was no free \nspace in the car except for an aisle in the middle. Seve ral hours must have \npassed since the massacre because the corpses had the same tempe rature as a \nplaster in autumn and the same consistency of petrified f oam that it had, and \nthose who had put them in the car had had time to pil e them up in the same way \nin which they transported bunches of bananas. Trying to  flee from the nightmare, \nJosé Arcadio Segundo dragged himself from one car to an other in the direction \nin which the train was heading, and in the flashes of  light that broke through the \nwooden slats as they went through sleeping towns he saw th e man corpses, \nwoman corpses, child corpses who would be thrown into the  sea like rejected \nbananas. He recognized only a woman who sold drinks in th e square and Colonel \nGavilán, who still held wrapped in his hand the belt with a buckle of Morelia silver \nwith which he had tried to open his way through the p anic. When he got to the \nfirst car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the t racks until the train had \npassed. It was the longest one he had ever seen, with al most two hundred freight \ncars and a locomotive at either end and a third one in  the middle. It had no lights, \nnot even the red and green running lights, and it sli pped off with a nocturnal and \nstealthy velocity. On top of the cars there could be seen  the dark shapes of the \nsoldiers with their emplaced machine guns. \nAfter midnight a torrential cloudburst came up. José Ar cadio Segundo did \nnot know where it was that he had jumped off, but he  knew that by going in the \nopposite direction to that of the train he would reac h Macondo. After walking for \nmore than three hours, soaked to the skin, with a terrib le headache, he was able",

Att racted by the smell of coffee, \nhe went into a kitchen where a woman with a child in  her arms was leaning over \nthe stove. \n“Hello,” he said, exhausted. “I’m José Arcadio Segundo Bu endía.” \nHe pronounced his whole name, letter by letter, in ord er to convince her that \nhe was alive. He was wise in doing so, because the woman had thought that he \nwas an apparition as she saw the dirty, shadowy figure wi th his head and clothing \ndirty with blood and touched with the solemnity of dea th come through the door. \nShe recognized him. She brought him a blanket so that h e could wrap himself up \nwhile his clothes dried by the fire, she warmed some wate r to wash his wound, \nwhich was only a flesh wound, and she gave him a clean  di aper to ban dage h i s \nhead. Then she gave him a mug of coffee without suga r as she had been told the \nBuendías drank it, and she spread his clothing out near the fire. \nJosé Arcadio Segundo did not speak until he had finishe d drinking his \ncoffee. \n“There must have been three thousand of them” he mur mured. \n“What?” \n“The dead,” he clarified. “It must have been an of th e people who were at the \nstation.” \nThe woman measured him with a pitying look. “There ha ven’t been any dead \nhere,” she said. “Since the time of your uncle, the col onel, nothing has happened \nin Macondo.” In the three kitchens where José Arcadio Seg undo stopped before \nreaching home they told him the same thing. “There we ren’t any dead.

On their marginal street the \nWest Indian Negroes were singing Saturday psalms. José Arca dio Segundo \njumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house t hrough the kitchen. Santa \nSofía de la Piedad barely raised her voice. “Don’t le t Fernanda see you,” she \nsaid. “She’s just getting up.” As if she were fulfilling  an implicit pact, she took her \nson to the “chamberpot room.” arranged Melquíades’ br oken-down cot for him \nand at two in the afternoon, while Fernanda was takin g her siesta, she passed a \nplate of food in to him through the window. \nAureliano Segundo had slept at home because the rain had caught him time \nand at three in the afternoon he was still waiting fo r it to clear. Informed in secret \nby Santa Sofía de la Piedad, he visited his brother in Melquíades’ room at that \ntime. He did not believe the version of the massacre or  the nightmare trip of the \ntrain loaded with corpses traveling toward the sea eit her. The night before he had \nread an extraordinary proclamation to the nation whic h said that the workers had \nleft the station and had returned home in peaceful gr oups. The proclamation also \nstated that the union leaders, with great patriotic spi rit, had reduced their \ndemands to two points: a reform of medical services and t he building of latrines in \nthe living quarters. It was stated later that when the military authorities obtained \nthe agreement with the workers, they hastened to tell M r. Brown and he not only \naccepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three  days of public festivities \nto celebrate the end of the conflict. Except that when the military asked him on \nwhat date they could announce the signing of the agree ment, he looked out the \nwindow at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and made a profound gesture of \ndoubt.",

But when \nMr. Brown announced his decision a torrential downpour  spread over the whole \nbanana region. It was the one that caught José Arcadio S egundo on his way to \nMacondo. A week later it was still raining. The official  version, repeated a \nthousand times and mangled out all over the country by e very means of \ncommunication the government found at hand, was finall y accepted: there were \nno dead, the satisfied workers had gone back to their fam ilies, and the banana \ncompany was suspending all activity until the rains stopped.  Martial law continued \nwith an eye to the necessity of taking emergency measures fo r the public disaster \nof the endless downpour, but the troops were confined t o quarters. During the \nday the soldiers walked through the torrents in the stree ts with their pant legs \nrolled up, playing with boats with the children.

One February night the \nunmistakable blows of rifle butts were heard at the doo r. Aureliano Segundo, who \nwas still waiting for it to clear, opened the door to six soldiers under the command \nof an officer.

Santa Sofía de la Piedad managed to \nwarn José Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquíade s’ room, but he \ncould see that it was too late to try to escape. So Santa  Sofía de la Piedad locked \nthe door again and he put on his shirt and his shoes a nd sat down on the cot to \nwait for them. At that moment they were searching the  gold workshop. The officer \nmade them open the padlock and with a quick sweep of his lantern he saw the \nworkbench and the glass cupboard with bottles of acid an d instruments that were \nstill where their owner had left them and he seemed t o understand that no one \nlived in that room. He wisely asked Aureliano Segundo i f he was a silversmith, \nhowever, and the latter explained to him that it had  b e e n  C o l o n e l  A u r e l i a n o  \nBuendía’s workshop. “Oho,” the officer said, turned on t he lights, and ordered \nsuch a minute search that they did not miss the eighteen  little gold fishes that had \nnot been melted down and that were hidden behind th e bottles Is their tin can. \nThe officer examined them one by one on the workbench and then he turned \nhuman. “I’d like to take one, if I may,” he said. “At o ne time they were a mark of \nsubversion, but now they’re relics.” He was young, almost an adolescent, with no \nsign of timidity and with a natural pleasant manner th at had not shown itself until \nthen. Aureliano Segundo gave him the little fish. T he officer put it in his shirt \npocket with a childlike glow in his eyes and he put the o thers back in the can and \nset it back where it had been. \n“It’s a wonderful memento,” he said. “Colonel Aurelia no Buendía was one of \nour greatest men.” \nNevertheless, that surge of humanity did not alter his  professional conduct. \nAt Melquíades’ room, which was locked up again with the  padlock, Santa Sofía \nde la Piedad tried one last hope. “No one has lived i n that room for a century,” \nshe said. The officer had it opened and flashed the be am of the lantern over it, \nand Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofía de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of José",

But the officer continued examining the \nroom with the lantern and showed no sign of interest until he discovered the \nseventy-two chamberpots piled up in the cupboards. Then he turned on the light. \nJosé Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot, ready to go, more \nsolemn and pensive than ever. In the background were the  shelves with the \nshredded books, the rolls of parchment, and the clean an d orderly worktable with \nthe ink still fresh in the inkwells. There was the same pu reness in the air, the \nsame clarity, the same respite from dust and destruction th at Aureliano Segundo \nhad known in childhood and that only Colonel Aurelia no Buendía could not \nperceive. But the officer was only interested in the cham berpots. \n“How many people live in this house?’ he asked. \n“Five.” \nThe officer obviously did not understand. He paused wit h his glance on the \nspace where Aureliano Segundo and Santa Soft de la Pi edad were still seeing \nJosé Arcadio Segundo and the latter also realized that the soldier was looking at \nhim without seeing him. Then he turned out the light  and closed the door. When \nhe spoke to the soldiers, Aureliano, Segundo understood that the young officer \nhad seen the room with the same eyes as Colonel Aurelian o Buendía. \n“It’s obvious that no one has been in that room for at  least a hundred years.” \nthe officer said to the soldiers. “There must even be sna kes in there.” \nWhen the door closed, José Arcadio Segundo was sure that t he war was \nover. Years before Colonel Aureliano Buendía had spoke n to him about the \nfascination of war and had tried to show it to him wi th countless examples drawn \nfrom his own experience. He had believed him.

            "21": "dead people, José Arcadio Segundo reached the conclusio n that Colonel \nAureliano Buendía was nothing but a faker or an imbeci le. He could not \nunderstand why he had needed so many words to explain wh at he felt in war \nbecause one was enough: fear. In Melquíades’ room, on  t h e  o t h e r  h a n d ,  \nprotected by the supernatural light, by the sound of th e rain, by the feeling of \nbeing invisible, he found the repose that he had not  had for one single instant \nduring his previous life, and the only fear that rem ained was that they would bury \nhim alive. He told Santa Sofía de la Piedad about i t when she brought him his \ndaily meals and she promised to struggle to stay alive eve n beyond her natural \nforces in order to make sure that they would bury him dea d. Free from all fear, \nJosé Arcadio Segundo dedicated himself then to peruse the  manuscripts of \nMelquíades many times, and with so much more pleasure when he could not \nunderstand them. He became accustomed to the sound of th e rain, which after \ntwo months had become another form of silence, and the only thing that disturbed \nhis solitude was the coming and going of Santa Sofía de  la Piedad. He asked her, \ntherefore, to leave the meals on the windowsill and p adlock the door. The rest of \nthe family forgot about him including Fernanda, who d id not mind leaving him \nthere when she found that the soldiers had seen him wi thout recognizing him. \nAfter six months of enclosure, since the soldiers had lef t Macondo Aureliano \nSegundo removed the padlock, looking for someone he coul d talk to until the rain \nstopped.

José Arcadio Segundo, devoured by baldness, i ndifferent to the air \nthat had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors, was st ill reading and \nrereading the unintelligible parchments. He was illumi nated by a seraphic glow. \nHe scarcely raised his eyes when he heard the door open, b ut that look was \nenough for his brother to see repeated in it the irre parable fate of his great-\ngrandfather.",

T here were \nperiods of drizzle during which everyone put on his full  dress and a convalescent \nlook to celebrate the clearing, but the people soon gr ew accustomed to interpret \nthe pauses as a sign of redoubled rain. The sky crumbled in to a set of destructive \nstorms and out of the north came hurricanes that scattered  r o o f s  a b o u t  a n d  \nknocked down walls and uprooted every last plant of the ba nana groves. Just as \nduring the insomnia plague, as Úrsula came to remember during those days, the \ncalamity itself inspired defenses against boredom. Aurelia no Segundo was one of \nthose who worked hardest not to be conquered by idleness. He had gone home \nfor some minor matter on the night that Mr. Brown un leashed the storm, and \nFernanda tried to help him with a half-blown-out um brella that she found in a \ncloset. “I don’t need it,” he said. “I’ll stay until it clears.” That was not, of course, \nan ironclad promise, but he would accomplish it litera lly. Since his clothes were at \nPetra Cotes’s, every three days he would take off what h e had on and wait in his \nshorts until they washed. In order not to become bored,  he dedicated himself to \nthe task of repairing the many things that needed fixing  in the house.

The worst part was that the rain  was affecting everything \nand the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if \nthey were not oiled every three days, and the threads in  brocades rusted, and wet \nclothing would break out in a rash of saffron-colored mo ss. The air was so damp \nthat fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows, \nfloating through the atmosphere in the rooms. One mor ning Úrsula woke up \nfeeling that she was reaching her end in a placid swoon and she had already \nasked them to take her to Father Antonio Isabel, even i f it had to be on a \nstretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad discovered tha t her back was paved \nwith leeches. She took them off one by one, crushing th em with a firebrand \nbefore they bled her to death. It was necessary to dig ca nals to get the water out \nof the house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that  they could dry the floors and \ntake the bricks from under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied \nwith the many small details that called for his attenti on, Aureliano Segundo did \nnot realize that he was getting old until one aftern oon when he found himself \ncontemplating the premature dusk from a rocking chair an d thinking about Petra \nCotes without quivering. There would have been no pr oblem in going back to \nFernanda’s insipid love, because her beauty had become sol emn with age, but \nthe rain had spared him from all emergencies of passion and had filled him with \nthe spongy serenity of a lack of appetite.

He had been one of the first to bring z inc sheets to Macondo, much \nearlier than their popularization by the banana compa ny, simply to roof Petra \nCotes’s bedroom with them and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intimacy \nthat the sprinkling of the rain produced at that time.

It was during those days that in a \nmoment of carelessness little Aureliano appeared on th e porch and his \ngrandfather recognized the secret of his identity. He c ut his hair, dressed him \ntaught him not to be afraid of people, and very soon  it was evident that he was a \nlegitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his high cheekbone s, his startled look, and his \nsolitary air.

During the first months of the rain s he was afraid that he would \ntry to slip into her bedroom and that she would have to undergo the shame of \nrevealing to him that she was incapable of reconciliatio n since the birth of \nAmaranta Úrsula. That was the reason for her anxious cor respondence with the \ninvisible doctors, interrupted by frequent disasters of th e mail. During the first \nmonths when it was learned that the trains were jumpin g their tracks in the rain, a \nletter from the invisible doctors told her that hers w ere not arriving. Later on, \nwhen contact with the unknown correspondents was broken, s he had seriously \nthought of putting on the tiger mask that her husband had worn in the bloody \ncarnival and having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana \ncompany doctors. But one of the many people who regularl y brought unpleasant \nnews of the deluge had told her that the company was di smantling its \ndispensaries to move them to where it was not raining. Then she gave up hope. \nShe resigned herself to waiting until the rain stopped  and the mail service was \nback to normal, and in the meantime she sought relief from her secret ailments \nwith recourse to her imagination, because she would ra ther have died than put \nherself in the hands of the only doctor left in Macondo,  t h e  e x t r a v a g a n t  \nFrenchman who ate grass like a donkey. She drew close to Ú rsula, trusting that \nshe would know of some palliative for her attacks. But h er twisted habit of not \ncalling things by their names made her put first things l ast and use “expelled” for \n“gave birth” and “burning” for “flow” so that it wou ld all be less shameful, with the \nresult that Úrsula reached the reasonable conclusion th at her trouble was \nintestinal rather than uterine, and she advised her to take a dose of calomel on an \nempty stomach. If it had not been for that suffering, which would have had \nnothing shameful about it for someone who did not suff er as well from \nshamefulness, and if it had not been for the loss of the  letters, the rain would not \nhave bothered Fernanda, because, after all, her whole  life had been spent as if it",

He finally became \nworried about the state of his animals and he threw a n oilcloth over his head and \nsent to Petra Cotes’s house. He found her in the courtyar d, in the water up to her \nwaist, trying to float the corpse of a horse. Aureliano Segundo helped her with a \nlever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a  bell and was dragged \naway by the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain bega n, all that Petra Cotes had \ndone was to clear her courtyard of dead animals. During the first weeks she sent \nmessages to Aureliano Segundo for him to take urgent me asures and he had \nanswered that there was no rush, that the situation wa s not alarming, that there \nwould be plenty of time to think about something when it cleared. She sent him \nword that the horse pastures were being flooded, that the cattle were fleeing to \nhigh ground, where there was nothing to eat and wher e they were at the mercy of \njaguars and sickness. “There’s nothing to be done,” Aurel iano Segundo answered \nher. “Others will be born when it clears.” Petra Cates had seen them die in \ndusters and the was able to butcher only those stuck in the mud. She saw with \nquiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly extermina ting a fortune that at one \ntime was considered the largest and most solid in Macondo , and of which nothing \nremained but pestilence. When Aureliano Segundo decide d to go see what was",
            "6": "going on, he found only the corpse of the horse and a sq ualid mule in the ruins of \nthe stable. Petra Cotes watched him arrive without sur prise, joy, or resentment, \nand she only allowed herself an ironic smile. \n“It’s about time!” she said. \nShe had aged, all skin and bones, and her tapered eyes of a carnivorous \nanimal had become sad and tame from looking at the ra in so much. Aureliano \nSegundo stayed at her house more than three months, no t because he felt better \nthere than in that of his family, but because he needed  all that time to make the \ndecision to throw the piece of oilcloth back over his head . “There’s no rush,” he \nsaid, as he had said in the other home. “Let’s hope th at it clears in the next few \nhours.” During the course of the first week he became accu stomed to the inroads \nthat time and the rain had made in the health of hi s concubine, and little by little \nhe was seeing her as she had been before, remembering h er jubilant excesses \nand the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals, and partly through \nlove, partly through interest, one night during the se cond week he awoke her with \nurgent caresses. Petra Cotes did not react. “Go back to slee p,” she murmured. \n“These aren’t times for things like that.” Aureliano Se gundo saw himself in the \nmirrors on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes’s spinal column li ke a row of spools strung \ntogether along a cluster of withered nerves, and he saw  that she was right, not \nbecause of the times but because of themselves, who were n o longer up to those \nthings. \nAureliano Segundo returned home with his trunks, convince d that not only \nÚrsula but all the inhabitants of Macondo were waiting  for i t to dear i n  order to \ndie. He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in their p arlors with an absorbed \nlook and folded arms, feeling unbroken time pass, relent less times, because it \nwas useless to divide it into months and years, and the da ys into hours, when \none could do nothing but contemplate the rain. The ch ildren greeted Aureliano \nSegundo with excitement because he was playing the asthma tic accordion for",

But the concerts did not attract their atte ntion as much as the \nsessions with the encyclopedia, and once more they got tog ether in Meme’s \nroom, where Aureliano Segundo’s imagination changed a dirigible into a flying \nelephant who was looking for a place to sleep among the  clouds. On one \noccasion he came across a man on horseback who in spite of hi s strange outfit \nhad a familiar look, and after examining him closely h e came to the conclusion \nthat it was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. H e showed it to Fernanda and \nshe also admitted the resemblance of the horseman not on ly to the colonel but to \neverybody in the family, although he was actually a Tart ar warrior. Time passed \nin that way with the Colossus of Rhodes and snake charmer s until his wife told \nhim that there were only three pounds of dried meat a nd a sack of rice left in the \npantry. \nAnd what do you want me to do about it?” he asked. \n“I don’t know,” Fernanda answered. “That’s men’s business. ” \n“Well,” Aureliano Segundo said, “something will be do ne when it clears.” \nHe was more interested in the encyclopedia than In the domestic problem, \neven when he had to content himself with a scrap of mea t and a little rice for \nlunch. “It’s impossible to do anything now,” he would sa y. “It can’t rain for the rest \nof our lives.” And while the urgencies of the pantry gr ew greater, Fernanda’s \nindignation also grew, until her eventual protests, he r infrequent outbursts came \nforth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that begi n one morning like the \nmonotonous drone of a guitar and as the day advanced rose  in pitch, richer and \nmore splendid.

He stood up  unhurriedly, as if he only \nintended to stretch, and with a perfectly regulated and  methodical fury he \ngrabbed the pots with the begonias one after the othe r, those with the ferns, the \noregano, and one after the  other he smashed them o nto the floor.

It was in that way that Aureliano Segundo rem embered the fortune \nburied in some place that only Úrsula knew, but the que stions and astute \nmaneuvering that occurred to him were of no use because  in the labyrinth of her \nmadness she seemed to preserve enough of a margin of l ucidity to keep the \nsecret which she would reveal only to the one who could  prove that he was the \nreal owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and  strict that when Aureliano \nSegundo instructed one of his carousing companions to pass himself off as the \nowner of the fortune, she got him all caught up in a  minute interrogation sown \nwith subtle traps. \nConvinced that Úrsula would carry the secret to her gra ve, Aureliano \nSegundo hired a crew of diggers under the pretext tha t they were making some \ndrainage canals in the courtyard and the backyard, and he himself took \nsoundings in the earth with iron bars and all manner o f metal-detectors without \nfinding anything that resembled gold in three months o f exhaustive exploration. \nLater on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hope tha t the cards would we more \nthan the diggers, but she began by explaining that a ny attempt would be useless \nunless Úrsula cut the cards. On the other hand, she conf irmed the existence of \nthe treasure with the precision of its consisting of seven thousand two hundred \nfourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire within a \ncircle with a radius of three hundred eighty-eight feet  with Úrsula’s bed as the \ncenter, but she warned that it would not be found un til it stopped raining and the \nsuns of three consecutive Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust.

Fernanda feared that he was as crazy as his twin brother when \nshe saw him taking the measurements, and even more when  h e tol d th e diggin g \ncrew to make the ditches three feet deeper. Overcome by a n exploratory delirium \ncomparable only to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the \nroute of inventions, Aureliano Segundo lost the last la yers of fat that he had left \nand the old resemblance to his twin brother was becoming  accentuated again, \nnot only because of his slim figure, but also because of  the distant air and the \nwithdrawn attitude. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, \nmuddled from head to toe, and he did so in a corner i n the kitchen, barely \nanswering the occasional questions asked by Santa Sofía de l a Piedad. Seeing \nhim work that way, as she had never dreamed him capable  of doi ng, Fern an da \nthought that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed a bnegation, and his thick-\nheadedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remorse over the \nvirulence with which she had attacked his idleness. But A ureliano Segundo was \nin no mood for merciful reconciliations at that time. S unk up to his neck in a \nmorass of dead brandies and rotting flowers, he flung t he dirt of the garden all \nabout after having finished with the courtyard and th e backyard, and he \nexcavated so deeply under the foundations of the east wi ng of the house that one \nnight they woke up in terror at what seemed to be an earthquake, as much \nbecause of the trembling as the fearful underground cr eaking. Three of the rooms \nwere collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up fr om the porch to \nFernanda’s room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up th e search because of that. \nEven when his last hopes had been extinguished and the  only thing that seemed \nto make any sense was what the cards had predicted, he rei nforced the jagged \nfoundation, repaired the crack with mortar, and continu ed on the side to the west. \nHe was still there on the second week of the following J une when the rain began \nto abate and the clouds began to lift and it was obvio us from one moment to the \nnext that it was going to clear. That was what happene d. On Friday at two in the",
            "15": "afternoon the world lighted up with a crazy crimson sun  as harsh as brick dust \nand almost as cool as water, and it did not rain again for ten years. \nMacondo was in ruins. In the swampy streets there were the  remains of \nfurniture, animal skeletons covered with red lilies, the  last memories of the hordes \nof newcomers who had fled Macondo as wildly as they had ar rived. The houses \nthat had been built with such haste during the banan a fever had been \nabandoned. The banana company tore down its installati ons. All that remained of \nthe former wired-in city were the ruins. The wooden ho uses, the cool terraces for \nbreezy card-playing afternoons, seemed to have been blo wn away in an \nanticipation of the prophetic wind that years later wo uld wipe Macondo off the \nface of the earth. The only human trace left by that vo racious blast was a glove \nbelonging to Patricia Brown in an automobile smother ed in wild pansies. The \nenchanted region explored by José Arcadio Buendía in the  days of the founding, \nwhere later on the banana plantations flourished, wa s a bog of rotting roots, on \nthe horizon of which one could manage to see the silent  foam of the sea. \nAureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction on the first Sunday that he \nput on dry clothes and went out to renew his acquaintan ce with the town.

Their \nstrength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming t ables, the fritter stands, the \nshooting galleries, and the alley where they interpret ed dreams and predicted the \nfuture made Aureliano Segundo ask them with his usual informality what \nmysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to have g one awash in the \nstorm, what the devil they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, \nfrom door to door, they returned a crafty smile and a d reamy look, and without \nany previous consultation they all gave the answer:  \n“Swimming.” \nPetra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had an Arab  heart.

At that time she \nhad dug deep into her heart, searching for the strengt h that would allow her to \nsurvive the misfortune, and she had discovered a reflect ive and just rage with \nwhich she had sworn to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and then \nwiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decis ion that Aureliano \nSegundo went back to her house eight months after the l ast message and found \nher green disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin spangle d with mange, but she \nwas writing out numbers on small pieces of paper to ma ke a raffle. Aureliano \nSegundo was astonished, and he was so dirty and so solemn that Petra Cotes",

Its skin was clinging to its bones like that of its mi stress, but it was just as \nalive and resolute as she. Petra Cotes had fed it with  her wrath, and when there \nwas no more hay or corn or roots, she had given it she lter in her own bedroom \nand fed it on the percale sheets, the Persian rugs, the  plush bedspreads, the \nvelvet drapes, and the canopy embroidered with gold th read and silk tassels on \nthe episcopal bed."

The waves of lucidity that were so scarce during the rains became more \nfrequent after August, when an and wind began to blo w and suffocated the rose \nbushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up sca ttering over Macondo the \nburning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the  age-old almond trees \nforever. Úrsula cried in lamentation when she discover ed that for more than three \nyears she had been a plaything for the children. She wa shed her painted face, \ntook off the strips of brightly colored cloth, the drie d lizards and frogs, and the \nrosaries and old Arab necklaces that they had hung all ov er her body, and for the \nfirst time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without anybody’s \nhelp to join in the family life once more. The spirit of her invincible heart guided \nher through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumblin g and who bumped into \nthe archangelic arm she kept raised at head level thou ght that she was having \ntrouble with her body, but they still did not think she  was blind. She did not need \nto see to realize that the flower beds, cultivated wit h such care since the first \nrebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and ruined by Aureliano Segundo’s \nexcavations, and that the walls and the cement of the f loors were cracked, the \nfurniture mushy and discolored, the doors off their hin ges, and the family \nmenaced by a spirit of resignation and despair that was inconceivable in her time. \nFeeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she p erceived the continuous \nrumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the sni pping of the moths in the \nclothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormou s red ants that had \nprospered during the deluge and were undermining the  foundations of the house. \nOne day she opened the trunk with the saints and had to  ask Santa Sofía de la \nPiedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped  out and that had already",
            "1": "turned the clothing to dust. “A person can’t live in n eglect like this,” she said. “If \nwe go on like this we’ll be devoured by animals.” From then on she did not have a \nmoment of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the \nchildren. She put the few articles of clothing that wer e still usable out into the sun, \nshe drove the cockroaches off with powerful insecticide att acks, she scratched \nout the veins that the termites had made on doors and windows and asphyxiated \nthe ants in their anthills with quicklime. The fever of  restoration finally brought her \nto the forgotten rooms. She cleared out the rubble an d cobwebs in the room \nwhere José Arcadio Buendía had lost his wits looking for the Philosopher’s stone, \nshe put the silver shop which had been upset by the sold iers in order, and lastly \nshe asked for the keys to Melquíades’ room to see what state  it was in. Faithful to \nthe wishes of José Arcadio Segundo, who had forbidden a nyone to come in \nunless there was a clear indication that he had died, Sa nta Sofía de la Piedad \ntried all kinds of subterfuges to throw Úrsula off the track. But so inflexible was \nher determination not to surrender even the most remo te corner of the house to \nthe insects that she knocked down every obstacle in her pat h, and after three \ndays of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the door for her. She \nhad to hold on to the doorjamb so that the stench wo uld not knock her over, but \nshe needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgi rls’ seventy-two \nchamberpots were in there and that on one of the rain y nights a patrol of soldiers \nhad searched the house looking for José Arcadio Segundo and had been unable \nto find him. \n“Lord save us!” she exclaimed, as if she could see ever ything. “So much \ntrouble teaching you good manners and you end up living  like a pig.” \nJosé Arcadio Segundo was still reading over the parchmen ts. The only thing \nvisible in the intricate tangle of hair was the teeth  striped with green dime and his \nmotionless eyes. When he recognized his great-grandmother’ s voice he turned",

But even then sh e did not give resignation a \nchance. She scolded José Arcadio Segundo as if he were a ch ild and insisted \nthat he take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixi ng up the house. The simple \nidea of abandoning the room that had given him peace  terrified José Arcadio \nSegundo.

He did not tell anyone. \nTormented by the fear of dying without having sent Ama ranta Úrsula to Brussels, \nhe worked as he had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly \nraffles. From very early in the morning he could be seen  going through the town, \neven in the most outlying and miserable sections, trying t o sell tickets with an \nanxiety that could only be conceivable in a dying man. “ Here’s Divine \nProvidence,” he hawked. “Don’t let it get away, because i t only comes every \nhundred years.” He made pitiful efforts to appear gay,  pleasant, talkative, but it",
            "17": "was enough to see his sweat and paleness to know that h is heart was not in it. \nSometimes he would go to vacant lots, where no one coul d see him, and sit down \nto rest from the claws that were tearing him apart ins ide. Even at midnight he \nwould be in the red-light district trying to console wit h predictions of good luck the \nlonely women who were weeping beside their phonograph s. “This number hasn’t \ncome up in four months,” he told them, showing them t he tickets. “Don’t let it get \naway, life is shorter than you think.” They finally lost r espect for him, made fun of \nhim, and in his last months they no longer called him D on Aureliano, as they had \nalways done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence ri ght to his face. His \nvoice was becoming filled with wrong notes. It was getti ng out of tune, and it \nfinally diminished into the growl of a dog, but he st ill had the drive to see that \nthere should be no diminishing of the hope people br ought to Petra Cates’s \ncourtyard. As he lost his voice, however, and realized th at in a short time he \nwould be unable to bear the pain, he began to under stand that it was not through \nraffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived \nthe idea of organizing the fabulous raffle of the lan ds destroyed by the deluge, \nwhich could easily be restored by a person with the money to do so. It was such a \nspectacular undertaking that the mayor himself lent his ai d by announcing it in a \nproclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at  one hundred pesos \napiece and they were sold out in less than a week. The ni ght of the raffle the \nwinners held a huge celebration, comparable only to tho se of the good days of \nthe banana company, and Aureliano Segundo, for the la st time, played the \nforgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but  he could no longer \nsing them. \nTwo months later Amaranta Úrsula went to Brussels. Aurel iano Segundo \ngave her not only the money from the special raffle, b ut also what he had \nmanaged to put aside over the previous months and wha t little he had received \nfrom the sale of the pianola, the clavichord, and othe r junk that had fallen into",
            "18": "disrepair.  According to his calculations, that sum would  b e  e n o u g h  f o r  h e r  \nstudies, so that all that was lacking was the price of her fare back home. \nFernanda was against the trip until the last moment, sca ndalized by the idea that \nBrussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she calm ed down with the \nletter that Father Angel gave her addressed to a boar dinghouse run by nuns for \nCatholic young ladies where Amaranta Úrsula promised t o stay until her studies \nwere completed. Furthermore, the parish priest arrang ed for her to travel under \nthe care of a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to  Tol edo, where th ey \nhoped to find dependable people to accompany her to Be lgium. While the urgent \ncorrespondence that made the coordination possible went forward, Aureliano \nSegundo, aided by Petra Cates, prepared Amaranta Úrsu la’s baggage. The night \non which they were packing one of Fernanda’s bridal tr unks, the things were so \nwell organized that the schoolgirl knew by heart whic h were the suits and cloth \nslippers she could wear crossing the Atlantic and the blue  cloth coat with copper \nbuttons and the cordovan shoes she would wear when she  landed. She also \nknew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, \nthat at no time was she to leave the company of the nun s or leave her cabin \nexcept to eat, and that for no reason was she to answer  the questions asked by \npeople of any sex while they were at sea. She carried a small bottle with drops for \nseasickness and a notebook written by Father Angel in his o wn hand containing \nsix prayers to be used against storms. Fernanda made her a  canvas belt to keep \nher money in, and she would not have to take it off e ven to sleep. She tried to \ngive her the chamberpot, washed out with lye and dis infected with alcohol, but \nAmaranta Úrsula refused it for fear that her schoolma tes would make fun of her. \nA few months later, at the hour of his death, Aurelia no Segundo would remember \nher as he had seen her for the last time as she tried u nsuccessfully to lower the \nwindow of the second-class coach to hear Fernanda’s last pi ece of advice. She \nwas wearing a pink silk dress with a corsage of artificial p ansies pinned to her left",
            "19": "shoulder, her cordovan shoes with buckles and low heels, and sateen stockings \nheld up at the thighs with elastic garters. Her body wa s slim, her hair loose and \nlong, and she had the lively eyes that Úrsula had had at her age and the way in \nwhich she said good-bye, without crying but without smil ing either, revealed the \nsame strength of character. Walking beside the coach as it  picked up speed and \nholding Fernanda by the arm so that she would not stu mble, Aureliano scarcely \nhad time to wave at his daughter as she threw him a kiss with the tips of her \nfingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching s un, looking at the train \nas it merged with the black strip of the horizon, linkin g arms for the first time since \nthe day of their wedding. \nOn the ninth of August, before they received the first l etter from Brussels, \nJosé Arcadio Segundo was speaking to Aureliano in Melquía des’ room and, \nwithout realizing it, he said: \n“Always remember that they were more than three thousan d and that they \nwere thrown into the sea.” \nThen he fell back on the parchments and died with his eye s open. At that \nsame instant, in Fernanda’s bed, his twin brother came t o the end of the \nprolonged and terrible martyrdom of the steel crabs tha t were eating his throat \naway. One week previously he had returned home, without  any voice, unable to \nbreathe, and almost skin and bones, with his wandering t runks and his wastrel’s \naccordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wi fe. Petra Cotes helped him \npack his clothes and bade him farewell without shedding  a tear, but she forgot to \ngive him the patent leather shoes that he wanted to  wear in his coffin. So when \nshe heard that he had died, she dressed in black, wrappe d the shoes up in a \nnewspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body. Fernanda would \nnot let her through the door. \n“Put yourself in my place,” Petra Cotes begged. “Imagine  how much I must \nhave loved him to put up with this humiliation.”",
            "20": "“There is no humiliation that a concubine does not dese rve,” Fernanda \nreplied. “So wait until another one of your men dies and put the shoes on him.” \nIn fulfillment of her promise, Santa Sofía de la Pie dad cut the throat of José \nArcadio Segundo’s corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they would not bury \nhim alive. The bodies were placed in identical coffins, a nd then it could be seen \nthat once more in death they had become as Identical as they had been until \nadolescence. Aureliano Segundo’s old carousing comrades lai d on his casket a \nwreath that had a purple ribbon with the words: Cease, cows, life is short . \nFernanda was so indignant with such irreverence that s he had the wreath thrown \nonto the trash heap. In the tumult of the last moment , the sad drunkards who \ncarried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried them in the \nwrong graves."

            "0": "AURELIANO DID NOT leave Melquíades’ room for a long  time. H e learned \nby heart the fantastic legends of the crumbling books, the  synthesis of the studies \nof Hermann the Cripple, the notes on the science of dem onology, the keys to the \nphilosopher’s stone, the Centuries  of Nostradamus and his research concerning \nthe plague, so that he reached adolescence without kno wing a thing about his \nown time but with the basic knowledge of a medieval m an. Any time that Santa \nSofía de la Piedad would go into his room she would find him absorbed in his \nreading. At dawn she would bring him a mug of coffee  without sugar and at noon \na plate of rice and slices of fried plantain, which wer e the only things eaten in the \nhouse since the death of Aureliano Segundo. She saw th at his hair was cut, \npicked off the nits, took in to his size the old clothing  that she found in forgotten \ntrunks, and when his mustache began to appear the broug ht him Colonel \nAureliano Buendía’s razor and the small gourd he had  used as a shaving mug. \nNone of the latter’s children had looked so much like hi m, not even Aureliano \nJosé, particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones and the firm and rather \npitiless line of the lips. As had happened to Úrsula wi th Aureliano Segundo when \nthe latter was studying in the room, Santa Sofía de la  P i e d a d  t h o u g h t  t h a t  \nAureliano was talking to himself. Actually, he was talking  to Melquíades. One \nburning noon, a short time after the death of the t wins, against the light of the \nwindow he saw the gloomy old man with his crow’s-wing ha t like the \nmaterialization of a memory that had been in his head  since long before he was \nborn. Aureliano had finished classifying the alphabet o f the parchments, so that \nwhen Melquíades asked him if he had discovered the langu age in which they had \nbeen written he did not hesitate to answer. \n“Sanskrit,” he said.",
            "1": "Melquíades revealed to him that his opportunities to  return to the room were \nlimited. But he would go in peace to the meadows of t he ultimate death because \nAureliano would have time to learn Sanskrit during th e years remaining until the \nparchments became one hundred years old, when they could b e deciphered. It \nwas he who indicated to Aureliano that on the narrow street going down to the \nriver, where dreams had been interpreted during the time of the banana \ncompany, a wise Catalonian had a bookstore where there w as a Sanskrit primer, \nwhich would be eaten by the moths within six years if h e did not hurry to buy it. \nFor the first time in her long life Santa Sofía de l a Piedad let a feeling show \nthrough, and it was a feeling of wonderment when Aur eliano asked her to bring \nhim the book that could be found between Jerusalem Delivered and Milton’s \npoems on the extreme right-hand side of the second shel f of the bookcases. \nSince she could not read, she memorized what he had sai d and got some money \nby selling one of the seventeen little gold fishes left  in the workshop, the \nwhereabouts of which, after being hidden the night t he soldiers searched the \nhouse, was known only by her and Aureliano. \nAureliano made progress in his studies of Sanskrit as Melqu íades’ visits \nbecame less and less frequent and he was more distant, fad ing away in the \nradiant light of noon. The last time that Aureliano sensed him he was only an \ninvisible presence who murmured: “I died of fever on t he sands of Singapore.” \nThe room then became vulnerable to dust, heat, termite s, red ants, and moths, \nwho would turn the wisdom of the parchments into sawdust . \nThere was no shortage of food in the house. The day a fter the death of \nAureliano Segundo, one of the friends who had brough t the wreath with the \nirreverent inscription offered to pay Fernanda some mon ey that he had owed her \nhusband. After that every Wednesday a delivery boy brought  a basket of food \nthat was quite sufficient for a week. No one ever knew  that those provisions were \nbeing sent by Petra Cotes with the idea that the contin uing charity was a way of",
            "2": "humiliating the person who had humiliated her. Never theless, the rancor \ndisappeared much sooner than she herself had expected, and then she \ncontinued sending the food out of pride and finally ou t of compassion. Several \ntimes, when she had no animals to raffle off and peop le lost interest in the lottery, \nshe went without food so that Fernanda could have some thing to eat, and she \ncontinued fulfilling the pledge to herself until she saw Fernanda’s funeral pro-\ncession pass by. \nFor Santa Sofía de la Piedad the reduction in the nu mber of inhabitants of \nthe house should have meant the rest she deserved after  m o r e  t h a n  h a l f  a  \ncentury of work. Never a lament had been heard from th at stealthy, impenetrable \nwoman who had sown in the family the angelic seed of Re medios the Beauty and \nthe mysterious solemnity of José Arcadio Segundo; who dedica ted a whole life of \nsolitude and diligence to the rearing of children alt hough she could barely \nremember whether they were her children or grandchil dren, and who took care of \nAureliano as if he had come out of her womb, not kno wing herself that she was \nhis great-grandmother. Only in a house like that was it conceivable for her always \nto sleep on a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in  the midst of the nocturnal \nnoise of the rats, and without telling anyone that one  night she had awakened \nwith the frightened feeling that someone was looking a t her in the darkness and \nthat it was a poisonous snake crawling over her stomach. S he knew that if she \nhad told Úrsula, the latter would have made her slee p in her own bed, but those \nwere times when no one was aware of anything unless it w as shouted on the \nporch, because with the bustle of the bakery, the surprise s of the war, the care of \nthe children, there was not much room for thinking ab out other peoples \nhappiness. Petra Cotes whom she had never seen, was the o nly one who \nremembered her. She saw to it that she had a good pa ir of shoes for street wear, \nthat she always had clothing, even during the times wh en the raffles were work-\ning only through some miracle. When Fernanda arrived a t the house she had",
            "3": "good reason to think that she was an ageless servant, and even though she \nheard it said several times that she was her husband’s mot her it was so \nincredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it. Santa Sofía de la \nPiedad never seemed bothered by that lowly position. O n the contrary, one had \nthe impression that she liked to stay in the corners, witho ut a pause, without a \ncomplaint, keeping clean and in order the immense house that she had lived in \never since adolescence and that, especially during the tim e of the banana \ncompany, was more like a barracks than a home. But when Úr sula died the \nsuperhuman diligence of Santa Sofía de la Piedad, her  tremendous capacity for \nwork, began to fall apart. It was not only that she wa s old and exhausted, but \novernight the house had plunged into a crisis of senili ty. A soft moss grew up the \nwalls. When there was no longer a bare spot in the cour tyard, the weeds broke \nthrough the cement of the porch, breaking it like glass,  and out of the cracks grew \nthe same yellow flowers that Úrsula had found in the gl ass with Melquíades’ false \nteeth a century before. With neither the time nor the  resources to halt the \nchallenge of nature, Santa Sofía de la Piedad spent t he day in the bedrooms \ndriving out the lizards who would return at night. On e morning she saw that the \nred ants had left the undermined foundations, crossed th e garden, climbed up the \nrailing, where the begonias had taken on an earthen co lor, and had penetrated \ninto the heart of the house. She first tried to kill t hem with a broom, then with \ninsecticides, and finally with lye, but the next day they w ere back in the same \nplace, still passing by, tenacious and invincible. Fernanda , writing letters to her \nchildren, was not aware of the unchecked destructive attack.  S an ta S ofía de l a \nPiedad continued struggling alone, fighting the weeds to stop them from getting \ninto the kitchen, pulling from the walls the tassels o f spider webs which were \nrebuilt in a few hours, scraping off the termites. But when she saw that \nMelquíades’ room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even though she swept \nand dusted three times a day, and that in spite of her  furious cleaning it was",
            "4": "threatened by the debris and the air of misery that h ad been foreseen only by \nColonel Aureliano Buendía and the young officer, she r ealized that she was \ndefeated. Then she put on her worn Sunday dress, some o ld shoes of Úrsula’s, \nand a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Úrsula had g iven her, and she made \na bundle out of the two or three changes of clothing t hat she had left. \n“I give up,” she said to Aureliano. “This is too much house for my poor \nbones.” \nAureliano asked her where she was going and she made a  vague sign, as if \nshe did not have the slightest idea of her destination.  S h e  t r i e d  t o  b e  m o r e  \nprecise, however, saying that she was going to spend her last years with a first \ncousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a likely expl anation. Since the death of \nher parents she had not had contact with anyone in town  or received letters or \nmessages, nor had she been heard to speak of any relativ es. Aureliano gave her \nfourteen little gold fishes because she was determine d to leave with only what \nshe had: one peso and twenty-five cents. From the window  of the room he saw \nher cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing, dra gging her feet and bent \nover by her years, and he saw her reach her hand throug h an opening in the \nmain door and replace the bar after she had gone out.  Nothing was ever heard of \nher again. \nWhen she heard about the flight, Fernanda ranted fo r a whole day as she \nchecked trunks, dressers, and closets, item by item, to make sure that Santa \nSofía de la Piedad had not made off with anything. S he burned her fingers trying \nto light a fire for the first time in her life and s he had to ask Aureliano to do her the \nfavor of showing her how to make coffee. Fernanda woul d find her breakfast \nready when she arose and she would leave her room aga in only to get the meal \nthat Aureliano had left covered on the embers for her,  which she would carry to \nthe table to eat on linen tablecloths and between cand elabra, sitting at the solitary \nhead of the table facing fifteen empty chairs. Even und er those circumstances",
            "5": "Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude,  but both continued living on \ntheir own, cleaning their respective rooms while the cobw ebs fell like snow on the \nrose bushes, carpeted the beams, cushioned the walls. It  was around that time \nthat Fernanda got the impression that the house was fil ling up with elves. It was \nas if things, especially those for everyday use, had develope d a faculty for \nchanging location on their own. Fernanda would waste t ime looking for the shears \nthat she was sure she had put on the bed and after tur ning everything upside \ndown she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen, where she thought she had \nnot been for four days. Suddenly there was no fork in th e silver chest and she \nwould find six on the altar and three in the washroom . That wandering about of \nthings was even more exasperating when she sat down to  write. The inkwell that \nshe had placed at her right would be on the left, th e blotter would be lost and she \nwould find it two days later under her pillow, and th e pages written to José \nArcadio would get mixed up with those written to Amar anta Úrsula, and she \nalways had the feeling of mortification that she had pu t the letters in opposite \nenvelopes, as in fact happened several times. On one occa sion she lost her \nfountain pen. Two weeks later the mailman, who had fo und it in his bag, returned \nit. He had been going from house to house looking for  its owner. At first she \nthought it was some business of the invisible doctors, like t he disappearance of \nthe pessaries, and she even started a letter to them be gging them to leave her \nalone, but she had to interrupt it to do something a nd when she went back to her \nroom she not only did not find the letter she had star ted but she had forgotten the \nreason for writing it. For a time she thought it was A ureliano. She began to spy on \nhim, to put things in his path trying to catch him when he changed their location, \nbut she was soon convinced that Aureliano never left Me lquíades’ room except to \ngo to the kitchen or the toilet, and that he was not a  man to play tricks. So in the \nend she believed that it was the mischief of elves an d she decided to secure \neverything in the place where she would use it. She ti ed the shears to the head of",
            "6": "her bed with a long string. She tied the pen and the  blotter to the leg of the table, \nand the glued the inkwell to the top of it to the ri ght of the place where she \nnormally wrote. The problems were not solved overnight , because a few hours \nafter she had tied the string to the shears it was not long enough for her to cut \nwith, as if the elves had shortened it. The same thing  h a pp en e d  t o  h e r  w i t h  t h e \nstring to the pen and even with her own arm which aft er a short time of writing \ncould not reach the inkwell. Neither Amaranta Úrsula i n Brussels nor José \nArcadio in Rome ever heard about those insignificant m isfortunes. Fernanda told \nthem that she was happy and in reality she was, precisely because she felt free \nfrom any compromise, as if life were pulling her once mo re toward the world of \nher parents, where one did not suffer with day-to-day problems because they \nwere solved beforehand in one’s imagination. That en dless correspondence \nmade her lose her sense of time, especially after Santa S ofía de la Piedad had \nleft. She had been accustomed to keep track of the days, m onths, and years, \nusing as points of reference the dates set for the retu rn of her children. But when \nthey changed their plans time and time again, the dat es became confused, the \nperiods were mislaid, and one day seemed so much like ano ther that one could \nnot feel them pass. Instead of becoming impatient, she f elt a deep pleasure in the \ndelay. It did not worry her that many years after announ cing the eve of his final \nvows, José Arcadio was still saying that he was waiting to finish his studies in \nadvanced theology in order to undertake those in diplo macy, because she \nunderstood how steep and paved with obstacles was the spir al stairway that led \nto the throne of Saint Peter. On the other hand, he r spirits rose with news that \nwould have been insignificant for other people, such a s the fact that her son had \nseen the Pope. She felt a similar pleasure when Amara nta Úrsula wrote to tell her \nthat her studies would last longer than the time forese en because her excellent \ngrades had earned her privileges that her father had not taken into account in his \ncalculations.",
            "7": "More than three years had passed since Santa Sofía de la  P i e d a d  h a d  \nbrought him the grammar when Aureliano succeeded in t ranslating the first sheet. \nIt was not a useless chore. but it was only a first step a long a road whose length it \nwas impossible to predict, because the text in Spanish di d not mean anything: the \nlines were in code. Aureliano lacked the means to establi sh the keys that would \npermit him to dig them out, but since Melquíades had t old him that the books he \nneeded to get to the bottom of the parchments were i n the wise Catalonian’s \nstore, he decided to speak to Fernanda so that she would let him get them. In the \nroom devoured by rubble, whose unchecked proliferation had finally defeated it, \nhe thought about the best way to frame the request, bu t when he found Fernanda \ntaking her meal from the embers, which was his only chan ce to speak to her, the \nlaboriously formulated request stuck in his throat and he  lost his voice. That was \nthe only time that he watched her. He listened to her steps in the bedroom. He \nheard her on her way to the door to await the letter s from her children and to give \nhers to the mailman, and he listened until late at ni ght to the harsh, impassioned \nscratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light switch \nand the murmur of her prayers in the darkness. Only then  did he go to sleep, \ntrusting that on the following day the awaited opport unity would come. He \nbecame so inspired with the idea that permission would be granted that one \nmorning he cut his hair, which at that time reached down to his shoulders, shaved \noff his tangled beard, put on some tight-fitting pant s and a shirt with an artificial \ncollar that he had inherited from he did not know wh om, and waited in the kitchen \nfor Fernanda to get her breakfast. The woman of every d ay, the one with her \nhead held high and with a stony gait, did not arrive,  b u t  a n  o l d  w o m a n  o f  \nsupernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape, a crown  of gilded cardboard, \nand the languid look of a person who wept in secret. Ac tually, ever since she had \nfound it in Aureliano Segundo’s trunks, Fernanda had p ut on the moth-eaten \nqueen’s dress many times. Anyone who could have seen her i n front of the",
            "8": "mirror, in ecstasy over her own regal gestures, would have  had reason to think \nthat she was mad. But she was not. She had simply turned the royal regalia into a \ndevice for her memory. The first time that she put it on  she could not help a knot \nfrom forming in her heart and her eyes filling with t ears because at that moment \nshe smelled once more the odor of shoe polish on the b oots of the officer who \ncame to get her at her house to make her a queen, and her soul brightened with \nthe nostalgia of her lost dreams. She felt so old, so wo rn out, so far away from \nthe best moments of her life that she even yearned for  those that she \nremembered as the worst, and only then did she discove r how much she missed \nthe whiff of oregano on the porch and the smell of t he roses at dusk, and even \nthe bestial nature of the parvenus. Her heart of compr essed ash, which had \nresisted the most telling blows of daily reality without strain, fell apart with the first \nwaves of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years \neroded her. She became human in her solitude. Neverthe less, the morning on \nwhich she entered the kitchen and found a cup of coff ee offered her by a pale \nand bony adolescent with a hallucinated glow in his ey es, the claws of ridicule \ntore at her. Not only did she refuse him permission, b ut from then on she carried \nthe keys to the house in the pocket where she kept the un used pessaries. It was \na useless precaution because if he had wanted to, Aurelia no could have escaped \nand even returned to the house without being seen. B ut the prolonged captivity, \nthe uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience h ad dried up the seeds of \nrebellion in his heart. So that he went back to his enc losure, reading and \nrereading the parchments and listening until very late  a t  n i g h t  t o  F e r n a n d a  \nsobbing in her bedroom. One morning he went to light  the fire as usual and on \nthe extinguished ashes he found the food that he had  left for her the day before. \nThen he looked into her bedroom and saw her lying on t he bed covered with the \nermine cape, more beautiful than ever and with her ski n turned into an ivory \ncasing. Four months later, when José Arcadio arrived, he found her intact.",
            "9": "It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his moth er. He was \nwearing a somber taffeta suit, a shirt with a round an d hard collar, and a thin silk \nribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie. He was rudd y and languid with a \nstartled look and weak lips. His black hair, shiny and smoot h, parted in the middle \nof his head by a straight and tired line, had the same  artificial appearance as the \nhair on the saints. The shadow of a well-uprooted bea rd on his paraffin face \nlooked like a question of conscience. His hands were pale, w ith green veins and \nfingers that were like parasites, and he wore a solid go ld ring with a round \nsunflower opal on his left index finger. When he open ed the street door Aureliano \ndid not have to be told who he was to realize that h e came from far away. With \nhis steps the house filled up with the fragrance of the toilet water that Úrsula used \nto splash on him when he was a child in order to find h im in the shadows, in some \nway impossible to ascertain, after so many years of absence.  José Arcadio was \nstill an autumnal child, terribly sad and solitary. He we nt directly to his mother’s \nbedroom, where Aureliano had boiled mercury for four  months in his \ngrandfather’s grandfather’s water pipe to conserve the body according to \nMelquíades’ formula. José Arcadio did not ask him any que stions. He kissed the \ncorpse on the forehead and withdrew from under her skir t the pocket of casing \nwhich contained three as yet unused pessaries and the key t o her cabinet. He did \neverything with direct and decisive movements, in contra st to his languid look. \nFrom the cabinet he took a small damascene chest with t he family crest and \nfound on the inside, which was perfumed with sandalwoo d, the long letter in \nwhich Fernanda unburdened her heart of the numerous truths that she had \nhidden from him. He read it standing up, avidly but w ithout anxiety, and at the \nthird page he stopped and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition. \n“So,” he said with a voice with a touch of razor in i t, “You’re the bastard.” \n“I’m Aureliano Buendía.” \n“Go to your room,” José Arcadio said.",
            "10": "Aureliano went and did not come out again even from curiosity when he \nheard the sound of the solitary funeral ceremonies. Some times, from the kitchen, \nhe would see José Arcadio strolling through the house, sm othered by his anxious \nbreathing, and he continued hearing his steps in the r uined bedrooms after \nmidnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, no t only because José \nArcadio never addressed him, but also because he had no d esire for it to happen \nor time to think about anything else but the parchmen ts. On Fernanda’s death he \nhad taken out the next-to-the-last little fish and go ne to the wise Catalonian’s \nbookstore in search of the books he needed. Nothing he sa w along the way \ninterested him, perhaps because he lacked any memories for  comparison and the \ndeserted streets and desolate houses were the same as he ha d imagined them at \na time when he would have given his soul to know them.  He had given himself \nthe permission denied by Fernanda and only once and for  t h e  m i n i m u m  t i m e  \nnecessary, so without pausing he went along the eleven bl ocks that separated \nthe house from the narrow street where dreams had been  i n t e r p r e t e d  i n  o th e r  \ndays and he went panting into the confused and gloomy pl ace where there was \nbarely room to move. More than a bookstore, it looked l ike a dump for used \nbooks, which were placed in disorder on the shelves chew ed by termites, in the \ncorners sticky with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that were supposed to serve \nas passageways. On a long table, also heaped with old boo ks and papers, the \nproprietor was writing tireless prose in purple letters,  somewhat outlandish, and \non the loose pages of a school notebook. He had a handso me head of silver hair \nwhich fell down over his forehead like the plume of a  cockatoo, and his blue eyes, \nlively and close-set, revealed the gentleness of a man w ho had read all of the \nbooks. He was wearing short pants and soaking in perspirat ion, and he did not \nstop his writing to see who had come in. Aureliano had no difficulty in rescuing \nthe five books that he was looking for from that fabul ous disorder, because they \nwere exactly where Melquíades had told him they would b e. Without saying a",
            "11": "word he handed them, along with the little gold fis h, to the wise Catalonian and \nthe latter examined them, his eyelids contracting like tw o clams. “You must be \nmad,” he said in his own language, shrugging his shoul ders, and he handed back \nto Aureliano the five books and the little fish. \n“You can have them” he said in Spanish. “The last man  who read these \nbooks must have been Isaac the Blindman, so consider well w hat you’re doing.” \nJosé Arcadio restored Meme’s bedroom and had the velvet curtains cleaned \nand mended along with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal bed, and he \nput to use once more the abandoned bathroom where the  cement pool was \nblackened by a fibrous and rough coating. He restricted hi s vest-pocket empire of \nworn, exotic clothing, false perfumes, and cheap jewelry to those places. The \nonly thing that seemed to worry him in the rest of the house were the saints on \nthe family altar, which he burned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he \nlighted in the courtyard. He would sleep until past el even o’clock. He would go to \nthe bathroom in a shabby robe with golden dragons on it and a pair of slippers \nwith yellow tassels, and there he would officiate at a r ite which for its care and \nlength recalled Remedios the Beauty. Before bathing he  would perfume the pool \nwith the salts that he carried in three alabaster flacon s. He did not bathe himself \nwith the gourd but would plunge into the fragrant w aters and remain there for two \nhours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness and by th e memory of \nAmaranta. A few days after arriving he put aside his t affeta suit, which in addition \nto being too hot for the town was the only one that h e had, and he exchanged it \nfor some tight-fitting pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his \ndance lessons and a silk shirt woven with thread from li ving caterpillars and with \nhis initials embroidered over the heart. Twice a week h e would wash the \ncomplete change in the tub and would wear his robe un til it dried because he had \nnothing else to put on. He never ate at home. He wou ld go out when the heat of \nsiesta time had eased and would not return until well into the night. Then he",
            "12": "would continue his anxious pacing, breathing like a cat a nd thinking about \nAmaranta. She and the frightful look of the saints in the glow of the nocturnal \nlamp were the two memories he retained of the house. Many times during the \nhallucinating Roman August he had opened his eyes in t he middle of his sleep \nand had seen Amaranta rising out of a marble-edged p ool with her lace petticoats \nand the bandage on her hand, idealized by the anxiet y of exile. Unlike Aureliano \nJosé who tried to drown that image in the bloody bog of war, he tried to keep it \nalive in the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his mother with the \nendless fable of his pontifical vocation. It never occur red either to him or to \nFernanda to think that their correspondence was an excha nge of fantasies. José \nArcadio, who left the seminary as soon as he reached Rome , continued \nnourishing the legend of theology and canon law so as n ot to jeopardize the \nfabulous inheritance of which his mother’s delirious let ters spoke and which \nwould rescue him from the misery and sordidness he shared  with two friends in a \nTrastevere garret. When he received Fernanda’s last let ter, dictated by the \nforeboding of imminent death, he put the leftovers o f his false splendor into a \nsuitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship where  immigrants were \ncrammed together like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eatin g cold macaroni and \nwormy cheese. Before he read Fernanda’s will, which was nothing but a detailed \nand tardy recapitulation of her misfortunes, the broken- down furniture and the \nweeds on the porch had indicated that he had fallen i nto a trap from which he \nwould never escape, exiled forever from the diamond li ght and timeless air of the \nRoman spring. During the crushing insomnia brought on by his asthma he would \nmeasure and re-measure the depth of his misfortune as h e went through the \nshadowy house where the senile fussing of Úrsula had insti lled a fear of the world \nin him. In order to be sure that she would not lose him in the shadows, she had \nassigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only one wher e he would be safe from \nthe dead people who wandered through the house after  sundown. “If you do",
            "13": "anything bad,” Úrsula would tell him, “the saints will let me know.” The terror-filled \nnights of his childhood were reduced to that corner whe re he would remain \nmotionless until it was time to go to bed, perspiring w ith fear on a stool under the \nwatchful and glacial eyes of the tattletale saints. It wa s useless torture because \neven at that time he already had a terror of everythi ng around him and he was \nprepared to be frightened at anything he met in life : women on the street, who \nwould ruin his blood; the women in the house, who bo re children with the tail of a \npig; fighting cocks, who brought on the death of men an d remorse for the rest of \none’s life; firearms, which with the mere touch would  bring down twenty years of \nwar; uncertain ventures, which led only to disillusionm ent and madness—\neverything, in short, everything that God had created in His infinite goodness and \nthat the devil had perverted. When he awakened, pressed  in the vise of his night-\nmares, the light in the window and the caresses of Amara nta in the bath and the \npleasure of being powdered between the legs with a s ilk puff would release him \nfrom the terror. Even Úrsula was different under the radiant light in the garden \nbecause there she did not talk about fearful things b ut would brush his teeth with \ncharcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smil e of a Pope, and she \nwould cut and polish his nails so that the pilgrims wh o came to Rome from all \nover the world would be startled at the beauty of the  Pope’s hands as he blessed \nthem, and she would comb his hair like that of a Pope,  and she would sprinkle his \nbody and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and his clothes would have \nthe fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gan dolfo he had seen the \nPope on a balcony making the same speech in seven lang uages for a crowd of \npilgrims and the only thing, indeed, that had drawn h is attention was the \nwhiteness of his hands, which seemed to have been soaked  in lye, the dazzling \nshine of his summer clothing, and the hidden breath of  cologne. \nAlmost a year after his return home, having sold the si lver candlesticks and \nthe heraldic chamberpot—which at the moment of truth  turned out to have only a",
            "14": "little gold plating on the crest—in order to eat, the only distraction of José Arcadio \nwas to pick up children in town so that they could play in  the house. He would \nappear with them at siesta time and have them skip rope  in the garden, sing on \nthe porch, and do acrobatics on the furniture in the l iving room while he would go \namong the groups giving lessons in good manners. At tha t time he had finished \nwith the tight pants and the silk shirts and was wearing  an ordinary suit of clothing \nthat he had bought in the Arab stores, but he still ma intained his languid dignity \nand his papal air. The children took over the house just  as Meme’s schoolmates \nhad done in the past. Until well into the night they could be heard chattering and \nsinging and tap-dancing, so that the house resembled a boarding school where \nthere was no discipline. Aureliano did not worry about the invasion as long as \nthey did not bother him in Melquíades’ room. One morn ing two children pushed \nopen the door and were startled at the sight of a fil thy and hairy man who was still \ndeciphering the parchments on the worktable. They did no t dare go in, but they \nkept on watching the room. They would peep in through  the cracks, whispering, \nthey threw live animals in through the transom, and on one occasion they nailed \nup the door and the window and it took Aureliano hal f a day to force them open. \nAmused at their unpunished mischief, four of the chil dren went into the room one \nmorning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, preparing  to destroy the parchments. \nBut as soon as they laid hands on the yellowed sheets an an gelic force lifted \nthem off the ground and held them suspended in the a ir until Aureliano returned \nand took the parchments away from them. From then on t hey did not bother him. \nThe four oldest children, who wore short pants in spit e of the fact that they \nwere on the threshold of adolescence, busied themselves  with José Arcadio’s \npersonal appearance. They would arrive earlier than th e others and spend the \nmorning shaving him, giving him massages with hot towel s, cutting and polishing \nthe nails on his hands and feet, and perfuming him wi th toilet water. On several \noccasions they would get into the pool to soap him from h ead to toe as he floated",
            "15": "on his back thinking about Amaranta. Then they would dr y him, powder his body, \nand dress him. One of the children, who had curly blon d hair and eyes of pink \nglass like a rabbit, was accustomed to sleeping in the house . The bonds that \nlinked him to José Arcadio were so strong that he would a ccompany him in his \nasthmatic insomnia, without speaking, strolling through t he house with him in the \ndarkness. One night in the room where Úrsula had slept  they saw a yellow glow \ncoming through the crumbling cement as if an undergro und sun had changed the \nfloor of the room into a pane of glass. They did not h ave to turn on the light. It \nwas sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner whe re Úrsula’s bed had always \nstood and where the glow was most intense to find the se cret crypt that Aureliano \nSegundo had worn himself out searching for during the  d e l i r i u m  o f  h i s  \nexcavations. There were the three canvas sacks closed with co pper wire, and \ninside of them the seven thousand two hundred fourteen  pieces of eight, which \ncontinued glowing like embers in the darkness. \nThe discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration. In stead of returning to \nRome with the sudden fortune, which had been his dre am maturing in misery, \nJosé Arcadio converted the house into a decadent paradise. He replaced the \ncurtains and the canopy of the bed with new velvet, an d he had the bathroom \nfloor covered with paving stones and the walls with til es. The cupboard in the \ndining room was filled with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles, and the unused \npantry was opened again for the storage of wines and li queurs which José \nArcadio himself brought from the railroad station in cr ates marked with his name. \nOne night he and the four oldest children had a part y that lasted until dawn. At six \nin the morning they came out naked from the bedroom, d rained the pool, and \nfilled it with champagne. They jumped in en masse, swim ming like birds flying \nthrough a sky gilded with fragrant bubbles, while José Ar cadio, floated on his \nback on the edge of the festivities, remembering Amarant a with his eyes open. \nHe remained that way, wrapped up in himself, thinking about the bitterness of his",
            "16": "equivocal pleasures until after the children had becom e tired and gone in a troop \nto the bedroom. where they tore down the curtains to dry themselves, and in the \ndisorder they broke the rock crystal mirror into four piece s and destroyed the \ncanopy of the bed in the tumult of lying down. When José Arcadio came back \nfrom the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a naked heap in the shipwrecked \nbedroom. Inflamed, not so much because of the damage a s because of the \ndisgust and pity that he felt for himself in the emptin ess of the saturnalia, he \narmed himself with an ecclesiastical cat-o-nine-tails tha t he kept in the bottom of \nhis trunk along with a hair-shirt and other instruments of mortification and \npenance, and drove the children out of the house, how ling like a madman and \nwhipping them without mercy as a person would not even have done to a pack of \ncoyotes. He was done in, with an attack of asthma that last ed for several days \nand that gave him the look of a man on his deathbed. On the third night of torture, \novercome by asphyxiation, he went to Aureliano’s room to  ask him the favor of \nbuying some powders to inhale at a nearby drugstore. S o it was that Aureliano, \nwent out for a second time. He had to go only two blocks  to reach the small \npharmacy with dusty windows and ceramic bottles with labels in Latin where a girl \nwith the stealthy beauty of a serpent of the Nile gave  him the medicine the name \nof which José Arcadio had written down on a piece of pa per. The second view of \nthe deserted town, barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the street lights, \ndid not awaken in Aureliano any more curiosity than th e first. José Arcadio, had \ncome to think that he had run away, when he reappeared , panting a little because \nof his haste, dragging legs that enclosure and lack of mo bility had made weak \nand heavy. His indifference toward the world was so certa in that a few days later \nJosé Arcadio violated the promise he had made to his moth er and left him free to \ngo out whenever he wanted to. \n“I have nothing to do outside,” Aureliano answered hi m.",
            "17": "He remained shut up, absorbed in the parchments, which  he was slowly \nunraveling and whose meaning, nevertheless, he was unab le to interpret. José \nArcadio would bring slices of ham to him in his room, su gared flowers which left a \nspring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a  glass of fine wine. He \nwas not interested in the parchments, which he thought  of more as an esoteric \npastime, but his attention was attracted by the rare wi sdom and the inexplicable \nknowledge of the world that his desolate kinsman had. H e discovered then that \nhe could understand written English and that between parchments he had gone \nfrom the first page to the last of the six volumes of t he encyclopedia as if it were a \nnovel. At first he attributed to that the fact that A ureliano could speak about Rome \nas if he had lived there many years, but he soon became aware that he knew \nthings that were not in the encyclopedia, such as the pr ice of items. “Everything is \nknown,” was the only reply he received from Aureliano wh en he asked him where \nhe had got that information from. Aureliano, for hi s part, was surprised that José \nArcadio when seen from close by was so different from th e image that he had \nformed of him when he saw him wandering through the house. He was capable of \nlaughing, of allowing himself from time to time a f eeling of nostalgia for the past of \nthe house, and of showing concern for the state of mise ry present in Melquíades’ \nroom. That drawing closer together of two solitary peo ple of the same blood was \nfar from friendship, but it did allow them both to bear up better under the \nunfathomable solitude that separated and united them at the same time. José \nArcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certa in domestic problems that \nexasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and re ad on the porch, waiting for \nthe letters from Amaranta Úrsula, which still arrived  with the usual punctuality, \nand could use the bathroom, from which José Arcadio had banished him when he \narrived. \nOne hot dawn they both woke up in alarm at an urgent  knocking on the \nstreet door. It was a dark old man with large green e yes that gave his face a",
            "18": "ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes on his for ehead. His clothing \nin tatters, his shoes cracked, the old knapsack on his should er his only luggage, \nhe looked like a beggar, but his bearing had a dignity that was in frank \ncontradiction to his appearance. It was only necessary to lo ok at him once, even \nin the shadows of the parlor, to realize that the secr et strength that allowed him to \nlive was not the instinct of self-preservation but the h abit of fear. It was Aureliano \nAmador, the only survivor of Colonel Aureliano Buendí a’s seventeen sons, \nsearching for a respite in his long and hazardous existen ce as a fugitive. He \nidentified himself, begged them to give him refuge i n that house which during his \nnights as a pariah he had remembered as the last redoub t of safety left for him in \nlife. But José Arcadio and Aureliano did not remember him. Thinking that he was \na tramp, they pushed him into the street. They both saw  from the doorway the \nend of a drama that had began before José Arcadio had reached the age of \nreason. Two policemen who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, who \nhad tracked him like bloodhounds across half the world, ca me out from among \nthe almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and took two shots with their Mausers \nwhich neatly penetrated the cross of ashes. \nEver since he had expelled the children from the house , José Arcadio was \nreally waiting for news of an ocean liner that would l eave for Naples before \nChristmas. He had told Aureliano and had even made pl ans to set him up in a \nbusiness that would bring him a living, because the baske ts of food had stopped \ncoming since Fernanda’s burial. But that last dream woul d not be fulfilled either. \nOne September morning, after having coffee in the kitc hen with Aureliano, José \nArcadio was finishing his daily bath when through the openings in the tiles the \nfour children he had expelled from the house burst in.  Without giving him time to \ndefend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothe d, grabbed him by the hair, \nand held his head under the water until the bubblin g of his death throes ceased \non the surface and his silent and pale dolphin body di pped down to the bottom of",
            "19": "the fragrant water. Then they took out the three sacks of  g o l d  f r o m  t h e  h i d i n g \nplace which was known only to them and their victim. It  was such a rapid, \nmethodical, and brutal action that it was like a milita ry operation. Aureliano, shut \nup in his room, was not aware of anything. That aftern oon, having missed him in \nthe kitchen, he looked for José Arcadio all over the hou se and found him floating \non the perfumed mirror of the pool, enormous and bl oated and still thinking about \nAmaranta. Only then did he understand how much he had  began to love him."

She ap-\npeared without warning, wearing an ivory-colored dress,  a string of pearls that \nreached almost to her knees, emerald and topaz rings, a nd with her straight hair \nin a smooth bun held behind her ears by swallow-tail brooches. The man whom \nshe had married six months before was a thin, older Fle ming with the look of a \nsailor about him. She had only to push open the door to the parlor to realize that \nher absence had been longer and more destructive than sh e had imagined. \n“Good Lord,” she shouted, more gay than alarmed, “it’s obvious that there’s \nno woman in this house!” \nThe baggage would not fit on the porch. Besides Ferna nda’s old trunk, which \nthey had sent her off to school with, she had two uprigh t trunks, four large \nsuitcases, a bag for her parasols, eight hatboxes, a gigan tic cage with half a \nhundred canaries, and her husband’s velocipede, broken d own in a special case \nwhich allowed him to carry it like a cello. She did no t even take a day of rest after \nthe long trip. She put on some worn denim overalls th at her husband had brought \nalong with other automotive items and set about on a n ew restoration of the \nhouse. She scattered the red ants, who had already taken possession of the \nporch, brought the rose bushes back to life, uprooted th e weeds, and planted \nferns, oregano, and begonias again in the pots along t he railing. She took charge \nof a crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons, who filled in the cracks in the \nfloor, put doors and windows back on their hinges, repai red the furniture, and \nwhite-washed the walls inside and out, so that three m onths after her arrival one \nbreathed once more the atmosphere of youth and festivity that had existed during \nthe days of the pianola.

With a \nsweep of her broom she did away with the funeral memen tos and piles of useless \ntrash and articles of superstition that had been piling up in the corners, and the \nonly thing she spared, out of gratitude to Úrsula, wa s the daguerreotype of \nRemedios in the parlor. “My, such luxury,” she would shou t, dying with laughter. \n“A fourteen-year-old grandmother!” When one of the m asons told her that the \nhouse was full of apparitions and that the only way to d rive them out was to look \nfor the treasures they had left buried, she replied am id loud laughter that she did \nnot think it was right for men to be superstitious. Sh e was so spontaneous, so \nemancipated, with such a free and modern spirit, that  A u r e l i an o d i d n o t  kn o w  \nwhat to do with his body when he saw her arrive. “My, m y!” she shouted happily \nwith open arms. “Look at how my darling cannibal has gr own!” Before he had a \nchance to react she had already put a record on the port able phonograph she \nhad brought with her and was trying to teach him the l atest dance steps. She \nmade him change the dirty pants that he had inherited  f r o m  C o l on e l  A u r el i an o \nBuendía and gave him some youthful shirts and two-tone d shoes, and she would \npush him into the street when he was spending too much  time in Melquíades’ \nroom. \nActive, small, and indomitable like Úrsula, and almost  as pretty and \nprovocative as Remedios the Beauty, she was endowed with  a rare instinct for \nanticipating fashion. When she received pictures of th e most recent fashions in \nthe mail, they only proved that she had not been wron g about the models that she \ndesigned herself and sewed on Amaranta’s primitive peda l machine. She \nsubscribed to every fashion magazine, art publication. an d popular music review \npublished in Europe, and she had only to glance at th em to realize that things in \nthe world were going just as she imagined they were.

            "2": "dust and heat, and much less with a husband who had mor e than enough money \nto live anywhere in the world and who loved her so mu ch that he let himself be \nled around by her on a silk leash. As time passed, howeve r, her intention to stay \nwas more obvious, because she did not make any plans that were not a long way \noff, nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the search for a \ncomfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. Th e canary cage showed \nthat those aims were made up on the spur of the moment . Remembering that her \nmother had told her in a letter about the extermina tion of the birds, she had \ndelayed her trip several months until she found a ship that stopped at the \nFortunate Isles and there she chose the finest twenty-fiv e pairs of canaries so \nthat she could repopulate the skies of Macondo. That was the most lamentable of \nher numerous frustrated undertakings. As the birds reprod uced Amaranta Úrsula \nwould release them in pairs, and no sooner did they fe el themselves free than \nthey fled the town. She tried in vain to awaken love in them by means of the bird \ncage that Úrsula had built during the first reconstructi on of the house. Also in vain \nwere the artificial nests built of esparto grass in the a lmond trees and the \nbirdseed strewn about the roofs, and arousing the captiv es so that their songs \nwould dissuade the deserters, because they would take fli ghts on their first \nattempts and make a turn in the sky, just the time needed  to find the direction to \nthe Fortunate Isles. \nA year after her return, although she had not succeede d in making any \nfriends or giving any parties, Amaranta Úrsula still be lieved that it was possible to \nrescue the community which had been singled out by misfort une. Gaston, her \nhusband, took care not to antagonize her, although since  that fatal noon when he \ngot off the train he realized that his wife’s determi nation had been provoked by a \nnostalgic mirage.

Later  on, thinking that \nAmaranta Úrsula was continuing with her repairs so that  her hands would not be \nidle, he decided to assemble the handsome bicycle, on whic h the front wheel was \nmuch larger than the rear one, and he dedicated himse lf to the capture and \ncuring of every native insect he could find in the regio n, which he sent in jam jars \nto his former professor of natural history at the Univer sity of Liège where he had \ndone advanced work in entomology, although his main voca tion was that of \naviator. When he rode the bicycle he would wear acrobat ’s tights, gaudy socks, \nand a Sherlock Holmes cap, but when he was on foot he would dress in a \nspotless natural linen suit, white shoes, a silk bow tie,  a straw boater, and he \nwould carry a willow stick in his hand. His pale eyes accent uated his look of a \nsailor and his small mustache looked like the fur of a sq uirrel. Although he was at \nleast fifteen years older than his wife, his alert det ermination to make her happy \nand his qualities as a good lover compensated for the di fference. Actually, those \nwho saw that man in his forties with careful habits, wit h the leash around his neck \nand his circus bicycle, would not have thought that he ha d made a pact of \nunbridled love with his wife and that they both gave in to the reciprocal drive in \nthe least adequate of places and wherever the spirit mov ed them, as they had \ndone since they had began to keep company, and with a pa ssion that the \npassage of time and the more and more unusual circumst ances deepened and \nenriched. Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endle ss wisdom and \nimagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in  the history of the species \nwho had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and \nhis sweetheart simply to make love in a field of violets.  \nThey had met two years before they were married, when t he sports biplane \nin which he was making rolls over the school where Amar anta Úrsula was \nstudying made an intrepid maneuver to avoid the flagp ole and the primitive",

They began to love each other at an altitude of fifteen \nhundred feet in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt all the closer together \nas the beings on earth grew more and more minute. She  spoke to him of \nMacondo as the brightest and most peaceful town on earth , and of an enormous \nhouse, scented with oregano, where she wanted to live u ntil old age with a loyal \nhusband and two strong sons who would be named Rodrigo  and Gonzalo, never \nAureliano and José Arcadio, and a daughter who would b e named Virginia and \nnever Remedios. She had evoked the town idealized by n ostalgia with such \nstrong tenacity that Gaston understood that she would no t get married unless he \ntook her to live in Macondo. He agreed to it, as he ag reed later on to the leash, \nbecause he thought it was a passing fancy that could be ov ercome in time. But \nwhen two years in Macondo had passed and Amaranta Úrsula  was as happy as \non the first day, he began to show signs of alarm.

Am aranta Úrsula, on the other \nhand, had brought in by train fish and shellfish in boxes of ice, canned meats and \npreserved fruits, which were the only things she could e at, and she still dressed in \nEuropean style and received designs by mail in spite of the  fact that she had no \nplace to go and no one to visit and by that time her hu sband was not in a mood to \nappreciate her short skirts, her tilted felt hat, and h er seven-strand necklaces.

Her festive genius was still so alive then that when \nshe received new records she would invite Gaston to stay in  the parlor until very \nlate to practice the dance steps that her schoolmates describ ed to her in sketches \nand they would generally end up making love on the Vie nnese rocking chairs or \non the bare floor. The only thing that she needed to be completely happy was the \nbirth of her children, but she respected the pact she ha d made with her husband \nnot to have any until they had been married for five years. \nLooking for something to fill his idle hours with, Gasto n became accustomed \nto spending the morning in Melquíades’ room with the  shy Aureliano. He took \npleasure in recalling with him the most hidden corners of his country, which \nAureliano knew as if he had spent much time there. Wh en Gaston asked him \nwhat he had done to obtain knowledge that was not in  the encyclopedia, he \nreceived the same answer as José Arcadio: “Everything Is know n.” In addition to \nSanskrit he had learned English and French and a litt le Latin and Greek. Since he \nwent out every afternoon at that time and Amaranta Ú rsula had set aside a \nweekly sum for him for his personal expenses, his room lo oked like a branch of \nthe wise Catalonian’s bookstore. He read avidly until la te at night, although from \nthe manner in which he referred to his reading, Gasto n thought that he did not \nbuy the books in order to learn but to verify the trut h of his knowledge, and that \nnone of them interested him more than the parchments,  to wh i ch  h e dedi cated \nmost of his time in the morning. Both Gaston and his w ife would have liked to \nincorporate him into the family life, but Aureliano w as a hermetic man with a cloud \nof mystery that time was making denser.

Actually, he had it fairly wel l advanced when he met \nAmaranta Úrsula, except that it was not for Macondo, but for the Belgian Congo, \nwhere his family had investments in palm oil. The marria ge and the decision to \nspend a few months in Macondo to please his wife had obl iged him to postpone \nit. But when he saw that Amaranta Úrsula was determine d to organize a \ncommission for public improvement and even laughed at h im when he hinted at \nthe possibility of returning, he understood that things were going to take a long \ntime and he reestablished contact with his forgotten p artners in Brussels, thinking \nthat it was just as well to be a pioneer in the Caribb ean as in Africa. While his \nsteps were progressing he prepared a landing field in t he old enchanted region \nwhich at that time looked like a plain of crushed flin tstone, and he studied the \nwind direction, the geography of the coastal region, a nd the best routes for aerial \nnavigation, without knowing that his diligence, so simi lar to that of Mr. Herbert, \nwas filling the town with the dangerous suspicion that his plan was not to set up \nroutes but to plant banana trees. Enthusiastic over the  i dea th at, after al l , mi gh t \njustify his permanent establishment in Macondo, he took se veral trips to the \ncapital of the province, met with authorities, obtained  licenses, and drew up con-\ntracts for exclusive rights. In the meantime he maintain ed a correspondence with \nhis partners in Brussels which resembled that of Fernand a with the invisible \ndoctors, and he finally convinced them to ship the first ai rplane under the care of \nan expert mechanic, who would assemble it in the neare st port and fly it to \nMacondo. One year after his first meditations and mete orological calculations, \ntrusting in the repeated promises of his correspondents, he had acquired the \nhabit of strolling through the streets, looking at the sky, hanging onto the sound of \nthe breeze in hopes that the airplane would appear.",
            "7": "Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amara nta Úrsula had brought \non a radical change in Aureliano’s life. After the death of José Arcadio he had \nbecome a regular customer at the wise Catalonian’s bookst ore. Also, the freedom \nthat he enjoyed then and the time at his disposal awoke in him a certain curiosity \nabout the town, which he came to know without any sur prise. He went through \nthe dusty and solitary streets, examining with scientific i nterest the inside of \nhouses in ruin, the metal screens on the windows broken by rust and the dying \nbirds, and the inhabitants bowed down by memories. He t ried to reconstruct in his \nimagination the annihilated splendor of the old bana na-company town, whose dry \nswimming pool was filled to the brim with rotting men ’s and women’s shoes, and \nin the houses of which, destroyed by rye grass, he found t he skeleton of a \nGerman shepherd dog still tied to a ring by a steel ch ain and a telephone that \nwas ringing, ringing, ringing until he picked it up an d an anguished and distant \nwoman spoke in English, and he said yes, that the strike was over, that three \nthousand dead people had been thrown into the sea, th at the banana company \nhad left, and that Macondo finally had peace after ma ny years. Those wanderings \nled him to the prostrate red-light district, where in other times bundles of \nbanknotes had been burned to liven up the revels, and  which at that time was a \nmaze of streets more afflicted and miserable than the o thers, with a few red lights \nstill burning and with deserted dance halls adorned wi th the remnants of wreaths, \nwhere the pale, fat widows of no one, the French gre at-grandmothers and the \nBabylonian matriarchs, were still waiting beside their photographs. Aureliano \ncould not find anyone who remembered his family, not e ven Colonel Aureliano \nBuendía, except for the oldest of the West Indian Negr oes, an old man whose \ncottony hair gave him the look of a photographic negati ve and who was still \nsinging the mournful sunset psalms in the door of his ho use. Aureliano would talk \nto him in the tortured Papiamento that he had learn ed in a few weeks and \nsometimes he would share his chicken-head soup, prepared by the great-",

She was a large black woman w ith solid bones, the hips \nof a mare, teats like live melons, and a round and per fect head armored with a \nhard surface of wiry hair which looked like a medieval warrior’s mail headdress. \nHer name was Nigromanta. In those days Aureliano lived off the sale of \nsilverware, candlesticks, and other bric-a-brac from the ho use. When he was \npenniless, which was most of the time, he got people in  the back of the market to \ngive him the chicken heads that they were going to thro w away and he would \ntake them to Nigromanta to make her soups, fortified wi th purslane and seasoned \nwith mint. When the great-grandfather died Aurelian o stopped going by the \nhouse, but he would run into Nigromanta under the da rk almond trees on the \nsquare, using her wild-animal whistles to lure the few night owls. Many times he \nstayed with her, speaking in Papiamento about chicken-he ad soup and other \ndainties of misery, and he would have kept right on if she had not let him know \nthat his presence frightened off customers. Although he so metimes felt the \ntemptation and although Nigromanta herself might hav e seemed to him as the \nnatural culmination of a shared nostalgia, he did no t go to bed with her. So \nAureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Úrsula retu rned to Macondo and gave \nhim a sisterly embrace that left him breathless. Every ti me he saw her, and worse \nyet when she showed him the latest dances, he felt the same spongy release in \nhis bones that had disturbed his great-great-grandfathe r when Pilar Ternera \nmade her pretexts about the cards in the granary. Trying  to squelch the torment, \nhe sank deeper into the parchments and eluded the inno cent flattery of that aunt \nwho was poisoning his nights with a flow of tribulatio n, but the more he avoided \nher the more the anxiety with which he waited for he r stony laughter, her howls of \na happy cat, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing in l ove at all hours and in the \nmost unlikely parts of the house. One night thirty feet  from his bed, on the silver \nworkbench, the couple with unhinged bellies broke the  bottles and ended up \nmaking love in a pool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not  only could not sleep for a",
            "9": "single second, but he spent the next day with a fever, so bbing with rage. The first \nnight that he waited for Nigromanta to come to the s hadows of the almond trees it \nseemed like an eternity, pricked as he was by the needles of  uncertainty and \nclutching in his fist the peso and fifty cents that he had asked Amaranta Úrsula \nfor, not so much because he needed it as to involve her,  debase her, prostitute \nher in his adventure in some way. Nigromanta took him t o her room, which was \nlighted with false candlesticks, to her folding cot with t he bedding stained from \nbad loves, and to her body of a wild dog, hardened an d without soul, which \nprepared itself to dismiss him as if he were a frightene d child, and suddenly it \nfound a man whose tremendous power demanded a movemen t of seismic \nreadjustment from her insides. \nThey became lovers. Aureliano would spend his mornings de ciphering \nparchments and at siesta time he would go to the bedroo m where Nigromanta \nwas waiting for him, to teach him first how to do it like earthworms, then like \nsnails, and finally like crabs, until she had to leave hi m and lie in wait for \nvagabond loves. Several weeks passed before Aureliano di scovered that around \nher waist she wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string, but \nwhich was hard as steel and had no end, as if it had be en born and grown with \nher. Almost always, between loves, they would eat naked in the bed, in the \nhallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that th e rust had caused to shine \non the zinc ceiling. It was the first time that Nigrom anta had had a steady man, a \nbone crusher from head to toe, as she herself said, dying  with laughter, and she \nhad even begun to get romantic illusions when Aurelia no confided in her about \nhis repressed passion for Amaranta Úrsula, which he had not been able to cure \nwith the substitution but which was twisting him insid e all the more as experience \nbroadened the horizons of love. After that Nigromanta  continued to receive him \nwith the same warmth as ever but she made him pay for her services so strictly \nthat when Aureliano had no money she would make an add ition to his bill, which",
            "10": "was not figured in numbers but by marks that she made with her thumbnail \nbehind the door. At sundown, while she was drifting t hrough the shadows in the \nsquare, Aureliano, was going along the porch like a str anger, scarcely greeting \nAmaranta Úrsula and Gaston, who usually dined at that  time, and shutting herself \nup in his room again, unable to read or write or eve n think because of the anxiety \nbrought on by the laughter, the whispering, the preli minary frolics, and then the \nexplosions of agonizing happiness that capped the nights in the house. That was \nhis life two years before Gaston began to wait for the airplane, and it went on the \nsame way on the afternoon that he went to the bookstore  of the wise Catalonian \nand found four ranting boys in a heated argument abou t the methods used to kill \ncockroaches in the Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing  abou t Au reli an o’ s \nlove for books that had been read only by the Venerable  Bede, urged him with a \ncertain fatherly malice to get into the discussion, and w ithout even taking a \nbreath, he explained that the cockroach, the oldest wi nged insect on the face of \nthe earth, had already been the victim of slippers in th e Old Testament, but that \nsince the species was definitely resistant to any and all me thods of extermination, \nfrom tomato dices with borax to flour and sugar, and  with its one thousand six \nhundred three varieties had resisted the most ancient, t enacious, and pitiless \npersecution that mankind had unleashed against any living  thing since the \nbeginnings, including man himself, to such an extent tha t just as an instinct for \nreproduction was attributed to humankind, so there must have been another one \nmore definite and pressing, which was the instinct to kil l cockroaches, and if the \nlatter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was beca use they had taken \nrefuge in the shadows, where they became invulnerable b ecause of man’s \ncongenital fear of the dark, but on the other hand th ey became susceptible to the \nglow of noon, so that by the Middle Ages already, and i n present times, and per \nomnia secula seculorum , the only effective method for killing cockroaches was \nthe glare of the sun.",
            "11": "That encyclopedic coincidence was the beginning of a great  f r i e n d s h i p .  \nAureliano continued getting together in the afternoo n with the four arguers, whose \nnames were Álvaro, Germán, Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends that \nhe ever had in his life. For a man like him, holed up  in written reality, those stormy \nsessions that began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in  the brothels were a \nrevelation. It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the \nbest plaything that had ever been invented to make fun  of people, as Álvaro \ndemonstrated during one night of revels. Some time wo uld have to pass before \nAureliano realized that such arbitrary attitudes had  their origins in the example of \nthe wise Catalonian, for whom wisdom was worth nothing  if it could not be used \nto invent a way of preparing chick peas. \nThe afternoon on which Aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches, the \nargument ended up in the house of the girls who went to bed because of hunger, \na brothel of lies on the outskirts of Macondo. The propr ietress was a smiling \nmamasanta , tormented by a mania for opening and closing doors. Her eternal \nsmile seemed to have been brought on by the credulity o f her customers, who \naccepted as something certain an establishment that did n ot exist except in the \nimagination, because even the tangible things there w ere unreal: the furniture \nthat fell apart when one sat on it, the disemboweled phonograph with a nesting \nhen inside, the garden of paper flowers, the calendar s going back to the years \nbefore the arrival of the banana company, the frames w ith prints cut out of \nmagazines that had never been published. Even the ti mid little whores who came \nfrom the neighborhood: when the proprietress informed  them that customers had \narrived they were nothing but an invention. They wou ld appear without any \ngreeting in their little flowered dresses left over fr om days when they were five \nyears younger, and they took them off with the same inno cence with which they \nhad put them on, and in the paroxysms of love they wou ld exclaim good heavens, \nlook how that roof is falling in, and as soon as they got  their peso and fifty cents",
            "12": "they would spend it on a roll with cheese that the prop rietress sold them, smiling \nmore than ever, because only she knew that that meal w as not true either. \nAureliano, whose world at that time began with Melqu íades’ parchments and \nended in Nigromanta’s bed, found a stupid cure for ti midity in the small imaginary \nbrothel. At first he could get nowhere, in rooms where  the proprietress would \nenter during the best moments of love and make all sort s of comments about the \nintimate charms of the protagonists. But with time he began to get so familiar with \nthose misfortunes of the world that on one night that was more unbalanced than \nthe others he got undressed in the small reception room  an d  r an  th r ou gh  t h e \nhouse balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable ma leness. He was the one \nwho made fashionable the extravagances that the propri etress celebrated with \nher eternal smile, without protesting, without belie ving in them just as when \nGermán tried to burn the house down to show that it did not exist, and as when \nAlfonso wrung the neck of the parrot and threw it into  the pot where the chicken \nstew was beginning to boil. \nAlthough Aureliano felt himself linked to the four fr iends by a common \naffection and a common solidarity, even to the point wh ere he thought of them as \nif they were one person, he was closer to Gabriel than t o the others. The link was \nborn on the night when he casually mentioned Colonel Aureliano Buendía and \nGabriel was the only one who did not think that he wa s making fun of somebody. \nEven the proprietress, who normally did not take part i n the conversation argued \nwith a madam’s wrathful passion that Colonel Aurelian o Buendía, of whom she \nhad indeed heard speak at some time, was a figure inven ted by the government \nas a pretext for killing Liberals. Gabriel, on the oth er hand, did not doubt the \nreality of Colonel Aureliano Buendía because he had b een a companion in arms \nand inseparable friend of his great-great-grandfather  Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. \nThose fickle tricks of memory were even more critical when the killing of the \nworkers was brought up. Every time that Aureliano menti oned the matter, not only",
            "13": "the proprietress but some people older than she would repudiate the myth of the \nworkers hemmed in at the station and the train with tw o hundred cars loaded with \ndead people, and they would even insist that, after a ll, everything had been set \nforth in judicial documents and in primary-school textb ooks: that the banana \ncompany had never existed. So that Aureliano and Gabrie l were linked by a kind \nof complicity based on real facts that no one believed i n, and which had affected \ntheir lives to the point that both of them found the mselves off course in the tide of \na world that had ended and of which only the nostalgi a remained. Gabriel would \nsleep wherever time overtook him. Aureliano put him u p several times in the \nsilver workshop, but he would spend his nights awake, distu rbed by the noise of \nthe dead people who walked through the bedrooms until  dawn . Later h e tu rn ed \nhim over to Nigromanta, who took him to her well-used  room when she was free \nand put down his account with vertical marks behind the d oor in the few spaces \nleft free by Aureliano’s debts. \nIn spite of their disordered life, the whole group tr ied to do something \npermanent at the urging of the wise Catalonian. It w as he, with his experience as \na former professor of classical literature and his storehou se of rare books, who \ngot them to spend a whole night in search of the thir ty-seventh dramatic situation \nin a town where no one had any interest any more in go ing beyond primary \nschool. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, bewilder ed by the \nenchantments of a world which had been forbidden to him by Fernanda’s \nmeanness, Aureliano abandoned the scrutiny of the parchme nts precisely when \nthey were beginning to reveal themselves as predictions in coded lines of poetry. \nBut the subsequent proof that there was time enough f or everything without \nhaving to give up the brothels gave him the drive to return to Melquíades’ room, \nhaving decided not to flag in his efforts until he had discovered the last keys. That \nwas during the time that Gaston began to wait for the  a i r pl an e  an d  A m a r an t a  \nÚrsula was so lonely that one morning she appeared in t he room.",
            "14": "“Hello, cannibal,” she said to him. “Back in your cave aga in?” \nShe was irresistible, with a dress she had designed and o ne of the long \nshad-vertebra necklaces that she herself had made. She ha d stopped using the \nleash, convinced of her husband’s faithfulness, and for th e first time since her \nreturn she seemed to have a moment of ease. Aurelian o did not need to see her \nto know that she had arrived. She put her elbows on t he table, so close and so \nhelpless that Aureliano heard the deep sound of her b ones, and she became \ninterested in the parchments. Trying to overcome his dist urbance, he grasped at \nthe voice that he was losing, the life that was leaving  him, the memory that was \nturning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her ab out the priestly destiny of \nSanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future sh owing through in time as \none sees what is written on the back of a sheet of pape r through the light, the \nnecessity of deciphering the predictions so that they would  n o t  d e f e a t  \nthemselves, and the Centuries  of Nostradamus and the destruction of Cantabria \npredicted by Saint Milanus. Suddenly, without interrupt ing the chat, moved by an \nimpulse that had been sleeping in him since his origins, Aureliano put his hand on \nhers, thinking that that final decision would put an end to his doubts. She grabbed \nhis index finger with the affectionate innocence with w hich she had done so in \nchildhood, however, and she held it while he kept on answering questions. They \nremained like that, linked by icy index fingers that did not transmit anything in any \nway until she awoke from her momentary dream and slappe d her forehead with \nher hand. “The ants!” she exclaimed. And then she fo rgot about the manuscripts, \nwent to the door with a dance step, and from there sh e threw Aureliano a kiss \nwith the tips of her fingers as she had said good-bye to  h e r  f a t h e r  o n  t h e  \nafternoon when they sent her to Brussels. \n“You can tell me later,” she said. “I forgot that toda y’s the day to put \nquicklime on the anthills.”",
            "15": "She continued going to the room occasionally when she ha d something to \ndo in that part of the house and she would stay there for a few minutes while her \nhusband continued to scrutinize the sky. Encouraged by that change, Aureliano \nstayed to eat with the family at that time as he had no t done since the first months \nof Amaranta Úrsula’s return. Gaston was pleased. During  the conversations after \nmeals, which usually went on for more than an hour, h e complained that his \npartners were deceiving him. They had informed him of t he loading of the \nairplane on board a ship that did not arrive, and a lthough his shipping agents \ninsisted, that it would never arrive because it was not o n the list of Caribbean \nships, his partners insisted that the shipment was correct a nd they even \ninsinuated that Gaston was lying to them in his letters. The correspondence \nreached such a degree of mutual suspicion that Gaston d ecided not to write \nagain and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick t rip to Brussels to clear \nthings up and return with the airplane. The plan eva porated, however, as soon as \nAmaranta Úrsula reiterated her decision not to move f rom Macondo even if she \nlost a husband. During the first days Aureliano shared t he general opinion that \nGaston was a fool on a velocipede, and that brought on  a vague feeling of pity. \nLater, when he obtained deeper information on the n ature of men in the brothels, \nhe thought that Gaston’s meekness had its origins in unbr idled passion. But when \nhe came to know him better and realized his true char acter was the opposite of \nhis submissive conduct, he conceived the malicious suspicion t hat even the wait \nfor the airplane was an act. Then he thought that Gast on was not as foolish as he \nappeared, but, quite the contrary, was a man of infini te steadiness, ability, and \npatience who had set about to conquer his wife with t he weariness of eternal \nagreement, of never saying no, of simulating a limitless conformity, letting her \nbecome enmeshed in her own web until the day she could  n o  l on g e r  b e a r t h e \ntedium of the illusions close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back \nto Europe. Aureliano’s former pity turned into a viole nt dislike. Gaston’s system",
            "16": "seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effect ive, that he ventured to \nwarn Amaranta Úrsula. She made fun of his suspicions, however, without even \nnoticing the heavy weight of love, uncertainty, and je alousy that he had inside. It \nhad not occurred to her that she was arousing something more than fraternal \naffection in Aureliano until she pricked her finger tr ying to open a can of peaches \nand he dashed over to suck the blood out with an avid ity and a devotion that sent \na chill up her spine. \n“Aureliano!” She laughed, disturbed. “You’re too susp icious to be a good \nbat.” \nThen Aureliano went all out. Giving her some small, or phaned kisses in the \nhollow of her wounded hand, he opened up the most hi dden passageways of his \nheart and drew out an interminable and lacerated int estine, the terrible parasitic \nanimal that had incubated in his martyrdom. He told h er how he would get up at \nmidnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the unde rwear that she had left to \ndry in the bathroom. He told her about the anxiety wit h which he had asked \nNigromanta to howl like a cat and sob gaston gaston gasto n in his ear, and with \nhow much astuteness he had ransacked her vials of perfume  so that he could \nsmell it on the necks of the little girls who went to be d because of hunger. \nFrightened by the passion of that outburst, Amaranta Úr sula was closing her \nfingers, contracting them like a shellfish until her wo unded hand, free of all pain \nand any vestige of pity, was converted into a knot of em eralds and topazes and \nstony and unfeeling bones. \n“Fool!” she said as if she were spitting. “I’m sailing on  the first ship leaving \nfor Belgium.” \nÁlvaro had come to the wise Catalonian’s bookstore one o f those afternoons \nproclaiming at the top of his lungs his latest discovery: a  zoological brothel.

In wire pens that surrounded the dance floor an d among large Amazonian \ncamellias there were herons of different colors, crocodile s as fat as pigs, snakes \nwith twelve rattles, and a turtle with a gilded shel l who dove in a small artificial \nocean. There was a big white dog, meek and a pederast, who would give stud \nservices nevertheless in order to be fed.

The first night that the group visited that g reenhouse of illusions the \nsplendid and taciturn old woman who guarded the entra nce in a wicker rocking \nchair felt that time was turning back to its earliest ori gins when among the five \nwho were arriving she saw a bony, jaundiced man with Ta rtar cheekbones, \nmarked forever and from the beginning of the world w ith the pox of solitude. \n“Lord, Lord,” she sighed, “Aureliano!” \nShe was seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendía once more as she had seen him \nin the light of a lamp long before the wars, long be fore the desolation of glory and \nthe exile of disillusionment, that remote dawn when he went to her bedroom to \ngive the first command of his life: the command to give  him love. It was Pilar \nTernera. Years before, when she had reached one hund red forty-five years of \nage, she had given up the pernicious custom of keeping track of her age and she \nwent on living in the static and marginal time of memo ries, in a future perfectly \nrevealed and established, beyond the futures disturbed by the insidious snares \nand suppositions of her cards. \nFrom that night on Aureliano, took refuge in the comp assionate tenderness \nand understanding of his unknown great-great-grandmoth er. Sitting in her wicker \nrocking chair, she would recall the past, reconstruct the g randeur and misfortunes \nof the family and the splendor of Macondo, which was no w erased, while Álvaro \nfrightened the crocodiles with his noisy laughter and Alf onso invented outlandish",

That true brothel, with that maternal proprietress, was the world of \nwhich Aureliano had dreamed during his prolonged capt ivity. He felt so well, so \nclose to perfect companionship, that he thought of no o ther refuge on the \nafternoon on which Amaranta Úrsula had made his illusi ons crumble. He was \nready to unburden himself with words so that someone coul d break the knots that \nbound his chest, but he only managed to let out a flui d, warm, and restorative \nweeping in Pilar Ternera’s lap. She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips \nof her fingers, and without his having revealed that he was weeping from love, \nshe recognized immediately the oldest sobs in the history of  man. \n“It’s all right, child,” she consoled him. “Now tell me who it is.” \nWhen Aureliano told her, Pilar Ternera let out a de ep laugh, the old \nexpansive laugh that ended up as a cooing of doves.

With  a brutal tug he pulled off \nher bathrobe before she had time to resist and he loom ed over an abyss of newly \nwashed nudity whose skin color, lines of fuzz, and hidden m oles had all been \nimagined in the shadows of the other rooms. Amaranta Úrsula defended herself \nsincerely with the astuteness of a wise woman, weaseling he r slippery, flexible, \nand fragrant weasel’s body as she tried to knee him in t he kidneys and scorpion \nhis face with her nails, but without either of them gi ving a gasp that might not \nhave been taken for that breathing of a person watchin g the meager April sunset \nthrough the open window. It was a fierce fight, a bat tle to the death, but it seemed \nto be without violence because it consisted of distorted attacks and ghostly \nevasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that during it all t here was time for the \npetunias to bloom and for Gaston to forget about his aviator’s dream in the next \nroom, as if they were two enemy lovers seeking reconciliati on at the bottom of an \naquarium. In the heat of that savage and ceremonious st ruggle, Amaranta Úrsula \nunderstood that her meticulous silence was so irrational  that it could awaken the \nsuspicions of her nearby husband much more than the sound  of warfare that they \nwere trying to avoid. Then she began to laugh with h er lips tight together, without \ngiving up the fight, but defending herself with fals e bites and deweaseling her \nbody little by little until they both were conscious of be ing adversaries and \naccomplices at the same time and the affray degenerated i nto a conventional \ngambol and the attacks became caresses. Suddenly, almost playf ully, like one \nmore bit of mischief, Amaranta Úrsula dropped her de fense, and when she tried \nto recover, frightened by what she herself had made po ssible, it was too late.

In accordance with \nher last wishes she was not buried in a coffin but sitti ng in her rocker, which eight \nmen lowered by ropes into a huge hole dug in the cente r of the dance floor. The \nmulatto girls, dressed in black, pale from weeping, inve nted shadowy rites as they \ntook off their earrings, brooches, and rings and threw them into the pit before it \nwas closed over with a slab that bore neither name nor  dates, and that was \ncovered with a pile of Amazonian camellias. After poiso ning the animals they \nclosed up the doors and windows with brick and mortar an d they scattered out \ninto the world with their wooden trunks that were lin ed with pictures of saints, \nprints from magazines, and the portraits of sometime swee thearts, remote and \nfantastic, who shat diamonds, or ate cannibals, or were cr owned playing-card \nkings on the high seas. \nIt was the end. In Pilar Ternera’s tomb, among the psa lm and cheap whore \njewelry, the ruins of the past would rot, the little t hat remained after the wise Cat-\nalonian had auctioned off his bookstore and returned to  the Mediterranean village \nwhere he had been born, overcome by a yearning for a l asting springtime. No \none could have foreseen his decision. He had arrived in  Macondo during the \nsplendor of the banana company, fleeing from one of ma ny wars, and nothing \nmore practical had occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula \nand first editions in several languages, which casual cu stomers would thumb \nthrough cautiously, as if they were junk books, as they w aited their turn to have \ntheir dreams interpreted in the house across the way. He spent half his life in the \nback of the store, scribbling in his extra-careful hand in  purple ink and on pages \nthat he tore out of school notebooks, and no one was sur e exactly what he was",

When Aureliano first met him he had two box es of those motley pages \nthat in some way made one think of Melquíades’ parchmen ts, and from that time \nuntil he left he had filled a third one, so it was re asonable to believe that he had \ndone nothing else during his stay in Macondo. The only pe ople with whom he \nmaintained relations were the four friends, whom he h ad exchanged their tops \nand kites for books, and he set them to reading Seneca a nd Ovid while they were \nstill in grammar school. He treated the classical writer s with a household \nfamiliarity, as if they had all been his roommates at som e period, and he knew \nmany things that should not have been known, such as t he fact that Saint \nAugustine wore a wool jacket under his habit that he di d not take off for fourteen \nyears and that Arnaldo of Villanova, the necromancer, wa s impotent since \nchildhood because of a scorpion bite. His fervor for the written word was an \ninterweaving of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. N ot even his own \nmanuscripts were safe from that dualism. Having learned Catalan in order to \ntranslate them, Alfonso put a roll of pages in his pocke ts, which were always full \nof newspaper clippings and manuals for strange trades, an d one night he lost \nthem in the house of the little girls who went to bed  because of hunger. When the \nwise old grandfather found out, instead of raising a r ow as had been feared, he \ncommented, dying with laughter, that it was the natura l destiny of literature. On \nthe other hand, there was no human power capable of p ersuading him not to take \nalong the three boxes when he returned to his native village, and he unleashed a \nstring of Carthaginian curses at the railroad inspectors who tried to ship them as \nfreight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with  him in the passenger \ncoach. “The world must be all fucked up,” he said then, “ when men travel first \nclass and literature goes as freight.” That was the last thing he was heard to say. \nHe had spent a dark week on the final preparations for the trip, because as the \nhour approached his humor was breaking down and things began to be",

They helped hi m like a child, \nfastening his tickets and immigration documents to his pocke ts with safety pins, \nmaking him a detailed list of what he must do from th e time he left Macondo until \nhe landed in Barcelona, but nonetheless he threw away a  pair of pants with half \nof his money in it without realizing it. The night b efore the trip, after nailing up the \nboxes and putting his clothing into the same suitcase t hat he had brought when \nhe first came, he narrowed his clam eyes, pointed with a  k i n d  o f  i m p u d e n t  \nbenediction at the stacks of books with which he had endu red during his exile, \nand said to his friends: \n“All that shit there I leave to you people!” \nThree months later they received in a large envelope t wenty-nine letters and \nmore than fifty pictures that he had accumulated during  t h e  l ei su r e  o f  t h e  h i gh  \nseas. Although he did not date them, the order in whi ch he had written the letters \nwas obvious. In the first ones, with his customary good hu mor, he spoke about \nthe difficulties of the crossing, the urge he had to t hrow the cargo officer \noverboard when he would not let him keep the three boxes in his cabin, the clear \nimbecility of a lady who was terrified at the number t hirteen, not out of superstition \nbut because she thought it was a number that had no en d, and the bet that he \nhad won during the first dinner because he had recogniz ed in the drinking water \non board the taste of the nighttime beets by the sprin gs of Lérida. With the \npassage of the days, however, the reality of life on boa rd mattered less and less \nto him and even the most recent and trivial happenings seemed worthy of \nnostalgia, because as the ship got farther away, his memo ry began to grow sad. \nThat process of nostalgia was also evident in the pictures.

Germán and Aureliano answered his letters. \nHe wrote so many during the first months that at that t ime they felt closer to him \nthan when he had been in Macondo, and they were almost  freed from the rancor \nthat he had left behind. At first he told them that everything was just the same, \nthat the pink snails were still in the house where he h ad been born, that the dry \nherring still had the same taste on a piece of toast, th at the waterfalls in the \nvillage still took on a perfumed smell at dusk. They wer e the notebook pages \nagain, woven with the purple scribbling, in which he dedicated a special \nparagraph to each one. Nevertheless, and although he h imself did not seem to \nnotice it, those letters of recuperation and stimulation  were slowly changing into \npastoral letters of disenchantment. One winter night w hile the soup was boiling in \nthe fireplace, he missed the heat of the back of his store , the buzzing of the sun \non the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train dur ing the lethargy of siesta \ntime, just as in Macondo he had missed the winter soup in  the fireplace, the cries \nof the coffee vendor, and the fleeting larks of springt ime. Upset by two nostalgias \nfacing each other like two mirrors, he lost his marvelou s sense of unreality and he \nended up recommending to all of them that they leave Macondo, that they forget \neverything he had taught them about the world and th e human heart, that they \nshit on Horace, and that wherever they might be they al ways remember that the \npast was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spr ing gone by could never \nbe recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious lo ve was an ephemeral \ntruth in the end. \nÁlvaro was the first to take the advice to abandon Macon do.

In \nthe postcards that he sent from the way stations he would describe with shouts \nthe instantaneous images that he had seen from the wind ow of his coach, and it \nwas as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivio n some long, evanescent \npoem: the chimerical Negroes in the cotton fields of Lo uisiana, the winged horses \nin the bluegrass of Kentucky, the Greek lovers in the infe rnal sunsets of Arizona, \nthe girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by a l ake in Michigan who waved \nat him with her brushes, not to say farewell but out o f hope, because she did not \nknow that she was watching a train with no return passi ng by. Then Alfonso and \nGermán left one Saturday with the idea of coming back o n Monday, but nothing \nmore was ever heard of them. A year after the departu re of the wise Catalonian \nthe only one left in Macondo was Gabriel, still adrift at the mercy of Nigromanta’s \nchancy charity and answering the questions of a contest in a  French magazine in \nwhich the first prize was a trip to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one who \nsubscribed to it, helped him fill in the answers, sometim es in his house but most \nof the time among the ceramic bottles and atmosphere o f valerian in the only \npharmacy left in Macondo, where Mercedes, Gabriel’s stealt hy girl friend, lived. It \nwas the last that remained of a past whose annihilation  had not taken place \nbecause it was still in a process of annihilation, consumi ng itself from within, \nending at every moment but never ending its ending. T he town had reached such \nextremes of inactivity that when Gabriel won the contest  and left for Paris with \ntwo changes of clothing, a pair of shoes, and the compl ete works of Rabelais, he \nhad to signal the engineer to stop the train and pick h im up.

In that Macondo forgotten even by the b irds, where the dust and \nthe heat had become so strong that it was difficult to b reathe, secluded by \nsolitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house  where it was almost \nimpossible to sleep because of the noise of the red ants,  A u r e l i a n o ,  a n d  \nAmaranta Úrsula were the only happy beings, and the m ost happy on the face of \nthe earth. \nGaston had returned to Brussels. Tired of waiting for t he airplane, one day \nhe put his indispensable things into a small suitcase, took his file of \ncorrespondence, and left with the idea of returning by air before his concession \nwas turned over to a group of German pilots who had p resented the provincial \nauthorities with a more ambitious project than his. Sin ce the afternoon of their first \nlove, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula had continued ta king advantage of her \nhusband’s rare unguarded moments, making love with gag ged ardor in chance \nmeetings and almost always interrupted by unexpected retur ns. But when they \nsaw themselves alone in the house they succumbed to the d elirium of lovers who \nwere making up for lost time. It was a mad passion, unhi nging, which made \nFernanda’s bones tremble with horror in her grave and which kept them in a state \nof perpetual excitement. Amaranta Úrsula’s shrieks, her songs of agony would \nbreak out the same at two in the afternoon on the din ing-room table as at two in \nthe morning in the pantry. “What hurts me most,” she wo uld say, laughing, “is all \nthe time that we wasted.” In the bewilderment of passi on she watched the ants \ndevastating the garden, sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam of the \nhouse, and she watched the torrents of living lava take over the porch again, but",

Aureliano \nabandoned the parchments, did not leave the house aga in, and carelessly \nanswered the letters from the wise Catalonian. They lost  their sense of reality, the \nnotion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed the doors and windows \nagain so as not to waste time getting undressed and they walked about the house \nas Remedios the Beauty had wanted to do and they would  roll around naked in \nthe mud of the courtyard, and one afternoon they almost  drowned as they made \nlove in the cistern. In a short time they did more dam age than the red ants: they \ndestroyed the furniture in the parlor, in their madne ss they tore to shreds the \nhammock that had resisted the sad bivouac loves of Colone l Aureliano Buendía \nand they disemboweled the mattresses and emptied them on  th e fl oor as th ey \nsuffocated in storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was ju st as ferocious a lover \nas his rival, it was Amaranta Úrsula who ruled in that  paradise of disaster with her \nmad genius and her lyrical voracity, as if she had concentr ated in her love the \nunconquerable energy that her great-great-grandmother  had given to the making \nof little candy animals. And yet, while she was singing w ith pleasure and dying \nwith laughter over her own inventions, Aureliano was becoming more and more \nabsorbed and silent, for his passion was self-centered and burning. Nevertheless, \nthey both reached such extremes of virtuosity that whe n they became exhausted \nfrom excitement, they would take advantage of their fa tigue. They would give \nthemselves over to the worship of their bodies, discove ring that the rest periods \nof love had unexplored possibilities, much richer tha n those of desire.

She felt him to be so far away and busy that h is return seemed impossible \nto her. In one of his first letters he told her that his Partners had actually sent the \nairplane, but that a shipping agent in Brussels had sen t it by mistake to \nTanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered trib e of the Makondos. That \nmix-up brought on so many difficulties that just to get the plane back might take \ntwo years. So Amaranta Úrsula dismissed the possibility of  an inopportune return. \nAureliano, for his part, had no other contact with the  world except for the letters \nfrom the wise Catalonian and the news he had of Gabri el through Mercedes, the \nsilent pharmacist. At first they were real contacts. Gabrie l had turned in his return \nticket in order to stay in Paris, selling the old newspape rs and empty bottles that \nthe chambermaids threw out of a gloomy hotel on the Rue Dauphine.

Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula  opened their eyes, dug \ndeep into their souls, looked at the letter with their  hands on their hearts, and \nunderstood that they were so close to each other that th ey preferred death to \nseparation.

Contrary to what they had expected, Gaston se nt them a calm, almost \npaternal reply, with two whole pages devoted to a war ning against the fickleness \nof passion and a final paragraph with unmistakable wish es for them to be as \nhappy as he had been during his brief conjugal experien ce. It was such an \nunforeseen attitude that Amaranta Úrsula felt humilia ted by the idea that she had \ngiven her husband the pretext that he had wanted in order to abandon her to her \nfate. The rancor was aggravated six months later when Gaston wrote again from \nLéopoldville, where he had finally recovered the airpl ane, simply to ask them to \nship him the velocipede, which of all that he had lef t behind in Macondo was the \nonly thing that had any sentimental value for him. Au reliano bore Amaranta \nÚrsula’s spite patiently and made an effort to show her that he could be as good \na husband in adversity as in prosperity, and the daily need s that besieged them \nwhen Gaston’s last money ran out created a bond of solida rity between them that \nwas not as dazzling and heady as passion, but that let the m make love as much \nand be as happy as during their uproarious and salacious days.

They survived miraculo usly. Although \nAmaranta Úrsula did not lose her good humor or her g enius for erotic mischief, \nshe acquired the habit of sitting on the porch after l unch in a kind of wakeful and \nthoughtful siesta.

            "9": "there in silence until nightfall, opposite each other , looking into each other’s eyes, \nloving each other as much as in their scandalous days. The  uncertainty of the \nfuture made them turn their hearts toward the past. T hey saw themselves in the \nlost paradise of the deluge, splashing in the puddles in the courtyard, killing \nlizards to hang on Úrsula, pretending that they were going to bury her alive, and \nthose memories revealed to them the truth that they ha d been happy together \never since they had had memory. Going deeper into the p ast, Amaranta Úrsula \nremembered the afternoon on which she had gone into  the silver shop and her \nmother told her that little Aureliano was nobody’s chi ld because he had been \nfound floating in a basket. Although the version seemed  unlikely to them, they did \nnot have any information enabling them to replace it with the true one. All that \nthey were sure of after examining an the possibilities w as that Fernanda was not \nAureliano’s mother. Amaranta Úrsula was inclined to be lieve that he was the son \nof Petra Cotes, of whom she remembered only tales of i nfamy, and that \nsupposition produced a twinge of horror in her heart.  \nTormented by the certainty that he was his wife’s brother , Aureliano ran out \nto the parish house to search through the moldy and mo th-eaten archives for \nsome clue to his parentage. The oldest baptismal certifi cate that he found was \nthat of Amaranta Buendía, baptized in adolescence by F ather Nicanor Reyna \nduring the time when he was trying to prove the existe nce of God by means of \ntricks with chocolate. He began to have that feeling tha t he was one of the \nseventeen Aurelianos, whose birth certificates he tracked d own as he went \nthrough four volumes, but the baptism dates were too f ar back for his age. Seeing \nhim lost in the labyrinths of kinship, trembling with uncertainty, the arthritic priest, \nwho was watching him from his hammock, asked him compassion ately what his \nname was. \n“Aureliano Buendía,” he said.",
            "10": "“Then don’t wear yourself out searching,” the priest excl aimed with final \nconviction. “Many years ago there used to be a street her e with that name and in \nthose days people had the custom of naming their children  after streets.” \nAureliano trembled with rage. \n“So!” he said. “You don’t believe it either.” \n“Believe what?” \n“That Colonel Aureliano, Buendía fought thirty-two ci vil wars and lost them \nall,” Aureliano answered. “That the army hemmed in an d machine-gunned three \nthousand workers and that their bodies were carried off to be thrown into the sea \non a train with two hundred cars.” \nThe priest measured him with a pitying look. \n“Oh, my son,” he signed. “It’s enough for me to be sure  that you and I exist \nat this moment.” \nSo Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula accepted the version of the basket, not \nbecause they believed it, but because it spared them th eir terror. As the \npregnancy advanced they were becoming a single being, the y were becoming \nmore and more integrated in the solitude of a house t hat needed only one last \nbreath to be knocked down. They restricted themselves to an  essential area, from \nFernanda’s bedroom, where the charms of sedentary love were visible, to the \nbeginning of the porch, where Amaranta Úrsula would sit to sew bootees and \nbonnets for the newborn baby and Aureliano, would answ er the occasional letters \nfrom the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house was giv en over to the tenacious \nassault of destruction. The silver shop, Melquíades’ roo m, the primitive and silent \nrealm of Santa Sofía de la Piedad remained in the d epths of a domestic jungle \nthat no one would have had the courage to penetrate.  Surrounded by the voracity \nof nature, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula continued cultivating the oregano and \nthe begonias and defended their world with demarcatio ns of quicklime, building \nthe last trenches in the age-old war between man and  a n t .

It had been mailed in Barcelona, but the  envelope was addressed in \nconventional blue ink by an official hand and it had th e innocent and impersonal \nlook of hostile messages. Aureliano snatched it out of A maranta Úrsula’s hands \nas she was about to open it. \n“Not this one,” he told her. “I don’t want to know wh at it says.” \nJust as he had sensed, the wise Catalonian did not write  a g a i n .

At night, holding each other in bed, th ey were not frightened by the \nsublunary explosions of the ants or the noise of the moth s or the constant and \nclean whistle of the growth of the weeds in the neighb oring rooms.

The smiling mistress of the little girls who  went to bed because of \nhunger had her get onto the dining-room table, strad dled her stomach, and \nmistreated her with wild gallops until her cries were d rowned out by the bellows of \na formidable male child. Through her tears Amaranta Úrsula could see that he \nwas one of those great Buendías, strong and willful like  the José Arcadios, with \nthe open and clairvoyant eyes of the Aurelianos, and pre disposed to begin the \nrace again from the beginning and cleanse it of its per nicious vices and solitary \ncalling, for he was the only one in a century who had be en engendered with love. \n“He’s a real cannibal.” she said. “We’ll name him Rodri go.” \n“No,” her husband countered. “We’ll name him Aurelia no and he’ll win thirty-\ntwo wars.” \nAfter cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife began t o use a cloth to take off \nthe blue grease that covered his body as Aureliano held up a lamp.

At dawn  on Monday they \nbrought a woman who recited cauterizing prayers that we re infallible for man and \nbeast beside her bed, but Amaranta Úrsula’s passionate b lood was insensible to \nany artifice that did not come from love. In the after noon, after twenty-four hours \nof desperation, they knew that she was dead because the  flow had stopped \nwithout remedies and her profile became sharp and the blotches on her face \nevaporated in a halo of alabaster and she smiled agai n. \nAureliano did not understand until then how much he loved his friends, how \nmuch he missed them, and how much he would have given to be with them at \nthat moment. He put the child in the basket that his m other had prepared for him, \ncovered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and wande red aimlessly through \nthe town, searching for an entrance that went back to th e past. He knocked at the \ndoor of the pharmacy, where he had not visited lately, a nd he found a carpenter \nshop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on \nhis delirium and insisted that, no, there had never b een a pharmacy there, nor \nhad she ever known a woman with a thin neck and sleep y eyes named \nMercedes. He wept, leaning his brow against the door of  the wise Catalonian’s \nformer bookstore, conscious that he was paying with his tard y sobs for a death \nthat he had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love. He \nsmashed his fists against the cement wall of The Golden C hild, calling for Pilar \nTernera, indifferent to the luminous orange disks that  were crossing the sky and \nthat so many times on holiday nights he had contemplated with childish",
            "14": "fascination from the courtyard of the curlews. In the la st open salon of the \ntumbledown red-light district an accordion group was pla ying the songs of Rafael \nEscalona, the bishop’s nephew, heir to the secrets of Fra ncisco the Man. The \nbartender, who had a withered and somewhat crumpled a rm because he had \nraised it against his mother, invited Aureliano to have a bottle of cane liquor, and \nAureliano then bought him one. The bartender spoke to  him about the misfortune \nof his arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune  of his heart, withered and \nsomewhat crumpled for having been raised against his siste r. They ended up \nweeping together and Aureliano felt for a moment th at the pain was over. But \nwhen he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, h e opened up his arms in \nthe middle of the square, ready to wake up the whole w orld, and he shouted with \nall his might: \n“Friends are a bunch of bastards!” \nNigromanta rescued him from a pool of vomit and tears. She took him to her \nroom, cleaned him up, made him drink a cup of broth. Thinking that it would \nconsole him, she took a piece of charcoal and erased the  innumerable loves that \nhe still owed her for, and she voluntarily brought up  her own most solitary \nsadnesses so as not to leave him alone in his weeping. Wh en he awoke, after a \ndull and brief sleep, Aureliano recovered the awarene ss of his headache. He \nopened his eyes and remembered the child. \nHe could not find the basket. At first he felt an outbu rst of joy, thinking that \nAmaranta Úrsula had awakened from death to take care o f the child. But her \ncorpse was a pile of stones under the blanket. Aware tha t when he arrived he had \nfound the -door to the bedroom open, Aureliano went  across the porch which was \nsaturated with the morning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining room, \nwhere the remnants of the birth still lay: the large p ot, the bloody sheets, the jars \nof ashes, and the twisted umbilical cord of the child on  an opened diaper on the \ntable next to the shears and the fishline. The idea that the midwife had returned",
            "15": "for the child during the night gave him a pause of re st in which to think. He sank \ninto the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca ha d sat during the early \ndays of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which  Amaranta had played \nChinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Márquez, and in  w h i c h  A m a r a n t a  \nÚrsula had sewn the tiny clothing for the child, and in  that flash of lucidity he \nbecame aware that he was unable to bear in his soul the  crushing weight of so \nmuch past. Wounded by the fatal lances of his own nostalg ia and that of others, \nhe admired the persistence of the spider webs on the dea d rose bushes, the \nperseverance of the rye grass, the patience of the air in  the radiant February \ndawn. And then he saw the child. It was a dry and bloa ted bag of skin that all the \nants in the world were dragging toward their holes al ong the stone path in the \ngarden. Aureliano could not move. Not because he was pa ralyzed by horror but \nbecause at that prodigious instant Melquíades’ final keys were revealed to him \nand he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly pla ced in the order of man’s \ntime and space: The first of the line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by \nthe ants . \nAureliano, had never been more lucid in any act of his  life as when he forgot \nabout his dead ones and the pain of his dead ones and n ailed up the doors and \nwindows again with Fernanda’s crossed boards so as not to b e disturbed by any \ntemptations of the world, for he knew then that his f ate was written in Melquíades’ \nparchments. He found them intact among the prehistoric p lants and steaming \npuddles and luminous insects that had removed all trace o f man’s passage on \nearth from the room, and he did not have the calmness to bring them out into the \nlight, but right there, standing, without the slighte st difficulty, as if they had been \nwritten in Spanish and were being read under the da zzling splendor of high noon, \nhe began to decipher them aloud. It was the history of  the family, written by \nMelquíades, down to the most trivial details, one hund red years ahead of time. \nHe had written it in Sanskrit, which was his mother ton gue, and he had encoded",
            "16": "the even lines in the private cipher of the Emperor A ugustus and the odd ones in \na Lacedemonian military code. The final protection, whi ch Aureliano had begun to \nglimpse when he let himself be confused by the love of Amaranta Úrsula, was \nbased on the fact that Melquíades had not put events in  t h e  o r d e r  o f  m a n ’ s  \nconventional time, but had concentrated a century of dai ly episodes in such a \nway that they coexisted in one instant. Fascinated by the  discovery, Aureliano, \nread aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals that M elquíades himself had \nmade Arcadio listen to and that were in reality the pr ediction of his execution, and \nhe found the announcement of the birth of the most be autiful woman in the world \nwho was rising up to heaven in body and soul, and he fo und the origin of the \nposthumous twins who gave up deciphering the parchments,  not simply through \nincapacity and lack of drive, but also because their attem pts were premature. At \nthat point, impatient to know his own origin, Aurelia no skipped ahead. Then the \nwind began, warm, incipient, full of voices from the p ast, the murmurs of ancient \ngeraniums, sighs of disenchantment that preceded the most  tenacious nostalgia. \nHe did not notice it because at that moment he was discov ering the first \nindications of his own being in a lascivious grandfather  who let himself be \nfrivolously dragged along across a hallucinated plateau in search of a beautiful \nwoman who would not make him happy. Aureliano recogni zed him, he pursued \nthe hidden paths of his descent, and he found the instan t of his own conception \namong the scorpions and the yellow butterflies in a sun set bathroom where a \nmechanic satisfied his lust on a woman who was giving herse lf out of rebellion. \nHe was so absorbed that he did not feel the second surge  of wind either as its \ncyclonic strength tore the doors and windows off their hin ges, pulled off the roof \nof the east wing, and uprooted the foundations. Only t hen did he discover that \nAmaranta Úrsula was not his sister but his aunt, and th at Sir Francis Drake had \nattacked Riohacha only so that they could seek each other t hrough the most \nintricate labyrinths of blood until they would engende r the mythological animal",
            "17": "that was to bring the line to an end. Macondo was alre ady a fearful whirlwind of \ndust and rubble being spun about by the wrath of the biblical hurricane when \nAureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time wit h facts he knew only too \nwell, and he began to decipher the instant that he w as living, deciphering it as he \nlived it, prophesying himself in the act of deciphering the last page of the \nparchments, as if he were looking into a speaking mirror.  Then he skipped again \nto anticipate the predictions and ascertain the date a nd circumstances of his \ndeath. Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he \nwould never leave that room, for it was foreseen that  the city of mirrors (or \nmirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled fr om the memory of men at \nthe precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would fin ish deciphering the \nparchments, and that everything written on them was unre peatable since time \nimmemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years \nof solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.  \n \n \nTHE END."
